<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   The proposal before us today would require the President to release small amounts of sweet, light crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That oil would be replaced by heavy crude, at a later date and at a lower price. 
   In the face of record high oil prices, this is a common sense step for a number of reasons. 
   First, earlier releases from the SPR, by each of the last three Presidents, brought down oil prices by between 9 percent and 33 percent within weeks. There is no reason to believe that we won't see a similar result today. Putting more oil on the market is a sure way to reduce prices. 
   Second, we have the SPR in place for national emergencies. The damage that these high oil prices are doing to individual consumers and to our economy as a whole certainly qualifies as such an emergency. In addition, the SPR is already at a record 97 percent of capacity and this legislation requires that it not drop below 90 percent. 
   Third, releasing oil from the SPR is one of the few steps that we can take to actually affect prices immediately. President Bush and his supporters continue to call for opening our entire coast to new drilling and to begin exploring in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. But this failed ``drill-only'' strategy would have zero effect on oil prices today and is what has  gotten us into this mess in the first place. It would simply be one more gift for a favored special interest of this Administration, the oil and gas industry. 
   Democrats have a better plan. We are working on legislation to crack down on what appears to be rampant speculation that may be driving up prices by as much as 20 percent, according to some experts. In addition, we have voted to force oil and gas companies to drill on the lands they have leased or lose access to them and to speed up construction of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. If enacted, that legislation would help increase supply in the medium term. 
   For the long term, we have enacted expansion of many energy efficiency measures, such as the first increase in auto efficiency standards in 32 years, that will help us use less energy across our economy. And we are moving forward with greater incentives to encourage the use of alternative and renewable resources. We must continue to build on these measures so we can begin a much-needed transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels. 
   But these measures, as critically important as they are, will take time. In the meantime we have to move to help consumers today. And that is what this legislation would do. 
   Madam Speaker, high gas prices are hurting the American people and crippling our economy. 
   While we have seen the price of oil drop by some $20 a barrel in the last week or two, it is still at ridiculously high levels and prices at the pump are still way over $4 a gallon in my district and many others. 
   And while my constituents across the South and Central Coast are finding it hard to afford to go to the grocery store, take their kids to soccer and even get to work, the big oil companies are once again reporting record profits. 
   This is an absolute disgrace and this Congress is moving to put an end to that situation with this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this common sense bill to help American consumers.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5501. 
   Every day, 6,000 people become infected with HIV, over 1,000 of whom are babies. 
   We have made terrific advancements in treating and preventing HIV/AIDS, but they mean nothing unless we ensure that the most vulnerable populations have access to them. 
   Since its inception, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, has saved countless lives and increasing our investment through this reauthorization will save millions more. 
   I am especially proud to see that this reauthorization places stronger emphasis on prevention. 
   Without increased efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS, we will never adequately address the long-term needs of the global HIV/AIDS population and global health overall. 
   This bill takes important steps to increase prevention efforts by overturning the ineffective one-third abstinence-only requirement that currently applies to global HIV/AIDS prevention funding; providing an increased focus on women and girls who are at-risk; and setting a target for PEPFAR to provide 80 percent of pregnant women with the tools they need to prevent maternal-to-child transmission of HIV. 
   Finally I am thrilled to see an increased investment in helping countries to expand their healthcare workforce as they face drastic shortages in skilled healthcare workers. 
   During my recent visit to Africa with the House Democracy Assistance Commission, I had the opportunity to visit with doctors, nurses and ministries of health in several countries. 
   They are desperate for more professionals who can treat individuals affected with HIV/AIDS, especially in countries like Malawi where 15 percent of the population suffers from HIV/AIDS. 
   Our investments and improvements of PEPFAR fulfill a moral responsibility that we are accountable to. 
   Our steadfast commitment to PEPFAR is also one of our proudest foreign policy accomplishments over the past few years as we provide the necessary humanitarian assistance required for countries to sustain themselves in the long-term. 
   Finally, I would like to also applaud the provision removing the ban on visas for HIV-infected individuals wishing to come to the United States. This mean spirited statute should have been repealed long ago and I am glad to see that it is finally being ended. Only a few countries have such a policy and America should not be one of them. 
   I urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support this legislation and I look forward to the success we are sure to see in addressing the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1108. This bill is about bringing smoking prevention and cessation efforts into the 21st century. 
   We have known for a long time about the health dangers--in fact, the life-threatening dangers--posed by tobacco use. Nobody uses tobacco because they think it's good for their health. What this bill does is to take the necessary steps which will most effectively help people quit, and most importantly, help them never to begin. 
   One of the ways that goal is accomplished through this legislation is by  giving greater authority to the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the advertising and marketing of tobacco products. By prohibiting the targeted marketing of tobacco products to children, we can help prevent countless young people from falling prey to deceptive advertising, the kind that describes smoking with the same adjectives used to describe candy and perfume, with the many enticing qualities. 
   Now, some of the bill's opponents may try to say the FDA is ill-equipped to do this. I just want to remind my colleagues that this bill provides the FDA new resources to handle tobacco regulation, and it's based upon a plan the agency itself devised over a decade ago. 
   I want to thank many colleagues who have worked tirelessly over years to bring us to this moment on this floor. I want to thank Mr. Waxman for his tireless leadership. I want to thank the leadership of our committee, Mr. Pallone, and most particularly our esteemed chairman, for whom this day will mark a very special moment and milestone. 
   I urge all of my colleagues in this House to vote in favor of H.R. 1108.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CAMEL NO. 9 CIGARETTES -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss an important public health issue, particularly for young women and girls. 
   As a mother, grandmother and a former school nurse, I know all about the annual back-to-school shopping ritual. Each fall, kids and parents hit the stores to stock up on school supplies and new clothes. Unfortunately, this fall there's a new must-have item being advertised, and believe it or not, it's Camel No. 9 cigarettes. 
   It's being brought to our daughters, granddaughters and nieces by the folks at R.J. Reynolds, the same company that thought cartoon character Joe Camel was a responsible product spokesman. 
   Camel No. 9 cigarettes are just the pink version of Joe Camel, or as one Oregon newspaper put it, ``Barbie Camel.'' And R.J. Reynolds' tobacco marketing strategy is complete with fashionable giveaways to young women that include berry lip balm and mini hot pink purses. 
   The tag line for Camel No. 9 is ``light and luscious,'' which sounds more like a tasty treat than a cancer-causing cigarette. Now there's even a Camel No. 9 stiletto line which evokes images of the sexy shoes. 
   Well, I'd like to remind R.J. Reynolds that there's nothing sexy about emphysema or dying prematurely from cancer. No amount of pretty pink packaging can obscure the fact that lung cancer is the number one cancer killer among American women, a truth that underscores big tobacco's desperate search for new smokers. 
   While we expect this kind of sleazy marketing from tobacco companies, I've been terribly disappointed that they've found a new and unexpected ally in women's fashion magazines. These magazines set the styles and trends for the country. They have historically served as legitimate sources for information on women's health and fitness, and they've sold out the well-being of their readers to help big tobacco in their search for new victims. 
   So back in June, 40 of my colleagues joined me in writing to the publishers of 11 leading women's magazines. We asked them to voluntarily stop accepting misleading advertising for deadly cigarettes, particularly for Camel No. 9. When not one of these magazines bothered to formally respond to our first letter, we wrote again. 
   This time seven of them did respond, but none have committed to drop the ads. Several defended themselves by pointing to their editorials on the dangers of smoking, but how can a young impressionable reader possibly take that seriously when they can flip the page and find an advertisement for cigarettes that make them look as sexy and sophisticated as perfume? 
   Just look at this ad printed in the October edition of ``Glamour.'' This ``Dressed to the 9s'' piece encourages the ``fashion forward'' woman to embrace a vintage look and more closely resembles the magazine's regular editorial content on the latest fashions. The ad also helpfully recommends starting a vintage makeover with a little black dress. 
   Quite frankly, it would be more appropriate to exhibit how it would look with black lungs and yellowed teeth readers would have after a life of smoking. 
   This sort of deceptive advertising is brilliant in the eyes of marketers but shameful in the eyes of anyone who cares about public health. These ads are obviously targeted to appeal to young women and girls. 
   And although this magazine may claim that girls and teens are only a small fraction of their readership, I think that everyone can relate to the familiar scene of a young girl in line at the grocery store with her mom, flipping through the magazines that the cool older girls are reading. This is exactly what they would see in this issue of ``Glamour.'' There's two more pages I don't have time to flip through myself. 
   Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen recently wrote on Camel No. 9 cigarettes and this deliberate effort to appeal to young women and girls. In her piece she noted that her own 18-year-old daughter had tried Camel No. 9, describing its taste and smell with words like perfume, caramel, and chai tea. 
   So R.J. Reynolds and leading women's fashion magazines are pushing pink stiletto cigarettes that smell like perfume, taste like chai on ad pages that are virtually indistinguishable from the regular fashion content of the magazine. Yet, they continue to insist that this ad blitz, timed perfectly to coincide with the start of school, is in no way targeting our children? It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. 
   Tomorrow, we're going to be having a hearing on H.R. 1108, introduced by my colleague HENRY WAXMAN, which would give FDA the authority to regulate tobacco, including advertising, and I hope that the magazines that are printing these ads don't wait until Congress passes a law in order to do the right thing. 
   If the Camel No. 9 advertising blitz that greeted our students at the start of the school year is any indication of their intentions, I shudder to think of the tricks and treats R.J. Reynolds and its new friends in the magazine business have in store for our young women and girls this Halloween.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H. Res. 635, a resolution honoring the month of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal. This is an important resolution in support of our Muslim friends, neighbors and citizens. 
   In my district we have many distinguished Muslim residents who contribute extensively to our community. They work tirelessly to educate our community about their faith and work to build interfaith relationships across our communities. For this I am deeply grateful. Their efforts, along with those of other people of faith in my district, are enabling us to build a strong and pluralistic environment that promotes tolerance and diversity. 
   In this time of international conflict, it is critical that we demonstrate solidarity with and support for members of the Muslim community in the United States and throughout the world. In two weeks I will be bringing faith leaders from across my district, including Jews, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists, to Washington, DC, for a day of discussions with Members of Congress and advocacy organizations to help further the important interfaith work already underway throughout the Central Coast of California. 
   I am grateful for all of the people of faith in my district who are working to promote peace and justice through understanding. 
   May this month of Ramadan bring us all closer to realizing a peaceful society at home and abroad. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank Chairman Rahall for his excellent leadership in crafting this legislation, the DRILL Act, which I strongly support. 
   The oil and gas companies, awash in profits, would have us believe they have nowhere to drill. That is just plain wrong. 
   According to the Bush administration, 80 percent of our oil and gas resources are available for drilling. The industry is sitting on 68 million acres of public lands where it could be drilling, but isn't. And with this bill today we are speeding up the effort to drill in the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve. 
   We don't need to open up more areas for drilling when industry is dragging its feet on producing where it already could. This recent push by President Bush to open up the rest of our coast to offshore drilling is a political stunt. It is not about lowering gas prices today or even in the near future. It is just a cynical attempt to change the subject from this administration's abject failure on energy. 
   The great oilmen rode into the White House 7 1/2 years ago boasting about their new energy policy. Their great plan, now 95 percent implemented, has now resulted in $4 a gallon in gas, $500 billion in oil company profits, and an economy in crisis. 
   Those of us who opposed the Bush-Cheney energy plan did so because we knew this was the likely result.  
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have a better idea, one that meets today's crisis and transitions us to a new energy future. We believe the President should release a small amount of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have done it before, and it works. It would likely bring prices down more in 10 days than the Bush-McCain offshore drilling plan would in 10 years. 
   In addition, oil companies should drill in the vast stretches of this country where they are now permitted, and the Bush administration should open up drilling in the Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve, build the pipelines and sell that oil and gas to Americans. 
   Finally, we must seriously ramp up our transition to alternative and renewable energy sources. If, in 10 years, oil and gas are still the focus of our energy debates, we surely will have failed. That would mean following the path that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have charted, and we know where that leads us. 
   We need to change direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Chairman, an original cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, I rise in strong support of the bill. 
   Last November, Americans responded to our commitment to change, and voted in the  new Democratic majority. Last month we affirmed that commitment by voting to increase the minimum wage--the first increase in over a decade. Today, we further that commitment by helping to increase access to health care, better pay, and better retirement benefits for millions of American workers by passing the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   America's workforce desperately needs our help. During this period of so-called economic growth, American workers have seen their incomes flat-line while the salaries of the wealthiest one percent have skyrocketed. They have seen the costs of basic necessities such as health care, education, transportation, food and housing rise while the number of quality jobs falls. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act will help narrow this growing income disparity by making it easier for American workers to unionize if they so choose. Statistics show that unionized workers earn higher wages, have greater access to health care, and receive better retirement benefits. This bill will level the playing field and help narrow the growing income gap that is plaguing our Nation. 
   The ability of workers to unionize is a fundamental right that must be protected. While many employers treat their workers fairly, and respect their right to unionize, many more do not. For far too long, some employers have routinely restricted the rights of workers by threatening, coercing and even firing employees who attempt to form a union. 
   Opponents of the bill claim that current law adequately protects the rights of workers who want to form a union. However, any American worker will tell you that it does no such thing. 
   Under current law, employers can force employees to attend mandatory, closed-door meetings to listen to anti-union propaganda, while employees I are denied the right to rebut. 
   Under current law, employers can block the formation of a union by dragging out negotiations indefinitely, while employees are denied the collective representation they voted for. 
   And, under current law, employers routinely fire workers for merely discussing union activities, and employees are denied their pay while the NLRB takes months to take action. 
   The truth is that the system is badly broken, and must be repaired. This bill would begin to fix the system by making it easier for employees to form unions and giving workers a fair seat at the bargaining table by establishing a system of mediation and arbitration. 
   Too many employees have been denied their rights for far too long. It is time that we stand up and protect America's workers from the abuse, coercion, and intimidation they have endured for generations. While much work still must be done to protect these workers, the Employee Free Choice Act is a strong step in the right direction. 
   I urge my colleagues to help America's workers, and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 800.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill and in support of America's children. We have two choices today: we can vote for this excellent bipartisan bill, which Senator Hatch appropriately called ``an honest compromise which improves a program that works,'' or we can vote against this bill and not only deny millions of children the chance to finally access health care, but strip it away from children who are already covered. 
   Trust me: as a nurse, I know the power and prudence of providing this health care coverage for our kids. It is indeed an accomplishment that Congress can be proud of. 
   This bill is responsible, and it's the right thing to do. Make no mistake, it is a compromise bill. But if we fail to pass this bill and even one child loses health coverage, we have failed our most important constituents, our children. 
   I urge my colleagues, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Vote ``yes'' to protect children's health. ``Suffer the little children.''

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 1553, the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. It is very fitting that we have named this legislation in memory of Caroline Pryce Walker, daughter of this bill's champion, my dear colleague, Deborah Pryce. 
   This bill is going to take necessary and important steps to address specific needs of pediatric cancer in at least three significant ways. It will ensure that we have enough qualified pediatric oncologists and nurses. It will improve clinical trials for the treatment of cancer in children. Finally, it would also conduct more public awareness about treatment options and support for children with cancer and their families. 
   As one of the co-chairs of the Cancer Caucus, along with my colleague from Ohio, I am so proud to see this bill, which was one of our priorities, and a personal priority as we all know, moving forward. 
   I want to share a bit about how the momentum behind this bill has already spurred people across the country into action. 
   Just this past Saturday, I attended an event in my town of Santa Barbara called ``Kids for a Cure.'' Amazingly, it was organized by Madison Lewandowski, an 8-year-old constituent of mine, who, despite being so young, knows that she can make a difference in the lives of others. I told my young friends who were gathered last Saturday that I was going to share this story as a testimony to this legislation and to what is happening across this country. 
   Madison organized a wonderful charity event, with proceeds going to the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara's pediatric research fund. We all enjoyed a day of story telling, face painting, a silent auction, and this amazing rummage sale in which children and their families brought used toys to share with other children and their families and raise money in the process, and that money all going to raise awareness for pediatric cancer. I can think of nothing more powerful than the sight of children advocating on behalf of other children. 
   I know our colleague from Ohio in these past 9 years has spearheaded a number of community events around the country actually and in this city to raise awareness for childhood cancer and to raise the necessary funds to be added to the funds, which our legislation will hopefully make possible for pediatric cancer. 
   So whether it's through community organizing or comprehensive legislation, we are all working together in this country to fight pediatric cancer. 
   I am honored and proud to be a part of this effort, particularly on this day, to honor my colleague and friend as well because of the dedication she has provided for this House in leading us to this point. 
   I thank the leadership of our committee that has brought us to this point as well and the work that we will do with our colleagues to make sure this legislation is passed and signed into law.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our troops, and in support of a responsible U.S. policy in Iraq. 
   I have opposed the Iraq war from the very beginning. 
   Over 5 years later, this war has taken the lives of more than 4,000 of our brave troops. 
   Our armed forces are incredibly strained, and our nation's image tarnished in the wake of this foreign relations disaster. 
   I have opposed continued funding of this war in the past, and I will vote against Amendment No. 1, which gives the President another blank check. 
   Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 of this bill, however, are a marked and deliberate shift away from the failed and short-sighted policies of President Bush. 
   And No. 2 requires that all troops be fully trained and equipped before deployment, and calls for a redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to begin in 30 days. 
   It also bans any permanent U.S. bases in Iraq and codifies contracting fraud as a criminal offense. 
   Amendment No. 3 will restore the education benefits under the GI bill to include a full, 4-year college education for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 
   Mr. Speaker, this war has taken an incredible toll on American troops, their families, and our entire country. 
   We cannot turn back the hands of time, but we can move forward to bring our troops home, end this war, and provide them with the tools they will need to continue their education. 
   As this New Direction Congress has done time and again, today we will tell the President that he is wrong. 
   Let us truly support the troops and vote to bring them home.

   Last night, the House passed this resolution overwhelmingly. Since 1994, nearly 500,000 AmeriCorps have served with thousands of nonprofits, public agencies and faith-based organizations across America. 
   Through AmeriCorps, these individuals dedicate their time and energy in a variety of areas to help meet the needs of local communities. In my home State of California alone, more than 7,900 people this year will participate in one of more than 7,500 AmeriCorps programs throughout the State. One such program is coordinated by the Santa Barbara County Education Office in my district. This program provides daily tutoring and reading for over 700 at-risk students, recruits volunteers for additional educational programs, and works to increase disaster preparedness in the schools in the county. 
   The 62.4 million hours served by AmeriCorps members have bettered the communities and touched the lives of countless Americans. This is the U.S.A. at its best. To all these incredible AmeriCorps members, I commend you and thank you for your service.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, in 2002, the House passed the No Child Left Behind Act, the biggest Federal overhaul of our public school system in decades. Now, 5 years later, the Congress has an opportunity to reevaluate the law and address what doesn't seem to be working. 
   During last week's Memorial Day district work period, I met with teachers, parents and school administrators to listen to their thoughts on NCLB. I wanted to hear from the people who are in our classrooms every day. They have seen firsthand the success and failures of the law over the last 5 years. 
   The most important thing I heard is that there isn't a single teacher, parent or administrator opposed to accountability, but they sure had a lot to say about how we measure it. I learned that, regardless of a school's status, everyone had similar concerns with the accountability measures and assessment of subgroups by the law. 
   Hearing firsthand about the implications of NCLB through my classrooms visits and meetings with parents, teachers and school administrators was a powerful and instructive experience. As we continue the process of reauthorizing NCLB, I encourage us all to visit schools, talk to teachers, see for ourselves how this law is affecting our public schools. A little more time in the classroom is good for us all.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. But then again, you already know that because I have stood on this floor countless times in the past few years expressing this same sentiment. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to again pass a bill that would direct federally funded, ethical stem cell research and fulfill a promise to the overwhelming majority of Americans who support it. 
   Fortunately, my State of California has stepped up to the plate and dedicated $3 billion to embryonic stem cell research. But this is only the first step. Because the only way to make true progress is through coordinated research conducted on a national level. In the meantime, we sit and watch as scientists throughout Europe and the rest of the world make breakthroughs that the United States cannot as long as our researchers' hands are tied. 
   What amazes me most about this debate today is the rhetoric used by the opposition about using Federal money to create and destroy embryos. But then again, that is just what the opponents want you to believe, when, in fact, it is just plain untrue. 
   As we have discussed many times before, this bill explicitly mandates that Federal funds only be used to conduct research on stem cells already extracted from embryos created by in vitro fertilization which would have been discarded anyway because the donors no longer need or want them. 
   Please vote today in favor of this bill that will give hope to millions of Americans, including the loved ones of everyone in this body. My own family members suffer from diseases that may be cured through embryonic stem cell research. There is really nothing else left to say other than please don't let these people down. Don't tell them that the potential for cures for their diseases are not important enough. 
   Finally, I want to commend my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) and the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), and all of the people who have worked so tirelessly to bring this sound, bipartisan legislation here before us today.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I voice my deep disappointment with the recent Supreme Court decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tires. 
   Women, on average, are paid less than their male counterparts. For women of color, the pay is much less. Unless you can look me in the eye and say that women are less intelligent, less capable than their male counterparts in the same fields, the most glaring explanation for this discrepancy is discrimination. 
   We have made great strides in working to equalize wages for all Americans regardless of gender, race or age. But the decision last week to limit a worker's available recourse in the face of discrimination is a setback to all of our civil rights, and reminds us of how far we still have to go. 
   Now we must mobilize. To fix this disparity, we must move forward and correct the law so this misinterpretation will never occur again. I urge my colleagues to support a legislative remedy to preserve a worker's right to be compensated for discrimination.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   I rise in very strong opposition to both amendments by my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) which eliminate current protections for sensitive, coastal marine areas for new offshore drill for oil and gas. 
   Under these amendments, we could literally see the push for new drilling off our coast begin almost immediately. Though oil and gas companies awash in profits from our open constituents profits would have us believe that all the offshore resources are off limits today, that we are only talking about drilling for natural gas and not oil, and also that today's high gas prices demand this new drilling, these arguments don't hold up under scrutiny. 
   First, the industry already has access to the vast majority of natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf, already has access to it. Indeed, according to the Bush administration, about 80 percent of the known reserves are located in areas where this drilling is already allowed. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry already owns the drilling rights to more than 4,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico alone. 
   Second, there is no such thing as natural gas-only drilling. Drilling for gas, natural gas, means drilling for oil. 
   Even the Bush administration and the energy industry have dismissed so-called gas-only drilling as unworkable. This is what the American Association of Petroleum Geologists has to say about gas only drilling. This is a quote, ``There are a lot of times when you drill for oil, and find gas instead--and the other way around. You never know for sure what you're going to find until you're in there.'' 
   Here is another quote from the former head of Minerals Management Service. ``While gas-only leasing sounds appealing, as a practical matter, it may remain difficult to implement in a manner that reflects sound public policy.'' 
   Now, finally, new drilling off our coast is not going to lower gas prices today or any time in the near future. It would take an estimated 7 years for natural gas from new leases to come online, 7 years. Serious energy efficiency measures, and more use of renewables, this would reduce demand and bring down prices much faster. 
   Mr. Chairman, President Bush has promised to end our oil addiction. Yet, energy prices and industry profits are at record highs. The predictable result of a strategy of focusing on supply and ignoring demand. The Peterson amendment to drill within miles off Florida, California and other coastal States is just more of the same. With 3 percent of the world's resources, 25 percent of the world's demand, it should be obvious there is no way we are going to drill our way out of this problem. 
   We need to use energy in smarter ways to improve fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks, invest more of the development of new, cleaner technology. In doing so, we would be generating way more jobs, the kinds of jobs and growth that will ensure our continued preeminence in among the world's economies. Let us not sacrifice our most important treasures, our coastal economies, in a hopeless way to drill our way to energy security. It doesn't work. 
   I urge all my colleagues to protect our coasts by defeating both Peterson amendments.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to these amendments which eliminate, and I think we heard it clearly, eliminate the long-standing bipartisan moratorium that currently protects the Nation's most sensitive coastal and marine areas from new drilling. 
   I support the current ban not just because I think our coasts are beautiful, and they are, and not just because I believe our coasts provide valuable environmental habitat, and they do, I support the ban because I know our coastlines are the economic engines of our communities and that is being threatened by new drilling. 
   The people in these communities, I represent them. I know the value of their coastlines, and that is why they are so against new drilling in these areas. These amendments would mean drilling within 3 miles of the beaches of Florida, California, North Carolina, and other coastal States. It also means drilling where there isn't a whole lot of oil and gas, and where tens of millions of our citizens have made it clear they don't want more drilling. 
   Mr. Chairman, the congressional moratoria has been in place for 26 years and reaffirmed by Presidents George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush, and every Congress since 1992. State officials have also endorsed the moratoria, including Republican Governors Charlie Crist and Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
   These actions have all been met with widespread acclaim by a public that knows how valuable, environmentally and economically, our coastlines are. I represent a district with over 20 oil and gas platforms off its coastline. I know that drilling has serious consequences for the environment. I see it every day. 
   I know that drilling generates huge amounts of waste, and significant levels of air and water pollution. These pollutants are a real threat to our public health. 
   These amendments are just a continuation of the backward thinking energy policies that have gotten us here in the first place. Last year, 279 Members of Congress voted to protect the Outer Continental Shelf moratorium when we defeated a similar amendment to push for drilling off our coast. 
   Votes against these amendments are the same thing: A vote to protect our coasts and a statement for new thinking on energy. And so I urge my colleagues with all the strength that I have to oppose these amendments and keep our coastline pristine, the economic engines that they are, and a stewardship we will pass on to our children and grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. Today, our economy relies on fossil fuels for energy. We must simply change that. 
   President Bush admits we are addicted to oil, and this addiction is harming our country. The best way to beat this addiction is to stop using so much oil and gas by reducing demand, promoting renewables, and developing alternatives. 
   Since America is not exactly awash in oil and gas, reducing our dependence upon them would be good not only for our environment but for the economy and our national security as well. 
   To be honest, though, we have to do more than just talk about the potential that renewables and alternative energy has for this country. We have to put in place more funding for programs to bring these energy sources to market. We have to make changes in energy policy to encourage their use. And that is exactly what H.R. 6 does. 
   In the debate on the floor today, the minority side has described H.R. 6 as a takings. So let me remind all of us that when the House considered and passed the Jindal-Pombo OCS drilling legislation last June, 2006, no Republican Member challenged the conservation fee as a breach of contract or a taking. In fact, the Committee on Resources report on that legislation, H.R. 4761, states, and I quote, ``this new fee addresses the mistakes made in leases issued in 1998 and 1999 where price triggers for royalties were not included in the lease without violating contractual obligations of the United States.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans want real meaningful solutions to our Nation's energy challenges. Big Oil has received more than its fair share of handouts. It is time we put taxpayer funds to more productive use. Let us pass the CLEAN Energy Act.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the National Landscape Conservation System Act. This bill will help protect some of our Nation's most treasured landscapes. I want to commend my chairmen, both Mr. Grijalva, the subcommittee chairman from Arizona; and Mr. Rahall, the full committee chairman, for bringing this important legislation to the floor today. 
   The NLCS was created administratively in 2000 to guide the management of the national monuments, wilderness areas, and other significant public lands under the Bureau of Land Management's authority. Many of these lands, like the Carrizo Plain National Monument and California Coastal Monument in my congressional district, are on par with our national parks in their beauty and value to the American people. 
   Unfortunately, the system has taken a back seat in our country's land conservation efforts. It's been shortchanged in funding in the President's budget year after year. There are not enough resources or staff to properly manage these lands. And reports continue to surface that the natural, cultural, and archeological sites on NLCS lands are being overrun or destroyed. 
   Today we can take the first step in improving the stewardship of these lands by passing H.R. 2016. This is a straightforward bill. It simply writes the NLCS into law. I want to stress to my colleagues this bill does not change how any of the units in the system are presently managed. Grazing rights, water rights, and public access to the areas are unchanged. The bill does, however, recognize that these landscapes are of great significance to the American people and should be managed to protect their values. Over the coming decades, these lands will become more widely used, and we must be prepared to handle that increase. 
   Finally, we have other areas that should be part of NLCS, and I hope they are, places like the Piedras Blancas Light Station in any district. I hope this will special place as one example, a place on California's central coast, will be soon be added to the system through legislation I have already introduced. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is a logical and needed next step toward improving the management of the units that make up the NLCS. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2016.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution supporting our troops and disapproving the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. 
   More than 4 years ago, the resolution to support a war in Iraq came before this House. After careful consideration of the evidence and arguments put forth for a unilateral preemptive attack on Iraq, I decided I could not in good conscience vote for that resolution. 
   My ``no'' vote against the President's plan for war in Iraq is one of my proudest moments in Congress. I didn't believe the case where war had been made. There was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The administration's arguments about al Qaeda connections with Iraq were specious, and its attempt to link Iraq with the tragedy of 9/11 was shameful. 
   I was deeply concerned about the effects of preemptive war on America's standing in the world, and equally worried about the ramifications for the greater Middle East, a region of great importance and even greater fragility. And I had strong concerns about the administration's preparation for the aftermath of a war in Iraq. The administration was completely focused on waging war and not on winning the peace. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, all of those concerns have been borne out. There were no WMDs, no al Qaeda connections, no 9/11 link. It was all trumped up evidence by an administration consumed with toppling the dictator in Iraq. Today, Iraq is in civil war, the Middle East is even more unsettled, and our standing in the world is at a low point. The international support given to America after 9/11 was squandered and will take years to repair the damage. And, as a Nation, we are even less secure today than we were the day we invaded Iraq. I point this out only because it is critically important to know where we have been if we want to know where we should be going. 
   This resolution gives voice to the deep, deep opposition here in the Congress and throughout the country to the President's plan for escalating the war in Iraq.     
   I speak for the vast majority of my constituents on the central coast of California when I state my unequivocal opposition to this escalation. The administration's plan looks like more of the same failed policies that got us here in the first place. It is a plan based more on hope than on fact, buttressed by hysterical rhetoric. It is a plan opposed by numerous military leaders and experts. It is, quite frankly, simply not believable. 
   The recent National Intelligence Estimate makes it perfectly clear that the President's grand plan is just never going to work. The resolution here before us puts Congress on record against the proposition that success will come only after more troops are thrown into battle. 
   The other objective of this resolution is to remind everyone that opposing the war in Iraq, and especially opposing the President's escalation, is consistent with supporting our troops. Our men and women in uniform have done everything we have asked them to do and so much more. Over 3,000 have made the ultimate sacrifice. More than 20,000 others have been injured, so very many of them seriously. 
   Let no one doubt the bravery of our troops and the support that I and my colleagues who are opposed to this war have for them. I am eternally grateful for the sacrifices our men and women in uniform and their families are willing to make every single day. They continue the long distinguished line of soldiers, sailors and airmen that have kept our country and so many others free from tyranny and oppression, but their service is due more than heartfelt appreciation and flowery words from politicians.  
   Their sacrifice, their service, is owed responsible leadership from those civilian leaders with whom power ultimately rests, and that is where our soldiers have been let down. This administration has taken arrogance, stubbornness and incompetence to new heights. It ignored the advice of military experts leading up to and throughout this war. 
   It stocked reconstruction teams with political hacks, and it brushed off the indisputable reality of Iraq in a meltdown. It dismissed the considered opinion of the Iraq Study Group, the Congress, most importantly, the American people. 
   Make no mistake, the failure of the war in Iraq lies at the highest levels of the White House and at the desks of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, and the cost of that failure is borne by our troops, their families and the Iraqi people. It is time for the administration to stop obfuscating the conditions on the ground in Iraq, stop the charade about so-called new plans that will finally bring success in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time to stop the war in Iraq. Support the troops. Indeed, bring them home.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this bipartisan resolution to continue that good work of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. As a member of the commission, I want to thank our cochairs, Representatives DAVID PRICE and DAVID DREIER, for the excellent job that they have done in leading us. 
   I want to thank our current and former staff, John Lis, Tommy Ross, Lara Alameh and Robert Lawrence, who have worked very hard to make the commission successful with its work. 
   Madam Speaker, the House Democracy Assistance Commission was established in the last Congress as an instrument for this House to share some of  the lessons we have learned over 200 years about making democratic government work. 
   The commission has tried to impart these lessons to countries around the world now embarking on this hopeful path. Members of the commission have visited a number of countries struggling to find their way in a more open system of government, eager to have our partnership with them in this endeavor. We have hosted representatives from many of these same countries here in Washington and in some of our congressional districts. 
   For example, I hosted members of the Indonesian delegation in my district, and I have traveled there, and to East Timor, to Macedonia, to Afghanistan. During these visits, we discussed with our counterparts the basic workings of government, everything from the importance of constituent relations to the value of setting budgets, from the roles of minority and majority parties to the importance of public health programs.     
   We don't tell them how they should make their governments work, but we do try to explain how we have made it work in this country; and we have done so in a bipartisan and really even nonpartisan manner. 
   Madam Speaker, this year the House will have before it many important tasks. I believe very few are as important to the well-being and future of our country as helping to establish stable democracies around the world. The House Democracy Assistance Commission will try in its small way to advance that goal, to bring us a more peaceful and just, well-governed world. 
   I urge the House to pass this legislation and let us continue our work.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (PAYING TRIBUTE TO HONORABLE JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues this evening in honoring the life of our dear friend, JULIA CARSON. And I want to say a word in keeping with the comments by our colleague, our leader, JOHN LARSON from Connecticut, who spoke of the sacredness, really, of this hour that we can spend with one another to lift up the life of a colleague such as JULIA CARSON. 
   JULIA entered Congress the same year as my husband, Walter, in 1996. And the reason I honor this time together is that I have a poignant memory. My husband died suddenly, and my daughter and I found ourselves on the floor here listening to his colleagues, now my colleagues, speak of his life. And it was a tradition that I wasn't familiar with, but it touched me in a way that I know blesses the memory of those who have gone, who have served with us. And in this case, for someone as special as JULIA CARSON, it is a moment that this place becomes what it should be, and is treasured by me. 
   Now, this Member of Congress became my colleague, JULIA CARSON, when I joined Congress in 1998. One of the first events I attended as a Member was an event held by domestic violence advocates, a coalition, a national coalition of the kind of grassroots organizations that I know JULIA CARSON represented in Indianapolis, but I also, in my previous life as a nurse in my community, knew very well at the community level. I wasn't as experienced when I came to Congress as JULIA was when she did. And I listened to her. We were kind of lined up, Members of Congress, to address this coalition on domestic violence. I could speak from my professional experience. But she spoke before me. And she dazzled that crowd because she spoke as a survivor and as someone who had experienced every single thing that they themselves were here in this Capitol to represent on behalf of our community. She had broken the barriers that have entrapped so many Americans of color, Americans who are women. She knew how to fight for herself, for her children as a single mother, as a community member who knew what ceilings were like with class, gender, ethnicity, race, and she could relate that to people. 
   On that day that I listened to JULIA as a brand new Member, I knew that I was in a very special crowd if it included someone like JULIA CARSON. She knew how to take her experiences and become such a role model and strong advocate; civil rights, victims of domestic violence. She improved the lives of countless individuals, and she did so by fixing things that were broken, but also by inspiring people to not give up. 
   And then, as we moved along and as has been referenced, her style and her elegance, I used to love to see her here and to see her bearing and to see her fitting the word ``queen'' in every sense of that word. What a delight to serve with JULIA CARSON. And we saw her, as her illness began to show its effects on her body, never on her spirit, never on her soul, never once dampened her smile, her dazzling beautiful smile. And when I would see her moving slowly, and then with assistance, even in a wheelchair, to come and move about, she never gave an indication of weakness or that she was down. She was always up and inspiring me when I would see her. I wanted to spend time with her. 
   This was a tough time for her. She never let us know it. She kept fighting for all of the issues she cared so much about. And now I want to just close by saying, you know, JULIA, we owe you to continue the legacy that you began. 
   I think of JULIA's suffering with lung cancer. And I think about the fact that three of her colleagues, four, now, of our colleagues this year have died of cancer from this place. And JULIA, I make a pledge to you and to the others that we need to not rest. We need to follow your courage and your endurance and not rest until we do something about this dreaded disease, and do something here, and do it in your memory, and do some other things in your memory as well. And so, I make that pledge to you, JULIA. 
   And I also join my colleagues in remembering you forever for your wit, your elegance, your perseverance, and of course always, JULIA, your smile. I will always love you and treasure your memory.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today the House will be voting on the Energy Independence and Security Act. With this legislation, the new Democratic Congress is leading America in a new direction on energy policy, the most significant energy bill in a generation. We are taking a major step toward ending our dependence on foreign oil by increasing efficiency standards for cars and trucks for the first time in 30 years. This will reduce America's need for oil by 1.1 million gallons per day, cut millions of tons of global warming pollution, and save families up to $1,000 every year. 
   The bill implements landmark energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, which will save American families and businesses billions of dollars in unnecessary energy costs. Finally, the bill boosts the production of environmentally protective home-grown biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. 
   We can and we will do more: promote solar, wind and other renewable energy sources, for example. But this legislation finally begins to address high gas prices, America's oil addiction and the global warming crisis. It will help create hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy technologies. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a new direction of energy. Vote for H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of this legislation. The oil and gas companies, awash in profits, would have us believe they have nowhere to drill. That's just plain wrong. It is the Bush administration which acknowledges that 80 percent of our oil and gas reserves are in areas where drilling is already allowed. The industry is sitting on nearly 70 million acres of public lands where it could be drilling, but isn't. The oil and gas industry already owns drilling rights to more than 6,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   If the industry is so eager to produce more oil and gas, it should get to it. We don't need to open more lands to drilling, when industry is dragging its feet on producing where it already could. 
   Mr. Speaker, this recent push by President Bush and Senator McCain to open up the rest of our coast to offshore drilling is a ruse. It's not about lowering gas prices today, or even in the future. 
   In response to the previous statement, yesterday Guy Caruso, head of the Bush administration's Energy Information Agency, said the following about the impact of new drilling, and I quote, ``It would be a relatively small effect because it would take such a long time to bring those supplies on. It doesn't affect prices that much.'' 
   This push for new coastal drilling is really just a last-ditch effort to get rid of barriers to drilling everywhere before the Bush administration leaves office. It's an attempt for favored special interest to oil companies to get one more favor from its friends. And the high gas prices Americans are now paying offers the perfect cover. 
   I urge my colleagues to call this industry's bluff. If Big Oil wants to drill on public lands, it can do so now. Please vote for this legislation that tells the industry to use it or lose it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise in response to recent calls for new offshore drilling. These arguments for new drilling hit a dry hole for several reasons. 
   First, we are already drilling offshore. Eighty percent of the known offshore reserves are in areas where leasing and drilling is allowed. Today, the oil companies have nearly 6,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico alone. 
   Second, with 3 percent of the world's resources and 25 percent of the world's demand, there is no way we are going to just drill our way out of this problem. 
   Third, even the Bush administration admits consumers would see little savings at the pump from new drilling. 
   Yesterday, Guy Caruso, head of the Energy Information Agency, said this about the impact of new drilling: ``It would be a relatively small effect, because it would take such a long time to bring those supplies on. It doesn't affect prices that much.'' 
   Democrats have a better plan. Let's pass legislation that moves America in a new direction on energy by closing the Enron loophole on Wall Street speculators who are driving up prices. Let's reduce mass transit fares and build the infrastructure there, and let's force Big Oil to use it or lose it on drilling permits. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in bringing America to a new, more affordable energy future.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FLAME Act. I thank Chairman Rahall for yielding me time and for bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
   This bill comes at such a critical time. Our Nation is now and will continue to face longer and more intense fire seasons due to global warming and drought. 
   The cost of fighting fires has grown enormously in recent years, and projections indicate that this trend will only increase, especially in populated wildland urban interface areas. 
   The Forest Service has spent over $1 billion per year on 5 of the last 7 years to extinguish fires. And wildland fire management activities are estimated to consume close to half of the Forest Service's budget this year. These escalating costs are having a significant impact on the Forest Service. For example, the Forest Service is forced to pull funds from other programs, leaving fewer funds available for camp ground maintenance and forest restoration. 
   The emergency fund created by the FLAME Act will reduce the need to deplete important Forest Service programs and will provide more reliable funding than uncertain year-to-year supplementals. Even more important, the FLAME Act will ensure the Forest Service has regular funding available for day-to-day fire management. This includes such important prevention steps, like FIREWISE Communities, hazardous fuels treatment, and restoration work. 
   It's absolutely essential that our efforts to fight today's fires don't hurt our efforts to prevent tomorrow's fires. This bill will ensure this is the case. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Zaca Fire that burned 240,000 acres in my congressional district last year cost the Forest Service $120 million. That's one fire alone. With more than 1,700 fires in California this year already and the fire season is not even half over, it's pretty clear we're going to have to create an emergency Federal fund dedicated solely to devastating wildland fires. 
   This idea is long overdue, and this legislation deserves to be approved by the House. So I urge all of my colleagues to address the long-term wildfire suppression funding situation by supporting the FLAME Act.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my committee chairman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a representative of areas affected by the recent wildfires and as a cosponsor of House Resolution 1322, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I thank my colleague and my neighboring Member of Congress, Congressman Farr, for introducing this resolution. 
   In the last 3 weeks, more than 1,700 wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres in our home State of California. In my district alone, the Gap Fire, one of the State's highest priorities now, has burned nearly 10,000 acres and threatened several hundred homes in the city of Goleta. Yet, despite high winds and temperatures, our incredible firefighters and emergency personnel have limited the destruction, have saved hundreds of homes, hundreds of lives. 
   I am so proud to say that California's emergency preparedness system and procedures are among the best in the Nation. My constituents in Goleta are the most recent beneficiaries of this system. I have to admit that I am a little biased toward our firefighters as well. Years ago, as a school nurse, they taught me CPR, they taught me first aid, they helped me train our school personnel. They are a wonderful asset to safety and preparedness in our communities. 
   From their base at Dos Pueblos High School, State and local officials have worked together to move resources from across the State to areas that needed them most. They're masters at doing this. If not for this organized and swift effort, many more acres, homes, and lives could have been lost. 
   As we speak here today on the floor of this House, in this well, thousands of men and women are putting their lives on the line, enduring great hardships to protect our wildlife, our property; indeed, our lives. Today, we commend these amazing individuals and we express our gratitude at their sacrifice and their service. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Farr, to join all of us in thanking and honoring these courageous individuals by supporting this legislation.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the National Day of Silence. On April 25, hundreds of thousands of students around our country will observe a day of silence in memory of Lawrence King. Lawrence was a 15-year-old attending E.O. Greene Junior High in Oxnard, California, my district. He liked to draw, study bugs, crochet, and sing. 
   He was also repeatedly harassed in school because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. He endured anti-gay taunts, slurs, and other forms of bullying. This harassment culminated in his death when on February 1, 2008, he was shot in the head by his 14-year-old classmate. 
   Larry's death is incredibly tragic. It is also a sad reminder that pleas for help from our young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population are often met with silence. 
   I commend the courage of every student participating in the Day of Silence. I know that their efforts will bring much-needed attention to the plight that students like Larry face every single day.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, with great sadness, rise to pay tribute as well to our dear colleague, Jo Ann Davis. 
   As other women in the Congress know, there is a sisterhood among many women Members. This weekend, we lost one of our sisters to a disease that has fostered another kind of sisterhood throughout the Nation, breast cancer. And while Jo Ann would have chosen to confront her disease in private, she bravely and valiantly decided  to take her experience to improve the experiences of other women in that sisterhood. She did so by advocating for the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act and other legislation that would improve the lives of those who suffer from this disease. 
   I was also proud to work with Jo Ann on the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act. Together we worked, one from the west coast and one from the east, to extend to Federal firefighters the same presumptive disability rights offered to most city and State firefighters. I enjoyed working with Jo Ann on this issue, especially as she showed so much her dedication to firefighters and their families. 
   I will, however, most fondly remember the many mornings I and several others spent with Jo Ann at prayer breakfast on Wednesday mornings at the C Street House, as we will gather in sadness and sorrow tomorrow. 
   We were bound together, several of us, through personal experiences with cancer. And when amongst our fellowship Jo Ann was first diagnosed, we supported her with prayer; and then as she regained her strength, we rejoiced. But as so often and tragically happens with this dreaded disease and others, there was a relapse. And we have been much in prayer, as all of us have, for her recovery, but it was not to be. 
   You know, she and I had our differences in the direction of policy, but we certainly shared in our desire to let our faith serve as a guide for our work in Congress. And she was a very strong, principled person whose convictions and certainty of her faith shown through everything that she did. 
   I know we're going to honor our dear departed colleague by following in her strong example, by calling on our faith to serve as the motivation for our work here in Congress the way that she did. We may not measure up to her strength, but we have a role model in her. And I also hope that we, as a Congress, will serve to honor her memory by redoubling our efforts to remove the scourge of cancer through support for prevention, for following her example of reaching out, through education outreach and awareness, and for increasing research dollars so that we can more effectively prevent and treat this disease. 
   I join my colleagues in paying tribute to Jo Ann Davis today and offering our condolences to her family, her staff and her constituents in this time of their sorrow. We will miss Jo Ann Davis dearly.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise again in reluctant support of this legislation. 
   I spoke earlier this week about the necessity for the underlying economic rescue legislation and I stand by that statement. If anything, the events of the last week have demonstrated that point even more vividly. 
   The credit crisis that is gripping America is choking Main Street and affecting Americans of all walks of life. Businesses, small and large alike, are finding it more and more difficult to get credit to run their businesses. This slowdown is costing American jobs. Just today the administration announced that another 159,000 jobs were lost in September, the largest monthly loss in more than 5 years. That means we've lost nearly 800,000 jobs in the first 9 months of this year. 
   I share my constituents' deep anger over this situation created by the greed of lenders and Wall Street players, the inattentiveness of Federal regulators, and the overall failure of the Bush administration's policies. We must act quickly and this proposal to meet this crisis is the best option we have. I know it would be much easier for me to take the easier, more popular route and vote against this measure, but I believe that would be the wrong choice for my district and my country for all the reasons I laid out earlier in the week.  
   This legislation adds a number of provisions to the economic rescue package the House considered on Monday, most of which are unrelated to the financial crisis. I support many of them and oppose others. 
   First, the bill temporarily raises deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 in federally insured banks and credit unions. This is a good step to increase confidence in our banking system and a long overdue update to this critical protection for the assets of millions of American families and small businesses. 
   Second, the bill protects some 22 million taxpayers from the effect of the Alternative Minimum Tax. This is a tax provision intended to keep the wealthiest in our society from avoiding all income taxes but, because it hasn't been updated in decades, now threatens to ensnare millions of middle income taxpayers with higher taxes. I hope that in the next Congress we can permanently fix this increasingly difficult problem but we must at least stave off its ill effects for this year. 
   Third, the bill includes critically important mental health parity legislation. It would require insurance companies to treat coverage of mental health services the same as other medical services. As a public health nurse, I know there should be no distinction in the necessity of treating heart disease, bone disease, or mental health disease. I have long supported this effort to destigmatize mental health and ensure that Americans suffering from mental health problems can receive treatment. This is an extremely positive step forward for health care in America. 
   Fourth, the bill extends Federal support for the development of wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources. I have been arguing for a 5-10 year extension of these provisions to encourage the development of alternative energy so we can finally break our crippling addiction to fossil fuels. Establishing a long term investment horizon for these efforts is critical to making that work. These extensions should be for longer than the 1-3 years included in this bill but they cannot be allowed to expire, which most would do by the end of this year. 
   Unfortunately, included in these energy tax provisions is support for so-called clean coal production and shale oil extraction. The oil and gas industry could not possibly be more profitable and needs more taxpayer support like Warren Buffett needs investment advice. In addition, both the oil and coal industries already received overly generous taxpayer subsidies in the Republican's 2005 energy bill. I do not support these provisions and believe they should be removed or repealed in the next Congress. 
   Also, much of the cost of these energy tax breaks are not offset so they will increase the already huge Bush deficits. In an effort to reinstate fiscal discipline, House Democrats have consistently voted to pay for these alternative energy production tax breaks by closing corporate loopholes and other measures. It's a shame the Senate cannot follow suit and we are faced with a take-it or leave-it choice on continuing these important alternative energy provisions. 
   Finally, I am very concerned about the inclusion of language giving the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, the go-ahead to alter or suspend so-called ``mark to market'' accounting principles. The SEC just issued what it calls ``clarifications'' on these rules at the behest of the financial services industry and I believe this could be a big mistake. Investors simply must be able to trust that a company's financial statements give a clear and accurate portrait of the health of the company and ``mark to market'' is part of ensuring that is the case. I understand that today's market conditions make establishing prices for securities difficult, but we have to be careful that we don't enable the kind of opaque accounting that has led to numerous financial debacles in recent years. 
   Despite my concerns about these provisions, I still believe it is in the best interests of the country to pass this legislation.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1022. 
   I was proud introduce this resolution with my colleague and Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, Cathy McMorris Rodgers. 
   And I am equally proud that 122 Members of the House joined in cosponsoring H. Res. 1022, including almost every single woman Member of the House and our esteemed Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
   Last fall, I was fortunate to lead a delegation of women Members to a conference entitled ``Women Deliver.'' 
   This conference brought together nearly 2000 participants from around the world, including parliamentarians, diplomats, health professionals, patients and activists. 
   We joined there and resolved to make a greater investment in women in order to improve maternal health. 
   No woman should have to die giving life and I was proud to see individuals from every background--ethnically, culturally, religiously, and from all income levels--agree that we must deliver for women by ensuring that they can safely deliver. 
   The 500,000 maternal deaths that occur annually are largely preventable. 
   We know that through family planning, making emergency care more widely available, and increasing the number of skilled health professionals who can attend to births we can combat the epidemic of maternal death both at home and abroad. 
   After all, the United States is not immune to maternal death and we experience the highest rate of maternal mortality than all other industrialized nations. 
   As we close out the month of May, when we celebrated Mother's Day, let's join in making a  stronger commitment to improving maternal health.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (GOLETA WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3323, the Goleta Water Distribution System Conveyance Act of 2007--a bill I introduced last year that would authorize the title transfer of a federally owned water distribution system in my congressional district from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Goleta Water District. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. RAHALL, and chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, Ms. NAPOLITANO, as well as the ranking members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for bringing H.R. 3323 before us today. 
   The purpose of the legislation is to simplify the operation and maintenance of the District's water distribution system and eliminate unnecessary paperwork and consultation between the District and the Bureau. 
   The Goleta Water District has operated and maintained the facilities proposed for transfer since the 1950s. They have worked through all requirements of the Bureau's title transfer process, including public meetings, fulfillment of their repayment obligations, completion of an environmental assessment, and compliance with all other applicable laws. 
   The only step remaining to complete the process is an act of Congress enabling the Secretary of the Interior to transfer title. 
   It is important to note that the proposed transfer would apply only to lands and facilities associated with the District and would not affect the District's existing water service contract with the Santa Barbara County Water Agency nor the Federal government receipts from water deliveries under the contract. In addition, the proposed transfer does not envision any new physical modification or expansion of the service infrastructure. 
   I'm pleased the administration is supporting my legislation, which will allow the Bureau to focus its limited resources where they are needed most. In my view, this is an example of local problem-solving at its best. I commend the staff of the water district and the Bureau for their efforts to reach this agreement. I know that they have been working on this for several years now. 
   Again, I would like to thank the Natural Resources Committee for supporting this bill, and urge its immediate passage.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   At the heart of this bill is the fact that there exists an unreasonable difference in the way society treats mental health conditions as opposed to all other health conditions. There are quite a few health professionals in Congress, and to all of us there is no distinction in the necessity of treating heart disease, bone disease, or mental health disease. They are all equally vital to our body's functioning, and that is our goal in this act. 
   We must finally put an end to the discrimination being practiced by insurers and others when they offer health coverage for some health conditions and not others. It's not fair to say we'll cover some parts of your health care, but we'll pick and choose which parts of your body to cover. That's bad for business. I know it's bad for health care. 
   I commend PATRICK KENNEDY and JIM RAMSTAD for their tireless work on this bill and seeing its coming to the floor. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Cardoza-Ross-Reyes Amendment to H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. 
   This amendment will provide a 5 year grace period for homeowners who are required to purchase flood insurance as a result of new flood maps that decertify previously certified levees. During this period, homeowners would be entitled to a 50 percent reduction in their flood insurance premium while the levees are being recertified. 
   Recently, while updating flood maps in my congressional district, FEMA asked the Army Corps of Engineers to certify that the Santa Maria Valley levees would protect the City of Santa Maria for the next 100 years. Without the Corps' certification, much of the community will be placed in a flood zone and many of my constituents will be required to purchase expensive Federal flood insurance, something that many of them cannot afford. 
   The Cardoza-Ross-Reyes Amendment addresses this problem. 
   Since the Army Corps of Engineers completed the 26-mile Santa Maria Valley levees in 1963, the City has prospered, becoming the largest in Santa Barbara County. However, I over the years, natural deterioration of the levees has undermined their strength, leaving the community vulnerable to potentially devastating flooding by the Santa Maria River. 
   I am working with the City of Santa Maria, Santa Barbara County, and the area's other elected officials to restore the levees so they can be certified by the Army Corps of Engineers and, more importantly, so our community can avoid a catastrophic flooding event. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is extremely important to my constituents. It will provide them with much needed relief in a potentially expensive time. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the Cardoza-Ross-Reyes Amendment.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, last week I was fortunate to visit Mexico City as a part of a bipartisan trip organized by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Our trip provided an excellent opportunity for my colleagues and me to meet with prominent Mexican leaders in business, journalism and government. 
   It also provided a forum to discuss ongoing political and economic changes in Mexico and ways in which we can improve the relationship between the United States and Mexico. We discussed civic and political life in both countries, how we can work more closely with Mexican partner institutions to help bring about a more open, competitive and equitable society. One example is the security issues we both face, one which we share. 
   Madam Speaker, our relationship with our friend and neighbor Mexico is critically important. It cries out for more cooperation and engagement. 
   I want to thank the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars and its Mexico institute for facilitating this important dialogue. I know I was better able to get a picture of the state of democracy in Mexico, the shared goals and challenges that confront both of our countries, how we can be better neighbors to one another. 
   So I hope we can continue this important conversation and build a better future for the United States and for Mexico.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise in very reluctant support of this bipartisan effort to address our nation's economic crisis. 
   I do so because the very core of our American economy is at risk and we must act now in order to prevent its collapse. This is the diagnosis presented to us by Treasury Secretary Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and countless economists. In my own survey of the finance and banking world, I have heard the same analysis of our current predicament and the need for Congress to act quickly. 
   What we face here is an economic meltdown brought on by a housing bubble, fueled in part by the subprime mortgage scandals, and made possible by the lack of regulatory oversight by the Bush Administration. Wall Street now sits on billions of dollars of mortgages it cannot price and it cannot sell. The response to this uncertainty has been a near freeze of credit markets, increasing unemployment and a slowing of our economy. Already, car, home, student and business loans are drying up across the economy and should this continue--or get worse--the markets would likely drop precipitously and the economy would come to a standstill or worse. 
   Obviously, my concern is not with the effect on large financial institutions. They got themselves into this mess and if we could just turn our head while they failed that would be fine with me. My concern is how this economic calamity would affect ordinary Americans. And here the prediction is truly dire. 
   If the Secretary is correct, lending would come to a near halt. That means it would be much, much more difficult--and expensive--to obtain loans to buy a car, a home or to run a business. Small, medium and large businesses alike would begin layoffs because the ability to obtain a loan is such a critical part of running a business today, much less growing a business. We have already seen over job losses of over 600,000 people in the U.S. this year. The unemployment rate in California has increased to 7.7 percent, the highest in over 12 years and up from 5.5 percent only 12 months ago. 
   Foreclosures would continue unabated. So far this year, over half a million foreclosures have been filed in California, and the state is on pace to see more than 841,000 foreclosure filings this year. Eight of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates in the nation are in California. As bad as those foreclosures are for the people losing their homes, they also contribute to the downward pressure on home values for other properties in the neighborhood, hurting homeowners who are totally innocent in all this. 
   In addition, more innocent and hardworking Americans could see their life savings sapped, as IRAs and 401Ks lose value in a plummeting stock market. And increased unemployment also means lower tax revenues and greater calls for government assistance, resulting in even more exploding federal deficits. 
   In short, we could be facing a huge recession if we're lucky, a depression if we aren't. This is what our economic leaders tell us is the future we face if we don't act now. 
   I share my constituents' disgust with this situation. The idea that hardworking taxpayers have to put their money at risk to stabilize the economy because of the bad choices, nefarious actions and utter incompetence of Wall Street, its regulators and the Bush Administration is nauseating. But, if Secretary Paulson and the others are correct, the alternative is much worse and a serious threat to every single American. 
   Madame Speaker, the proposal originally offered by President Bush to address this crisis was completely unacceptable. True to form, the President simply asked the Congress to provide him with a blank check, no questions asked. 
   The Administration wanted no oversight--by Congress, the courts or anyone--of how it would spend the money it asked for. It rejected calls to limit CEO pay in companies that would be bailed out by taxpayers. It refused to help the growing number of Americans facing foreclosure and the millions of Americans whose housing values affected by those foreclosures. And it failed to ensure taxpayers would benefit as much as the Wall Street firms getting this federal assistance. 
   The legislation before us today is very much the President's product. But Democrats have made critical improvements. Most importantly, the bill contains mechanisms to ensure taxpayers get their money back by requiring taxpayer ownership stakes in companies that benefit from this rescue plan, so if the companies return to profitability then taxpayers prosper as well. And it sets up insurance collections measures and a potential new tax on the financial services industry after 5 years if repayment of taxpayer rescue funds hasn't occurred. 
   We limit the compensation of top corporate executives whose companies benefit from taxpayer assistance, put a halt to ``golden parachutes,'' and require repayment of bonuses based on company profits that may vanish at a later date. We establish an oversight board and a special inspector general to oversee Secretary Paulson's actions, and require the details of his actions to be posted on the Internet. 
   The bill also should help small business and families that need credit by aiding smaller banks hurt by the mortgage crisis, expanding eligibility for mortgage refinancing help and encouraging loan servicers to make problem loans more affordable. While these steps are helpful to homeowners potentially facing foreclosure, they are critical to innocent families whose home values are plummeting from record foreclosure rates and abandoned, foreclosed properties in their neighborhoods. 
   Finally, while the immediate need is to stabilize the markets and get our economy back on track, we begin the process of reestablishing common sense regulation protecting  consumers and encouraging stability in our markets. Much of this current mess arises from the governing choices of President Bush and his party, especially their undying faith in deregulation and a systematic policy to dismantle vital consumer protections. That has to be reversed. On President Bush's watch we have seen widening income inequality, anemic job creation, skyrocketing energy prices, record federal budget deficits and now a potential historic financial meltdown. This record of failure is clear and we have to turn a page on it. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not an easy vote to cast, but it is necessary for the future stability of our economy and the lives of everyday Americans.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise also in strong suspects of the COPS Improvement Act. 
   Since the COPS program began in 1994, it has provided for the hiring of 404 police officers in my congressional district. It has directed billions of dollars in grants to law enforcement agencies, including more than $20 million to benefit my constituents on the central coast of California. 
   COPS deserves much of the credit for the major drop in crime across our country during the 1990s, but the Bush administration has repeatedly targeted the COPS hiring program for elimination. So I'm glad the new Democratic majority in Congress realizes the  importance of putting cops on the beat. The COPS Improvement Act continues the good work we started in the 1990s. It will help law enforcement agencies in my district to hire another 173 police officers. That's 173 men and women to patrol the streets and keep their hardworking neighbors safe. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge this House to pass this much-needed legislation today.

   Eosinophilic disorders are devastating as patients literally suffer from an attack on their bodies by their own immune systems. They are chronic disorders that have no cure and can even be fatal. Because they are rare, patients often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. 
   And as a nurse, I have seen intimately how heartbreaking it is for a patient and his or her family to go through test after test while suffering all the while from an unidentifiable condition. 
   That is why I support this resolution, calling for greater awareness of eosinophilic disorders and encouraging health care providers to increase education about these diseases. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as well.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, ExxonMobil recently announced that they have earned over $40 billion in 2007, the highest profits ever for a U.S. company. Of course, we want our U.S. companies to succeed in the global marketplace, but hugely profitable oil companies certainly don't need taxpayer subsidies, especially as the price of oil continues to hover at $100 a barrel. 
   I want to urge my colleagues, it was none other than President Bush who said that with oil at $50 a barrel, he saw no need for the kind of subsidies put in the 2005 energy bill by the Republican Congress. My constituents are fed up that oil companies are reaping billions in profits while hardworking Americans are suffering from a slowing economy. 
   Now is the time to level the playing field by removing Big Oil tax breaks and advancing clean technologies that will create green collar jobs and help grow our economy, drive down high energy prices, reduce our dependence on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels, and curb global warming pollution. 
   If we are going to give American consumers more efficient and cheaper energy options, we need to expand the incentives to invest in renewable and alternative energy sources. 
   The House will soon take up legislation to repeal these giveaways and to put our tax dollars to work to create a new policy for the 21st century. This legislation will significantly move us toward the goal of energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 972 which I am proud to have introduced with Congresswomen FALLIN, SCHAKOWSKY, MCMORRIS RODGERS, CHRISTENSEN, and CUBIN. This diverse group of lead sponsors is testament to the importance of raising greater awareness about heart disease, and especially heart disease in women. 
   The resolution recognizes both Heart Month and National Wear Red Day, both of which occur in February. Heart Month was first designated 45 years ago and has served as a launching pad to spur advocates into action around the country. 
   In my hometown of Santa Barbara, there will be a Go Red for Women luncheon in the coming weeks. This event provides opportunities for women to learn more about heart health for themselves and also for the role they often play as the health decisionmaker in their families. 
   The importance of community events like Go Red for Women lunches cannot be overstated. Heart disease is the number one killer of both women and men. But now, in fact, more women than men die of heart disease each year. Unfortunately, there is still an existing knowledge gap both in terms of public awareness and professional awareness. 
   Despite the fact that almost 460,000 American women die of heart disease every year, women are still grossly underrepresented in clinical trials, as one example. The numbers are even worse for minority women who are at an even greater risk for developing heart disease and who have many more barriers to accessing care. 
   So today, as we pass this resolution to recognize the importance of Heart Month and Wear Red Day, let us use this opportunity to discuss the real changes we can make to improve women's heart health. 
   My colleague, BARBARA CUBIN, and I have introduced H.R. 1014 the HEART for Women Act. This act takes crucial steps to address women's heart health. It ensures that research is stratified by gender. In other words, that we recognize that women need to have research  that will take their needs into consideration, provides for an educational campaign for health professionals, and expands the very successful WISEWOMAN program that conducts cardiovascular screening for low-income women that has been, in the pilot phase, proven very successful in various parts of the country. 
   We had a successful hearing in the Health Subcommittee, and I would like to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for working hard to move this legislation along in, I hope, the very near future. 
   Finally, I would like to thank the Speaker for suggesting that we encourage everyone to wear red tomorrow in order that we be even more visible to all of our colleagues and others on the Hill to continue this very important dialogue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to support this Revolution congratulating the University of California, Santa Barbara men's soccer team for winning the NCAA Division I National Championship. 
   Along with my colleague ELTON GALLEGLY, I am thrilled to have this opportunity to congratulate every player, coach, alumnus, faculty member and supporter of UCSB. 
   On December 3, 2006, the UCSB Gauchos captured the National Championship by scoring two goals against the University of California, Los Angeles. This is UCSB's second national title in school history. 
   While all the gauchos played their hearts out, I'd like to acknowledge two stand-out performances. 
   Sophomore Nick Perera scored a goal and assisted on Eric Avila's game-winner on his way to earning All-College Cup Most Outstanding Offensive Player of the Tournament honors.  
   Junior Andy Iro, despite playing through an injury, helped keep UCLA at bay and was named the All-College Cup Most Outstanding Defensive Player. 
   While the beginning UCSB's season was plagued by inconsistent play, the Gauchos fought to recover, winning 10 of their last 11 games, including 6 straight in the tournament. 
   Coach Tim Vom Steeg, a UCSB alum, and his staff, Greg Wilson, Neil Jones, and Erick Foss, deserve tremendous praise not only for their impressive leadership in the 2006 season but also for leading the dominating Gauchos to their second NCAA National Championship game in 3 years. 
   Coach Vom Steeg's colleagues were so impressed with his coaching abilities that they named him the National Soccer Coaches Association of America National Coach of the Year, the most prestigious award that a Division I soccer coach can receive, for the second time. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the men's soccer team is a great example of the excellence the University produces, there is much more to celebrate. 
   As many of you know, my husband Walter was a professor of Religious Studies for more than 30 years at UCSB. 
   Through his experiences as a professor, and my own as a graduate, I have watched the university rightfully gain national attention. 
   The university currently has five Nobel Laureates on faculty and was recently ranked in the top 15 best public schools in the Nation by U.S. News & World Report. 
   And with a breathtakingly beautiful campus, it's no wonder that the men's soccer team and the university can attract such notable talent from all over the world. 
   If any of my colleagues ever find themselves on California's Central Coast, I encourage you to stop by this beautiful campus and see for yourself all that it has to offer. 
   And of course, don't forget to catch a soccer game at Harder Stadium. 
   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution. 
   Go Gauchos.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (REJECT FUNDING FOR ABSTINENCE-ONLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, 750,000 American teenagers will become pregnant this year. This is clear evidence of a serious problem in our country. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, teen parents are less likely to complete their education and more likely to depend on welfare. 
   Unfortunately, for the last several years the Bush administration has insisted we waste money on abstinence-only education programs that the GAO has deemed ineffective. In fact, a University of Washington study revealed that students who receive comprehensive sex education are less likely to become teen parents than those who receive abstinence-only information. 
   Not surprisingly, my home State of California, which rejects title V abstinence-only funding, has a teen birth rate that is lower than the national average. 
   Madam Speaker, we need to teach our children commonsense decisionmaking skills and not withhold vitally important health information from them. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting any future funding for abstinence-only education. Instead, let's spend it where we will see real results.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (TOM LANTOS PULMONARY HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank the chairman of our Health subcommittee for recognizing me. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6568, for which I am proud to be the lead Democratic sponsor. 
   I want to commend Congressman Kevin Brady for his tireless work on behalf of pulmonary hypertension awareness over the last several years. As the name of this legislation indicates, our dear friend and former colleague, Tom Lantos, was a champion of working against this disease because of a very personal connection, his lovely granddaughter, Charity. 
   I am so proud that we could help the Lantos family fulfill their goal of seeing this bill acted on during the 110th Congress. I am sure that many of us will remember forever the day that Charity testified, that was in December of 2005. 
   She testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee. She so eloquently relayed to us the challenges of getting properly diagnosed and then adjusting to her daily complex routine in order to cope with her illness at the same time she pursued her musical career. 
   Pulmonary hypertension is a very rare disease, which is marked by increased blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, as has been described. There are very few treatments available, and this legislation is aimed at improving research and awareness about the disease so that we can find more effective treatments and, one day, a cure. 
   I want to thank the Energy and Commerce majority and minority staff for working hard to bring this bill up today, for the ranking member of the minority Health committee for insisting that it come before us today, and for the lead sponsor, again, Kevin Brady, for his efforts on behalf of the pulmonary hypertension community. 
   Of course, we thank the Lantos family for their advocacy on behalf of pulmonary hypertension, and the efforts to ensure this bill's passage in Tom Lantos' memory.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this bill. 
   I do so because I simply cannot support the myth that a lack of offshore drilling is at the root of our energy problems, and the supposed solutions to that myth are contained in this bill. 
   I fully support the provisions in the bill that will help America reach the goal of a clean energy future. For example, the bill extends federal tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will expire by the end of 2008. It's critical that these tax incentives be extended to avoid causing significant harm to our country's developing clean energy industries. It would also provide new incentives for purchasing energy efficient products and plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
   I also support the Renewable Electricity Standard included in the bill, which requires at least 15 percent of our national energy production to come from renewable sources by 2020. More than half of the states already have a standard like this in place, including California and Texas. 
   I believe these provisions are clear steps in the right direction and, in fact, would argue we should be doing more of them. 
   But President Bush was right when he said our country is addicted to oil. The U.S. is like the alcoholic who says he needs just one more drink to get him through the day and then tomorrow he will stop. And this recent nonstop effort to open up the entire U.S. coast to more drilling looks to me a lot like a problem drinker in denial. 
   The driving force behind this legislation is the relentless, disingenuous and, in the end, futile attempt to drill our way to energy security. It is doomed to failure because we simply don't have the resources. We consume 25 percent of the world's oil and yet we have only 3 percent of the world's oil supply. Do the math. 
   Or better yet, just look at recent history. Seven and a half years ago, President Bush took office promising to implement a national energy policy that would make America energy independent. The former oilman entrusted his Vice President, himself the former head of the largest oil servicing company in the world, with leading the effort. Since then, the President's energy policy has mostly been about enabling our addiction to fossil fuels by focusing only on increasing domestic oil and gas supplies. 
   For example, between 2001 and 2007, the Bush Administration offered 343 million acres of leases for offshore drilling, selling over 33 million acres to oil and gas companies. And in the last five years, the Republican-controlled Congress gave the President approval for new leasing in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. In fact, the U.S. has more oil and gas rigs operating today than the entire rest of the world. 
   Meanwhile, the Bush Administration energy policy paid lip service to conservation, neatly summed up by Vice President CHENEY's dismissive and uninformed remark that ``conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy.'' 
   And the Administration's lack of interest in developing alternative energy was succinctly illustrated when Congressional Republicans, needing to reduce the overall cost of their ``landmark'' 2005 energy bill, slashed support for alternative fuels while leaving intact tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies for already rich oil companies. 
   The results of these choices aren't pretty: in 2000, the U.S. imported 53 percent its oil; today, that figure is 59 percent. And while consumers pay record high prices at the pump, oil companies are racking up record high oil profits. Exxon-Mobil's last quarterly profits were $11 billion, the largest in human history. The other oil and gas behemoths pulled in similarly spectacular profits. 
   But the failure of President Bush's strategy was both predictable and predicted. Democrats in Congress pointed out that the vast majority of offshore oil and gas reserves were already available for exploitation. Even if they hadn't been and we made them all available to drilling, there is still that troubling U.S. demand versus U.S. supply contradiction. 
   For years, Democrats tried to convince the Republicans then in charge of Congress that real energy security would be found by making our cars, buildings and appliances more efficient; by dramatically speeding up the development of renewable and alternative energy sources; and by beginning the long, hard transition away from fossil fuels that imperil our economy, damage our planet and come mostly from unstable countries all too often wishing us harm. Those arguments were all rejected by the President and his supporters in Congress, leaving us where we are today. 
   To be clear, I don't want to see more oil rigs off my congressional district. My constituents rightfully fear the economic and environmental effects of new drilling. Many of us witnessed firsthand the devastation of the blowout on Platform A off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. We saw the dead birds and seals, the beaches covered with oil, the land that we love so much nearly destroyed. 
   In the years since, despite the great advances touted by the industry, oil accidents and drilling-based pollution in my district have been plentiful, offshore and onshore. For example, Exxon-Mobil recently agreed to pay almost $3 million for releasing dangerous PCB's into the Santa Barbara Channel from Platform Hondo. 
   Another fine example is that of Greka Oil, a company that has been polluting our local creeks with toxic runoff and countless oil spills seemingly without a care. It looks like Greka based its environmental policies on the cutting edge technology found in the movie ``There Will Be Blood.'' I could also site the infamous Torch Operating Company pipeline explosion in 1997, the destruction and rebuilding of Avila Beach brought on by Unocal's decades-long pollution in that coastal town, or the impacts to our local air and water quality that we deal with every day. That is the history--and daily reality--of oil drilling in my congressional district. 
   So, yes, Californians don't want more of that. 
   But my opposition to this bill is mostly because it is simply not in the best interests of this country. The longer we try to fool ourselves into believing that this time new drilling will bring us lower prices and that we still have plenty of time to get ourselves off this oil addiction, the tougher the day of reckoning will be. Our economy will continue to be at the whim of crazy dictators around the world, globing warming will continue unabated and the decisions to send our troops in harm's way will too often be tainted by the stench of oil politics. 
   And just so we are clear, this ``American'' oil we want to drill for is more likely to end up in gas tanks in Beijing or Calcutta than in Washington or Wasilla because oil markets are global. The multinational oil companies that  will sink their rigs off California or Virginia will be selling ``American'' oil to the highest bidder. That is one reason why none other than the Bush Administration's own Energy Information Administration concluded that even opening the entire U.S. coastline to more drilling would have virtually no impact on oil prices. 
   We need to end our addiction to fossil fuels and we need to start now. Expanded drilling off our coasts will not bring us closer to that goal.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, I rise in strong support of the bill. 
   While most government employees enjoy the right to collectively bargain with their employer, many fire fighters, police officers and emergency medical personnel across the country are denied this right. We must take action to end this injustice. 
   The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act would affirm the right of our Nation's State and local public safety officers to bargain collectively and work cooperatively with their employers. This critical legislation would do so by establishing minimum collective bargaining standards for all States. Such standards include: the right to collectively bargain over wages, hours and working conditions, establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism, and the enforcement of contracts through State courts. 
   Our public safety officers put their lives on the line every day to protect us. Yet, they are denied their right to collectively bargain to better protect themselves and their families. Collective bargaining leads to higher wages, greater access to health care and better retirement benefits. Furthermore, cooperation between public safety employees and employers reduces injuries and fatalities because first responders are more likely to have the safety equipment and resources they need. Studies also show that communities promoting communication between public safety officers and their employers enjoy more efficient and effective delivery of emergency services. 
   Over the years, we have expanded collective bargaining laws to protect private sector employees, non-profit association employees, transportation workers, and Federal Government employees. One of the few groups of workers not covered by these Federal laws is state and local public safety officers. They work tirelessly to protect us. We must take this opportunity to help protect them. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Public Employee-Employer Cooperation Act.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (MARITIME POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 802, the Marine Pollution Prevention Act of 2008. I also echo the comments of the ranking member in praise of the bipartisan nature of this legislation. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Mr. Cummings for their leadership in bringing this very important bill to the floor of the House. 
   H.R. 802 authorizes the EPA and the Coast Guard to issue enforcement regulations for the MARPOL Treaty Annex VI, which was approved by the Senate 2 years ago, with the goal to reduce harmful emissions from large oceangoing ships. 
   Implementation of this treaty amendment is an important first step for the protection of the health of our citizens in coastal areas of the United States. We know, for example, that large oceangoing ships are a major source of soot, sulfur dioxide, and smog-forming pollution, strongly associated with premature deaths, hospital visits, and asthma attacks. The emission from these ships can cause serious heart and lung problems, and can contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer. 
   This is clearly important in my congressional district along California's South Central Coast. In 2005, more than 7,000 oceangoing transits were made along our coastline. As these ships come through the Santa Barbara channel, heading to the ports of Hueneme, Los Angeles, and Long Beach, it is the case that the prevailing wind conditions blow most of the air pollution onshore. 
   Currently, these vessels emit over 45 percent of all the emissions of nitrogen oxides in Santa Barbara County, more than all the road vehicles combined. If left unregulated, these ships will contribute almost 75 percent of the county's nitrogen oxide pollution by 2020. This forecasted increase in air pollution from large ships could wipe out the hard won air quality improvements achieved in the last 30 years on California's central coast. 
   It is very clear that action must be taken to reduce these emissions which are impacting the lives of thousands of people living in my district every single day. And as I address this situation so harmful to this particular part of the coastline, I am aware that every coastal district in this Nation, the Pacific Coast, Atlantic, Gulf, and the Great Lakes would be affected perhaps in similar ways. So would the people who wish to visit these beautiful coastal areas. 
   The IMO, Mr. Speaker, is considering adopting new, more effective emission standards for large ships, but the U.S. will only have influence on these new standards if our country completes ratification of the MARPOL Annex VI Treaty via this implementing legislation. So I certainly hope we can seize this unique opportunity where industry, ports, environmental organizations, and regulatory agencies are aligned in moving forward to reduce emissions from this very large source of air pollution. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman for bringing this legislation to the floor of the House today which means so much to my constituents. I urge its immediate passage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act. For far too long we've watched as Pell Grants have stayed flat and tuition has continued to soar, over 40 percent in the last 6 years alone. 
   Students today are graduating with greater and greater debt. As a result, they are increasingly unwilling to take critical public sector jobs such as first responders, law enforcement officials, nurses and teachers because of the modest salaries. For example, nearly 32 percent of graduates pursuing teacher careers can't afford to repay their loans on a starting teacher's salary. 
   By passing the College Cost Reduction Act, we are encouraging and rewarding public service by providing $5,000 in loan forgiveness to graduates who take public service jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is one excellent provision that makes an important investment in our communities, and it's just one of the many reasons I'm going to be supporting this legislation today. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the College Cost Reduction Act.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2. As cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, I am so proud to stand with many of my colleagues, as we repeat over and over today how vital this legislation is for women across this country. Women lag far behind men in terms of earnings. Nearly two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, many raising children. 
   This bill translates into over 9 million women who will benefit from a long overdue increase in their take-home pay. It is abominable that for the past 10 years we have sat by and watched the cost of everything skyrocket. Health care, child care, food, rent, anything you could think of, except for wages. 
   Minimum wage earners often are single moms and have been forced into longer hours, more jobs, more time away from their families, which, too often, has its own set of unfortunate consequences. 
   It is time that we all vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2. Take a great step forward towards achieving economic equality for women. Indeed, the benefits will be there for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and for his leadership on this issue which is so important. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation to reduce interest rates for student loans. In my previous careers, I spent years teaching and caring for students from all walks of life. I have seen firsthand the value of quality education for all students. A lack of good education hurts not only today's students and tomorrow's workers, it hurts our country's efforts to remain competitive in an increasingly global market. 
   Madam Speaker, college is not for everyone, and not everyone needs a degree to achieve their goals, but no one should be denied an education simply because they can't afford the cost of tuition or because they fear being overburdened by tens of thousands of dollars in student loans over the years. We have all seen the rising cost of education; 41 percent increase in the last 6 years alone.     
   Students today graduate with greater and greater debt, which not only hamstrings them but also makes it hard for occupations that need highly skilled graduates but can only afford modest salaries. For example, nearly 32 percent of graduates pursuing teaching careers can't afford to repay their student loans on a starting teacher's salary. And if new graduates can't afford to work in the careers where we need them the most, like teaching, nursing or in social work, then all Americans will suffer. 
   By passing this bill, students starting school this year will be saving an average of $2,490 a year and by 2011 we will be saving students an average of $4,830 over the life of their loans. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5. Help our students pursue their dreams and build our country.

I thank our colleague from Michigan, Mike Rogers, for his work in paving the way for the passage of this bill today. 
   The National Pain Care Policy Act would take important steps to improve the coordination of research and treatment of pain. More than 75 million Americans suffer from pain, both chronic and acute, making pain the most common reason Americans access or try to access the health care system. 
   Yet they often face significant barriers in receiving the proper diagnosis and treatment. Pain is often, too often, only researched and considered as a symptom of another disease, and best practices haven't always been shared across disciplines. 
   H.R. 2994 would amplify research at the National Institutes of Health and also improve education and outreach efforts for health professionals and the general public alike. I am proud of the significant support we have received in the community from various advocacy groups, health professionals and providers.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank our chairman for yielding and for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6353, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy bill. And in doing so, I want to pay tribute to its author, BART STUPAK, who would be here giving this statement except that his voice ran out tonight. So I am stepping in on his behalf, but it is something that I truly support as well. 
   Nearly 7 million Americans are abusing prescription drugs; more than the number of individuals who are abusing cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy and inhalants all combined. 
   Over the past 6 years, we have witnessed a dramatic 80 percent increase in prescription drug abuse from 3.8 million to 7 million. That's more than double. A large number of individuals are obtaining their prescription drugs over the Internet through rogue Internet pharmacies. 
   Purchasing drugs online without a valid prescription can be simple: A consumer just types the name of the drug into a search engine, quickly identifies a site selling the medication, fills out a brief questionnaire, and then clicks to purchase. 
   The risks of self-medicating, however, can include potential adverse reactions from inappropriately prescribed medicines, dangerous drug interactions, use of counterfeit or tainted products, and addiction to habit-forming substances. 
   Several of these illegitimate sites failed to produce information about potential adverse side effects, effectiveness, and where the pharmacies are located. 
   A 2004 GAO study obtained 68 samples of 11 different prescription drugs, each from a different Web site. GAO found that 45 online pharmacies provided a prescription based on their own medical questionnaire or had no prescription requirement. Among the drugs GAO obtained without prescription were those with special safety restrictions and highly addictive narcotic pain killers. 
   The tragic case of Ryan Haight has already been mentioned. His mother has testified before Congress and is nationally known. Ryan died at the age of 18, as has been stated, from an overdose of pain killers, including Vicodin. He ordered these over the Internet without a legitimate prescription while he was a 17-year-old minor. 
   The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act would bar the sale or distribution of all controlled substances via the Internet without a valid prescription. In order for a prescription to be valid, it must be issued by a practitioner who has conducted at least one in-person examination of the particular patient. 
   H.R. 6353 would also require online pharmacies to clearly display on their Web site a statement of compliance with U.S. laws and DEA regulations. This would allow consumers to clearly identify which pharmacies are safe and which are not. 
   This legislation also creates a new Federal cause of action that would allow a State attorney general to shut down a rogue site selling controlled substances in any State and increase the penalties for all illegal distributions of controlled substances classified as Schedule III, IV or V substances. 
   This legislation is supported by the administration, including the DEA and FDA, the Chain Drug Stores, Go Daddy, eBay, Federation of State Medical Boards, and the Fraternal Order of Police. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. I thank Congressman LAMAR SMITH, Congresswoman MARY BONO MACK, Senator Feinstein, Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. I also want to thank Virgil Miller, Ryan Long, Caroline Lynch and Jeff Spalding with the committee staff, and Erika Orloff of Mr. Stupak's personal staff for their hard work on this bill.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1014, the HEART for Women Act. I thank my colleague for yielding to me, and I thank the lead co-sponsor of this bill, Congresswoman Barbara Cubin of Wyoming. 
   I was proud to first introduce the HEART for Women Act in 2006 with the help of organizations such as the American Heart Association, WomenHeart, and the Society for Women's Health Research. Since then, the list of supporters has grown to over 50 organizations, 237 cosponsors in the House, and 47 cosponsors of the Senate companion legislation. 
   This legislation was borne out of the realization that despite heart disease being the number one killer of women, too few people are aware of it. In 2006, only 21 percent of women identified heart disease as women's greatest health problem, and too few people were aware that heart disease manifests itself differently in women than in men. 
   The HEART for Women Act would improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in women in three important ways. 
   First, it would authorize educational campaigns aimed at health providers and older women to make them more aware of the risks for cardiovascular disease among women. 
   Secondly, it will authorize the expansion of CDC's highly successful WISEWOMAN program, to which our chairman alluded. Since 2000, WISEWOMAN has been providing screenings for low-income uninsured women. The CDC has touted the success of WISEWOMAN in that they have screened over 79,000 women in need, identified over 7,600 new cases of high blood pressure, over 7,900 new cases of high cholesterol, and over 1,000 cases of diabetes. 
   I am proud that this legislation will play a part in reaching hundreds of thousands of new women in the years to come. 
   Finally, H.R. 1014 will improve the way we collect and analyze research data. By directing the FDA to collect data about safety and the efficacy of new and investigational drugs and devices according to gender, age, and racial subgroups. 
   We will help women and their health care providers better understand which course of treatment may yield the best outcome. 
   Once again, I thank our colleague Congresswoman Cubin, the coalition of supporters, and the Energy and Commerce Committee majority and minority staff. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1014.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 393 which would recognize October as Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Month, and I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey, our chairman of our Health Subcommittee, for recognizing me. I also want to thank the resolution's sponsor, Chip Pickering, and thank him for his leadership on this topic. 
   I have proudly served with Mr. Pickering as cochair of the Heart and Stroke Coalition for the past 2 years. I have enjoyed working with him as well on the Stop Stroke Act, which we are so close to passing into law, and for his advocacy on behalf of these issues. He will sorely be missed when he retires this year from Congress. 
   Sudden cardiac arrest claims the life of over 300,000 people per year. It's known as SCA, and it can strike at any age in people who appear to be otherwise healthy. We all know the famous stories of young athletes mysteriously dying on the basketball court or the football field. But perhaps none of us know enough about how to prevent it from happening in the future in our families with our loved ones and in the future. 
   There are certain warning signs for sudden cardiac arrest which can be identified through screenings, and we hope that establishing a Sudden Cardiac Awareness Month will help more Americans learn what those warning signs are and to encourage more medical professionals to conduct proper screenings. 
   I'd also like to take this time to promote awareness about the greatest chance for survival after a sudden cardiac arrest: the automated external defibrillators, or AEDs. Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been proud of the efforts to increase the presence of AEDs on school campuses and other public buildings. Many of you are probably familiar with the placement of AEDs on every floor through the Capitol and our office buildings. They are so simple to use and are crucial to improving survival. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of House Concurrent Resolution 393 and help improve awareness about sudden cardiac events and AEDs.

   For the past 4 years, the previous leadership in this Congress has given the President a blank check for his misguided and mismanaged war in Iraq. That war has taken the lives of more than 3,200 of our brave troops, wounded tens of thousands more; countless Iraqis have died. 
   Congress refused to fulfill its constitutional obligation for oversight and its moral obligation to end the war. So today, we take the first step toward meeting those duties.

But tomorrow, with this bill, we all will make a decision. Either we will continue to give this President a blank check in Iraq on a never-ending war, or we will have established a responsible timetable for withdrawing our troops. Bring this war to an end.

   As we look around this world and we look here at home, we see that women are reaching the highest levels of power in many parts of the world and with our own country as well. They are being elected and appointed into positions previously reserved only for men. 
   We see this in our communities, in business positions and education and in civic life and we see it here in Congress. As has been noted, we have for the first time in our 200-year history as a democracy we have a woman Speaker of the House. We have in this 110th Congress the most women who have every served in this House. The Senate can say the same this year. 
   At the same time, today, women remain around the world and here in this country more likely to live in poverty, lack education, be victimized by violence than ever before. 
   It is my pleasure and privilege to serve on the House Democracy Assistance Commission. In that capacity, I have visited several emerging democracies and have met with parliamentarians of other countries where these democracies are emerging. In each case, it is the women Members who reach out to me on behalf of their sisters throughout their country, and note with dismay that they have so many challenges to meet the needs of the women that they serve. 
   I was especially touched when I visited the women of Afghanistan in their 1-year-old democracy who have struggled over the years and are still struggling and are so determined, despite the extreme oppression by the Taliban, determined to take their role in the parliament. Both threats on their lives and harassment and violence have marred that passage. Determined to make a better life for themselves and their children. 
   Let me call out a similar kind of situation, a grassroots networking that I have seen and we have all experienced around this world today, networking to provide microloans from woman to woman, as is one of the nonprofit organizations called, giving women the opportunity to become self-sufficient for themselves and their families. They look to us as role models and as leaders, and yet we have our own challenges here. 
   So as we become that role model for so many democracies around the world in so many emerging democracies, as we see that we have challenges facing our women in this country, let us celebrate then International Women's Day this Thursday making a firmer commitment to improving the lives of women here in the United States and throughout this world.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3221, The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. 
   Today, our economy relies on fossil fuels for energy and we simply must change that. 
   Even President Bush admits we're ``addicted to oil'' and that this addiction is harming our country. 
   The best way to beat this addiction is to stop using so much oil and gas by reducing demand, promoting renewables and alternative fuels, and encouraging smarter technologies. 
   Focusing more attention on the potential of clean energy is something that I and others on this side of the aisle have been advocating for years. 
   And since America is not exactly awash in oil and gas, reducing our dependence on them would be good not only for our environment, but for our economy and our national security as well.  
   But, to be honest, we have to do more than talk about the potential that clean and safe energy has for this country. 
   We have to provide the mechanisms to bring these energy sources to market and make changes in energy policy to encourage their use. 
   And that's exactly what H.R. 3221 does. 
   It encourages the efficient use of energy by creating new and stronger appliance and green building standards, and it promotes smart grid technology and plug-in hybrids. 
   It also takes important steps toward restoring sound stewardship to the management of our public lands by ensuring responsible domestic energy development. 
   And it creates a comprehensive framework to help address the negative impacts of global warming on our wildlife, public lands, oceans, and coasts. 
   While I greatly appreciate the hard work that has gone into crafting this legislation, I look forward to the House doing more. 
   Like increasing fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, increasing the use of homegrown renewables like wind and solar by requiring more electricity come from these resources, and adopting a national policy to deal with global warming. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people want real, meaningful solutions to our nation's energy challenges. 
   The leadership in the last Congress was driven by a futile desire to drill our way to energy independence. 
   It attempted to do that by lavishing huge tax breaks on Big Oil and neglecting efforts to reduce demand and encourage clean energy. 
   This bill delivers on the Democratic majority's promise of a new energy future. 
   It will strengthen national security, promote economic growth and create jobs, lower energy prices and begin to combat the serious threat of global warming. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation because it will pave the way to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, as we approach the Veterans Day holiday, I want to express my support for all men and women who have ever served our country. I congratulate the new Democratic Congress for making remarkable improvements to veterans benefits. 
   During this past year, we have already appropriated the largest increase in veterans health spending ever. We have also taken steps to increase awareness about posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental health needs among veterans. 
   In addition, we seek to improve our ability to prevent, to diagnose and treat these conditions. I especially would like to note a new awareness about the needs of our women veterans, and commend my colleagues in the Women's Caucus for making the needs of women veterans a priority of ours during this Congress. 
   As we commemorate Veterans Day this weekend, let us all make a commitment to continuing and renewing our efforts to improve benefits for all veterans.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. I have been so proud to be a part of the bipartisan effort to advance federally funded stem cell research and commend the tireless work of the bill's cosponsors DIANA DEGETTE and MIKE CASTLE. 
   It is evident that we will pass this bill today, but we know that hurdles remain before the measure is signed into law. Along the way, opponents of this legislation have been spreading mistruths about what embryonic stem cell research entails and what its promises are. How many times have we heard here on the floor today the claim that this research involves the creation of life in order to destroy it? So I reiterate again, the bill explicitly states that only embryos created for in vitro fertilization that would otherwise be discarded and are being discarded every day can be used for this type of research and only with the explicit consent, permission given explicitly by the donors; and also that no Federal dollars are used in the extraction process. 
   It is important above all that we enact this Federal legislation even for a State like mine, California, which does have stem cell research, because we need in this Nation the highest ethical standards which is what the Federal legislation can do. 
   By allowing research to make use of embryonic stem cells slated to be thrown out, we are in fact giving purpose to this. And of course through this research lives will be saved for millions now suffering from debilitating illnesses. 
   Today, we have also been hearing the argument that adult or amniotic stem cell research alone will be enough, but this is not the case. The world's leading scientists concur that all stem cell research should be conducted together in order to maximize the benefits. 
   Our President himself has stated his desire to put the United States at the forefront of science and innovation. Getting him to sign this bill is one way to make that happen. A vote against H.R. 3 would be setting us back even further and would let other countries get much further ahead of us in the effort to cure the world's most chronic and devastating diseases. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote enthusiastically in favor of H.R. 3.

   Millions of people across our Nation and around the world will be paying close attention as we affirm our commitment to finding cures for diseases that have touched all of us: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and many more. 
   I have been truly touched by letters of hope from constituents and from organizations representing those suffering from illnesses that may eventually be cured through stem cell research. 
   And our Nation's leading scientists are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to make the United States the world leader in this groundbreaking research. 
   As Members of Congress, we are blessed with the opportunity to take such an important vote that will pave the way to saving lives. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3 today and be part of this monumental effort.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a strong supporter of Israel, of the Palestinian people, and of achieving a two-state solution where Israel and Palestine exist peacefully side by side. I have had the pleasure of visiting Jerusalem on more than one occasion, and am keenly aware of its importance to people of different faiths. 
   I rise today, however, to voice my disappointment that H. Con. Res. 152 conveys rather empty rhetoric instead of constructive observations and commitments. The United States has always served as the historical broker of peace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors and this is a role that we should continue to fulfill and I believe we should return to taking a much more active role in negotiations than we have under the Bush Administration's tenure. However, passage of a resolution by the United States Congress which fails to recognize the progress of past peace negotiations runs contrary to achieving our ultimate goal of a lasting peace in the region. 
   Jerusalem is the rightful capital of Israel and will forever remain the capital of Israel. However, it has long been understood that a permanent agreement about the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem will be left to final-status negotiations. The sooner the United States returns to a more active participant in the peace negotiations, the sooner we can arrive to a solution for Jerusalem. But in the meantime, I think we tread on dangerous territory when Congress adopts positions that run counter to issues that have yet to be negotiated. 
   Israel's victory in 1967 was necessary to shatter the idea that the State of Israel could ever be destroyed. Make no mistake that I am firmly committed to the viability and security of a Jewish state in Israel. However, it would be naive to ignore the unresolved consequences of the war and foolish to believe that continued occupation does not pose a real threat to Israel's well-being. I hope that we can use the anniversary of the Six-Day War to look forward and reaffirm a real commitment by the United States to achieve at last a workable two-state solution and a lasting peace.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act, and H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. 
   These bills come at a critical time for America--and especially for my constituents on the Central and South Coasts of California. That is why I am extremely disappointed that the President has threatened to veto them both. 
   They include much-needed reforms of the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, and usher these agencies into the 21st century. 
   But they also accomplish three tasks that are vital to the housing market and economy of the Central and South Coasts. 
   First, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act makes permanent the temporary loan limit increases contained in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress enough how vital this provision is for my district. 
   Median home prices in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties are well above the national average, and our families are truly struggling to obtain affordable housing. 
   Second, this bill will stem foreclosures by creating a voluntary mortgage refinancing program that allows families to stay in their homes. 
   Under this program, the Federal Housing Administration has the authority to refinance up to $300 billion in imperiled mortgages. 
   With median home prices in Santa Barbara County alone declining almost 30 percent in the past year alone, it is undoubtedly in the best interests of lenders to participate in this program. 
   Lastly, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act establishes a loan and grant program for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed homes. 
   Just this week one of my hometown newspapers, the Ventura County Star, reported on the negative impact that foreclosed homes have on communities. 
   Lower home values, increased crime, and safety hazards are just a few of the consequences that can result from foreclosure. 
   This bill prevents neighborhood decline by providing targeted assistance to state and local governments. 
   Mr. Speaker, American families need help, and that is exactly what is provided by the housing bills on the floor today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these bills, and I urge the President to work together with Congress in addressing the needs of the hard-working families in America who want to keep their homes.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2739, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. This bipartisan legislation consists of 61 measures that previously passed the House earlier in the 110th Congress. Among the bill's provisions is Section 201, which incorporates H.R. 276, the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station Outstanding Natural Area Act of 2007, a bill I sponsored and was approved by the House on March 5, 2007, by voice vote. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. RAHALL, and chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, Mr. GRIJALVA, as well as the ranking members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for expediting the consideration of this legislation and for bringing S. 2739 before us today. I also want to thank Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer for their support of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act. 
   Section 201 of S. 2739 would designate the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station--located in my congressional district--as an Outstanding Natural Area within the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System. 
   The Piedras Blancas Light Station is located on an 18-acre parcel of BLM-administered land along the Pacific Coast in San Luis Obispo County. The property is adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway and the Hearst Castle State Historic Monument, and it looks over a pristine coastal area that includes the southern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and California Coastal National Monument. It is also nationally recognized as an important monitoring point for migrating whales, and is used by the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Marine Fisheries Service and a number of universities and colleges for marine wildlife and plant research. 
   The Light Station and the surrounding area are also important for tourism. For example, the national historic Light House--built in 1879--is a main destination focal point on the Central Coast, and the peninsula is very popular for viewing sea otters, elephant seals, and sea lions from shore. The elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas attracts an estimated 400,000 visitors annually. 
   In 2001, BLM assumed ownership and management of the Light Station from the U.S. Coast Guard. Since then, BLM, State and local agencies, community stakeholders and conservation groups have developed a very successful partnership to preserve the Light Station. 
   Some of these partners include: the Piedras Blancas Light Station Association; California State Parks; San Luis Obispo County; the cities of Cambria and San Simeon; the California Coastal Conservancy and Coastal Commission; NOAA; and the Hearst Corporation. 
   As a result of their hard work, the site was re-opened to public tours in 2003--for the first time in 128 years! These partners continue to work together on a series of environmental education, historical restoration and resource protection programs. And I'm confidant they will each support and showcase this national designation if enacted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to acknowledge the second and third-graders at Grover Heights Elementary school in my congressional district for their support of this Light Station. In 2006, these students began the ``Pennies for Piedras'' campaign to raise money toward restoration of the lighthouse. By the end  of the school year, the students had raised $1337.30 in pennies to repair Piedras Blancas. I'm happy to report the students at Grover Heights continue this wonderful effort to protect and enhance one of the Central Coast's crown jewels. 
   As you know, my legislation tracks the successful model of designating the Oregon Coast's Yaquina Head as an Outstanding Natural Area, which was signed into law in 1980. Yaquina Head was later included in the National Landscape Conservation System. 
   Like Yaquina Head, the addition of the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the NLCS would be an important step in protecting and preserving this valuable natural and historic resource. It will also focus attention on the restoration of the Light Station and surrounding area, specifically the three on-site National Register properties. And, it will serve as a means to increase public awareness of the Light Station's scientific, cultural and educational values. 
   Specifically, Section 201 stresses long-term conservation of the Light Station by requiring timely completion of a management plan. The management plan would be developed through a public process and include guidelines for restoration of the National Register of Historic Places buildings, including the Light House; public access; ecological and cultural resource management; and, fostering scientific study and research opportunities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Piedras Blancas Light Station is a wonderful resource. It has the potential to serve as a model for future resource management, and therefore would be an appropriate addition to the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System. 
   Again, I would like to thank the Committee on Natural Resources for supporting this bill, which among other things, will designate the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station as an Outstanding Natural Area, and urge its immediate passage.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (COASTAL AND ESTUARINE LAND CONSERVATION PROGRAM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1907, which formally codifies NOAA's Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, informally known as the CELCP program. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Rahall, and the chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. Bordallo, for bringing H.R. 1907 before us today. I also want to join with the ranking member, Mr. Young, in recognizing the author of this legislation, Mr. Saxton, for his leadership in all of the areas that he has worked on, especially in this area. Those comments of my colleague from Alaska were very well said. For years, Mr. Saxton has been a champion for the marine environment, and his passion for our oceans will be missed. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's well-known that more and more people are moving to the coast to enjoy its beauty and its recreational opportunities. An estimated 60 percent of Americans will live along our coasts during the next 2 years. More than ever, the pressures of urbanization and of coastal pollution threaten to impair watersheds, to impact wildlife habitat and to cause irreparable damage to our fragile coastal ecology. 
   We see strong signals of what continuing down this path could bring us: beach closings, fish kills, human health impacts, and a lack of public access to beaches and to coastal waters. That's why we need initiatives like the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, the CELCP program. 
   This existing program pairs willing sellers through community-based initiatives with sources of Federal funds in order to enhance environmental protection. Lands can be acquired in full or through easements, and none of the lands purchased through this program would be held by the Federal Government. It puts land conservation initiatives in the hands of State and local communities. That's why it's supported by the Coastal States Organization. 
   In my congressional district, we've worked collaboratively with coastal communities, with environmental groups, with willing sellers, and with the State to conserve lands around the Morro Bay National Estuary, on the nationally significant Gaviota Coast and near the Piedras Blancas Outstanding Natural Area. 
   These lands are home to a wide variety of plants and animal species that are particularly threatened by encroaching development and pollution. By working with local communities to purchase lands and easements, California has been able to successfully preserve the natural and scenic heritage of some of its last undeveloped stretches of coastline. 
   Mr. Speaker, programs like CELCP will help other coastal States to participate in these community-based conservation efforts. Given the importance of healthy, productive and accessible coastal areas, it's time to formally authorize CELCP. This legislation makes important improvements in the program. It provides a better framework for its administration, and it will ensure the consistent implementation throughout the country. 
   I know that we all would like to do something like this in honor and in the memory of our good friend in his days in Congress, Mr. Saxton. So I want to thank the chairwoman and Mr. Saxton for their leadership on this legislation. I look forward to working with them in the coming days to ensure its passage so that we can fill this vital need for coastal protection. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1907.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in recognition of the Week of the Young Child. I want to thank our colleague from Florida, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is such a good role model, and oftentimes her children are here, and they give testimony to the fact that working moms can be successful parents as well as wonderful professionals in this business that we're in. 
   And I'm pleased to be with some of my colleagues, Mazie Hirono and Jason Altmire and others who may join us, to call attention to the importance of the Week of the Young Child. My daughter and her dearest friend, whom she met in preschool, are visiting and taking part in this; and it's a testimony to the importance of those early years and some life-long friendships that can result as a result of that. 
   As we celebrate this important week, I want to take the opportunity to highlight two very critical programs which our colleague has already mentioned that are so important to young children: The Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, and Head Start. As someone who has spent most of my life working with our kids in our public schools, I know firsthand the power 
   and the importance of these programs for both our kids and our families. 
   Due to the realities and demands of today's family life, there are many young people, many children who are left with too much unstructured time, and we know the hours right after school are the most dangerous and important hours of the day. 
   Unfortunately, parents are working longer hours and often have to leave their children in the care of their siblings or others who should not have to have the responsibility to do this. Child care can often be the second highest cost in the family budget. Sometimes, it's the highest. Child care costs consume roughly 42 percent of the median single parent's family income, at around $10,000 annually. 
   With a growing home mortgage crisis and stagnant economic outlook, parents cannot afford this. It's simply a matter that is of dire consequence to many of our families today. 
   Child care and development block grants enable 162,000 children a month in California to receive adequate child care. As the only source of Federal funding to subsidize child care for low-income families, CCDBG has life-changing effects on thousands of families in California and therefore needs our full support. 
   Unfortunately, this program has been level funded for 6 years, and that is why I'm fully supporting an $874 million increase in CCDBG. This funding would restore the program to an adequate level and provide child care to an additional 39,400 children in California  alone. And as you can see from the chart here, there are children all across this country standing in line, waiting in line. 
   One of the largest circles, if not the largest circle, is the one that designates California where 207,000 children today are standing in line waiting for child care. And you know, we know children don't stand in line. They don't stay. It is not status quo for children. They miss an opportunity. There's a black hole. There's a gap in what they need for their development, and that time goes away, and it never will come back to them. 
   This investment that we need to make here will not only result in boosting children's social development and their school readiness but results in stable and productive employment among parents. The biggest worry that parents have on the job is what's happening to their children at home. The biggest obstruction to their doing their job well is the worry and the constant concern about where their children are and how they're being cared for. 
   Providing the resources for children will help these parents gain promotions in their job and do a better work product for their employers. 
   Additionally, an early childhood education provides a foundation necessary for the child's educational future. For four decades, Head Start programs have so successfully provided early education, health care, social service and parental involvement support for low-income children and their families. This is a proven program. It's tested. It's tried. It has succeeded for over the generations, and we know that this program works. It is one of the most cost-effective ways we can use tax dollars. The program helps children start their education ready to succeed. 
   So much of education is focused on closing achievement gaps, and I believe Head Start is one of the best tools to do that because it starts at the front end before the gaps widen. Sadly, Head Start has received only modest funding increases over the past 7 years. Without an increase, thousands of children could lose access to Head Start because of inflation. The program is fundamental to the education success of thousands of children. We know that, and yet the program can only serve roughly half of the children who are eligible. 
   I know, I believe I have seen it firsthand; Head Start gives all children the opportunity to succeed in school and therefore in life. And I fully support a $1.072 billion increase for this vital program. Our children deserve this support. 
   And now it is my pleasure to relinquish my time to my colleagues who will carry this debate in this hour of conversation forward, and I'm so honored to be amongst them and to know that we are speaking for others in our Congress as well who know that this is the time to act on these matters. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding to me.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CONGRATULATING UC SANTA BARBARA MEN'S SOCCER TEAM -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support House Resolution 70, a resolution that this House passed earlier this week congratulating the University of California Santa Barbara men's soccer team for winning the NCAA Division I National Championship. I use these minutes to give my congratulations to the team and to the community. 
   Along with my colleague, Elton Gallegly, I am thrilled have this opportunity to congratulate every player, coach, alumnus, faculty member, and supporter of UC Santa Barbara. 
   On December 3, 2006, the UC Gauchos captured the National Championship by scoring two goals against the University of California. This is UCSB's second national title in school history. 
   While all the Gauchos played their hearts out, I would like to acknowledge two standout performances. Sophomore Nick Perera scored a goal and assisted on Eric Avila's game winner on his way to earning All-College Cup Most Outstanding Offensive Player of the Tournament honors. Junior Andy Iro, despite playing through an injury, helped keep UCLA at bay and was named All-College Cup Most Outstanding Defensive Player. 
   While the beginning of the Gaucho season was plagued by inconsistent play, the Gauchos fought to recover, winning 10 of their last 11 games, including six straight in the tournament. Coach Tim Vom Steeg, a UCSB alum, and his staff, Greg Wilson, Neil Jones, and Eric Foss, deserve tremendous praise not only for their impressive leadership in the 2006 season but also for leading the dominating Gauchos to their second NCAA National Championship in 3 years. Coach Vom Steeg's  colleagues were so impressed with his coaching abilities that they named him the National Soccer Coaches Association of America National Coach of the Year, the most prestigious award that a Division I soccer coach can receive, and this for the second time. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the men's soccer team is a great example of the excellence the university produces, there is much more to celebrate. As many of you know, my husband, Walter, was a professor of religious studies for more than 30 years at this campus at UCSB before he became a Member of Congress. Through his experience as a professor and my own as a graduate, I have watched this university rightfully gain national attention. 
   The University currently has five Nobel Laureates on faculty and was recently ranked in the top 15 best public schools in the Nation by U.S. News and World Report; and with a breathtakingly beautiful campus, it is no wonder that the men's soccer team and the University can attract such notable talent from all over the world. 
   If any of my colleagues ever find themselves on California's central coast, I encourage you to stop by this beautiful campus and see for yourself all that it has to offer. Of course, don't forget to catch a soccer game at Harder Stadium. Go Gauchos.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the fine colleagues that we have who are from Georgia for giving each and every one of us a chance to speak. I am not from Georgia, and I know he was your favorite son, but I do want to give this as my chance to honor this very distinguished Member of Congress, Charlie Norwood. 
   I rise, Mr. Speaker, today with a heavy heart but also real admiration for the life of this dear colleague of ours, Charlie Norwood. And my heart as well as all of our hearts go out to his family members, to his community, and to all of the people whose life he has touched. 
   I had the privilege of serving on the Energy and Commerce Committee with Charlie for several years and had the opportunity to work with him on initiatives in the Health Subcommittee. And though he and I come from vastly different places on the ideological spectrum, we were often able to see eye to eye on health policy as two health professionals serving in Congress. 
   I was proud to work with him in co-chairing the School Health and Safety Caucus, where we used the opportunity to spotlight ways in which we could improve the health of children through school-based initiatives. I was also honored to work with him on legislation to promote children's dental health. 
   I think we can all agree that Charlie will be remembered as reliably conservative, but also as an independent thinker. His leadership on establishing a Patients' Bill of Rights was exemplary of his willingness to go out on a limb for something in which he truly believed. He introduced that bill shortly before I came to Congress, and the momentum for passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights was one of the main reasons that I was eager to serve on this Health Subcommittee, which he belonged to. 
   I admired his characteristic patient-centered approach to health care policy. It wasn't popular with some of our colleagues, and the President flat-out warned that his bill would be vetoed. But Charlie continued forward and was looking forward to an opportunity to finally pass the Patients' Bill of Rights in its original form in this, the 110th Congress. 
   So I want to take this opportunity to express again my condolences to the Norwood family and to thank them all for the tremendous years, 12 years, of service that they allowed their Charlie to serve with us all in Congress. And I thank my colleagues again.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH MONTH -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 760 which supports the goals and ideals of Children's Health Month. I commend my colleagues, Kathy Castor of Florida and Dave Reichert of Washington, for introducing this important resolution. A school nurse myself for 20 or more years, I can't emphasize enough the importance of reaffirming a stronger commitment to provide better access to health care for children. 
   We absolutely must take greater steps in providing preventive care, promoting healthy habits, and finding cures to chronic conditions that are becoming more prevalent in our Nation's children. 
   Perhaps one of the greatest steps we can take is to finally reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Programs. As this resolution notes, one of the greatest contributors to unhealthy outcomes in our children is a lack of access to care. Our Children's Health Insurance Program would provide health care access to an additional 4 million children who are eligible but not now covered. This bill was supported by 265 House Members and 64 Senators. I hope we will soon see this bill signed into law. Though we know there are other steps we must also take, this is the primary one. 
   There are steps in addition to this legislation that we can take. When one in five children in the United States are overweight, 5 million children are affected by asthma, and 50 million children suffer from allergies, we know we must take steps to improve healthy environments as well as healthy habits. With this resolution, we applaud the efforts of the many families, communities, health care professionals, and others in our communities, and officials as well, who are taking these steps already; and we encourage in this resolution that States be proactive in promoting healthy living habits to children so that they can lead healthy lives as adults. 
   Most importantly, perhaps, this resolution reminds us of what our priorities in this Congress should be. Undoubtedly, our children should be number one. I commend this resolution for reaffirming that. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 335, and I would like to thank the lead cosponsors of the resolution, Ed Whitfield and Donna Christensen. I also wish to strongly commend the Lung Cancer Alliance and other organizations that have supported this resolution. I am so pleased  we could pass this resolution during Lung Cancer Awareness Month. 
   House Resolution 335 calls on the President to declare lung cancer a public health priority and encourages a greater investment in lung cancer research. This could not come at a more important time. 
   We have just seen newly released statistics that show, while overall cancer mortality rates are dropping quicker than ever, lung cancer mortality rates in women are actually increasing. As our Nation is committed to working towards the goal of eliminating all cancer deaths by 2015, the statistics for lung cancer are extremely disappointing. 
   Mr. Speaker, lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women, yet we are perhaps making the least amount of progress in effectively treating it. We must put greater investment into prevention and early diagnosis of lung cancer. This is the only way to improve outcomes. 
   One of the most effective ways to reduce lung cancer incidence is, of course, smoking cessation. I am proud of the remarkable achievements our Nation has made to encourage smokers to quit, and better yet, to teach people never to begin at all. 
   Disappointingly, some of America's leading women's magazines don't share that goal. As many of you have heard and seen, they continue running ads for cigarettes like Camel No. 9 which are clearly targeted at young women. 
   After years of steady decline, smoking rates have remained stagnant from 2004 to 2006. Launching an aggressive marketing campaign targeting young people is a terrible step backwards in our national efforts to reduce smoking. I hope this resolution today will reinforce our commitment to smoking cessation. 
   But one of the lesser known facts of lung cancer is that 8 percent of men and an astonishing 20 percent of women with lung cancer have never smoked. I am very aware of this fact through my own personal experience as my daughter became one of these statistics. I think the Nation as a whole became more aware with more visible cases, such as Dana Reeve. It often takes a high-profile case to propel us into action, and I hope that the growing awareness and action over the past 2 years will continue to improve our understanding of and our ability to confront lung cancer. 
   With a greater investment into integrated, multidisciplinary research organized around lung cancer, we do have a chance of reducing death. Let us use the opportunity of passing this resolution to reaffirm our shared commitment to combating lung cancer deaths, truly making it a public health priority for our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 335. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my dear colleague from Ohio. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in sad support of this resolution to pay tribute to our colleague, the Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   As so many have said, Stephanie had the gift of making us all her friends and, for me and for others, her sisters. 
   As has been said, she was a tireless advocate on behalf of working families and civil rights long before she came to Congress, and she continued her devotion to these causes over the last decade. I was proud to work with her in the last few years against a proposal that would have undermined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Her leadership on this issue was exemplary of her commitment to protecting people against discrimination. I will cherish this opportunity to work with her. 
   She was also a wonderful and active member of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. She cochaired the task force on Women in the Judiciary with her colleague from Ohio and fellow former judge, Deborah Pryce. 
   She also led efforts to raise awareness and to fund greater research into uterine fibroids. This is a disease that affects as many as three and four women over the course of their lifetimes. Yet it's rarely discussed in public. She had the courage to bring this otherwise taboo subject to the forefront in the quest to bring relief to millions of women who have and who will suffer from fibroids. 
   The people of Ohio and of the entire Congress have lost a true champion. For me, there was a personal bond with Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She lost her husband suddenly after she came to Congress, and I had lost mine recently, and so we had a bond, a sad one, but one that we both cherished. We made an agreement that we didn't need to talk. We just needed, when we saw each other, to give each other a hug, and I will cherish those hugs, and that bond still exists. 
   I send my condolences to her son and to her family members, and I hope they know that the grief is shared by all of us, and our dedication to upholding the causes which motivated and for which she showed such great leadership will inspire us to continue and, in each of our own ways, to make that legacy that was Stephanie Tubbs Jones' live on.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and agree with his sentiments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am rising now in full support of the rule and of the underlying bill, H.R. 2831. As chairman of the Democratic Women's Working Group, I am proud of how quickly this Congress is responding to a clear misinterpretation of a law designed to protect individuals from gender discrimination. 
   It has taken us many years to reach a point where Congress now no longer wastes time in correcting an inequity when discrimination against women occurs. This is a real achievement. 
   The bill before us rightly recognizes that victims of pay discrimination should not be punished because they were not aware of the discrimination against them at the outset. The Civil Rights Act exists to protect individuals precisely when they find themselves in the situation Lilly Ledbetter found herself in. It was never meant to be interpreted in a way that provides a loophole for employers to discriminate, but just to make sure that their employees are kept in the dark for 6 months. 
   The Supreme Court ruling, if left to its own, signals to employers that it's, that is why it is so important that we now carry out our responsibility here in the Congress to provide a check and a balance against the Court's ruling. 
   I want to thank Lilly Ledbetter for her courageous zeal in carrying out her efforts to get this injustice corrected. I was impressed when I met her. She came to testify on Capitol Hill, testify before the committee. She knows that this law that we are about to pass will not necessarily rectify her situation. But she knows also, having experienced this inequity over so many years and carrying out her job so faithfully, she got nothing but excellent reports and discovered, as she went to retire, that she had been getting unequal pay all these years. So I commend my colleague from California, Chairman Miller. I think it is so important that we carry out her determination on behalf of her workplace and the women that she represents who are so often sitting in the same situation as she did, finding themselves at their retirement, the fact that they were given unequal pay over all the years. They just didn't know what their colleagues were receiving. 
   So I support Chairman Miller and the committee as a whole for being such strong protectors of workers' rights, regardless of race, gender or disability. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the rule and the bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
   The identification of genetic markers for disease is one of the most remarkable scientific accomplishments we have made. And this ability to identify risks for certain conditions holds so much promise for our ability to identify and practice greater preventive health care in this country. I can never emphasize enough just how important preventive health care is to our well-being. 
   However, as with almost all great scientific advancements, we have also opened the door to a whole slew of unintended consequences. And I fear that preventive health care is put at risk when patients decline genetic testing for fear of insurance or employment discrimination. 
   This bill before us will put aside those fears by offering protection from employment discrimination and closes the loopholes that deter individuals from pursuing information that can save their lives and the lives of others. After all, the biomedical research community is in dire need of greater clinical trial participation. But many patients are wary because they worry that participation in a clinical trial will reveal a genetic predisposition that employers or insurers can use as a basis for discrimination. 
   H.R. 493 will provide individuals the security of knowing that they can take advantage of genetic testing and participate in research without the fear that their employment or insurance status be put at risk. 
   I commend my colleagues LOUISE SLAUGHTER, JUDY BIGGERT and ANNA ESHOO for their tireless work on this bill over the last 13 years. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 493.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I join several of my colleagues in strong support of House Resolution 822. 
   It's a pleasure to honor the Port of Los Angeles on your 100th anniversary and to commend our new colleague from California, Congresswoman Richardson, for calling attention to all of us the importance of our ports and for signaling this specific anniversary of the Port in Los Angeles, our Nation's largest container port. And when you include its neighbor, the Port of Long Beach, this complex is the fifth largest in the world. 
   I also represent a deepwater port, a neighboring port up the coast from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Hueneme, so I also know how important the maritime industry is to the health of our Nation's economy. And ports like the Port of Los Angeles are the gateway into the vastly interconnected global economy. 
   In fact, 95 percent of all international overseas trade moves through our Nation's ports, and much of it, $1 billion a day of economic activity, happens at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In fact, at least one business in every congressional district in this country imports or exports goods through these ports. 
   Madam Speaker, I also want to acknowledge the port's work to improve the region's air quality. This is a big deal. This is a busy port with lots of traffic and has in the past produced lots of congestion. Recently, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach announced a proposal to reduce diesel pollution from trucks at the facilities by overhauling their dockside trucking systems. This is a model that the rest of the Nation would do well to watch and then copy. This is good news for the people working and living near these busy complexes. And I hope other ports in California and around the country will follow their lead. 
   Again, I'm glad the House can recognize the important contributions of this port. I congratulate all its employees, its Members of Congress, and its successful operation of the last 100 years.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for her leadership in the Rules Committee bringing this important bill to the floor, I thank my colleague ROSA DELAURO for her stunning work in bringing this legislation into print, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   Last week, I was fortunate enough to participate in a rally with several of my female colleagues in the House and Senate and our hero, Lilly Ledbetter. Lilly's personal experience is a testament to the Equal Pay Act, which guarantees equal pay for equal work, needs some work of its own. H.R. 1338 closes some existing loopholes so that employees can fight for their deserved wages without fear of retaliation. 
   As we discussed these issues at the event last week, I was inspired and comforted to see such a crowd of young women, many of whom are recent college graduates just starting out in their careers. They can be sure that with the passage this legislation, they may not face the same barriers that women from their mothers' and grandmothers' generations faced. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation. Help us secure a better economic future for our daughters, our granddaughters and their friends.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act, I rise in strong support of the bill. 
   Voting is the most fundamental element of democracy. It is the mechanism by which citizens hold their government accountable for its actions. This most critical of democratic actions depends, however, on voters' confidence  that their votes are counted fairly and accurately. 
   Voters have lost this confidence. 
   Election after election, year after year, millions of voters cast votes not knowing if their votes will count because the machines produce no paper records. 
   The Help America Vote Act of 2002 was supposed to resolve these problems. However, it failed to address several major issues that continue to plague the system and undermine the legitimacy of our elections. 
   This so-called response to the 2000 election debacle in Florida failed to implement accountability measures to ensure that every vote is cast and counted accurately. 
   The Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act would address this problem by providing funding for states and counties to implement safe, secure and auditable voting systems in time for the 2008 general election. 
   It would reimburse jurisdictions that choose to convert to paper-based voting systems. The reimbursements also cover emergency paper ballots used in the event of machine failure, and the cost of conducting hand-counted audits or hand counting the results of elections. 
   We must act to restore confidence in our election system. The Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act will help restore this confidence and help ensure that all votes are counted and recorded properly. I urge my colleagues to fulfill their responsibility to American voters by voting yes on this critical bill.

   For more than 3 years, when the President came to Congress to ask for funding for Iraq, the Republican leadership's only question was, ``How much?'' 
   When the President wanted to extend the tours of duty for troops already deployed and imposed stop-loss orders, the Republican leadership's only question was, ``How soon?'' 
   And when the President decided to send more troops to Iraq in one of the failed surges, the Republicans only asked, ``How many?''

   Today we stop writing blank checks for this war. 
   We vote today for a new direction in Iraq.

   I am also struck by the importance of the partnership that is highlighted with this legislation, a partnership between this legislative body and our colleagues in the National Institutes of Health and work that we should be doing together on behalf of the American people. 
   As Dr. Francis Collins and his wonderful staff of the Genome Project have taught us, the identification of genetic markers for disease is one of the most remarkable accomplishments scientists have ever made. Being able to identify risks for certain conditions holds such great promise for our ability to identify and practice greater preventive health care in this country. The importance of preventive care to our well-being and our optimum health can never be overemphasized. 
   However, as with almost all great scientific advancements, we have also opened the door to a whole slew of unintended consequences. Preventive health care can be put at risk if patients decline genetic testing for fear of insurance or employment discrimination. We need to work together, and we will, on ways to promote ethical genetic testing, coupled with appropriate privacy protections and with measures such as we are doing today to prevent discrimination. 
   This bill accomplishes these goals, and I am extremely proud to support it. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on its passage

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. 
   It is long overdue for our Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government, to provide its employees with a more family-friendly workplace. 
   It is hard to believe the United States is the only industrialized nation that does not provide its employees with paid family leave, especially considering 75 percent of Fortune 100 companies already provide an average of six to eight weeks of paid parental leave. 
   H.R. 5781 would provide Federal employees with four weeks of paid leave following the birth or adoption of a child. Currently, new parents have to use vacation time, if they have it, or accept unpaid leave to care for a new child.  
   This puts incredible economic strain on Federal employees and their families. Considering the current economic downturn, forgoing several weeks' pay at the same time one's household expenses increase for newborn care leaves many families in a desperate financial situation. 
   Yet President Bush has again ignored the needs of the American people, and threatened to veto this important bill based on a bogus claim of fiscal responsibility. 
   During these times of economic troubles, the President's charade of fiscal conservatism is hurting our economy, hurting our workforce, and hurting American families. 
   All of us here in Congress appreciate the value and importance of public service. Federal workers have chosen a career in public service, and they should be rewarded with fair benefits. 
   It is time to finally give Federal employees the benefits they deserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' H.R. 5781.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague from Missouri for yielding. 
   As a representative of areas affected by the recent wildfires and a cosponsor of H. Res. 778, I rise in its strong support. Over the last 10 days, wildfires have devastated much of Southern California. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been burned. Thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. 
   While this tragedy has faded from the Nation's headlines, thousands of our first responders, military personnel, volunteers continue to battle the fires and to aid in the recovery effort. Today we commend these amazing individuals. Thousands of firefighters from throughout California and across the Nation put their lives on the line to protect our communities. They battled out-of-control flames fanned by restless hurricane-force winds, and they fought tirelessly for 12, 24, even 36 hours straight. 
   In addition, countless police officers and military personnel and other first responders successfully executed the largest evacuation in California's history. Tens of thousands of evacuees were sheltered with ample food, supplies, and facilities. Thousands of generous individuals have given their time, their money, their resources to help victims of this tragedy to get back on their feet. 
   Mr. Speaker, California is sadly all too familiar with wildfires. My district includes parts of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, each of which experience wildfires almost annually. The most recent was Zaca fire which burned more than 240,000 acres of these three counties and lasted almost 3 months. 
   I am proud to say from firsthand experience that California's emergency preparedness systems and procedures are among the best in the Nation, I would say in the world. As the wildfires grew in size and numbers, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services was able to coordinate and allocate resources to the areas that needed them most, regardless of jurisdiction. Local firefighters from San Diego battled flames along with colleagues from Nevada, while planes from Wyoming and Colorado filled their tanks at Channel Islands Air National Guard Station just outside my district. 
   If it were not for this organized and swift effort, many more acres, homes, and lives would have been lost. Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, I hope we can learn from this experience to help prevent such a tragedy from repeating itself in the future. And to the countless men and women who helped in this tragedy, we commend you and we thank you for your heroic efforts.

I would like to commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representatives Ed Markey and Cliff Stearns, for their diligent work in bringing this resolution before us today. 
   Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening, in fact it is a fatal genetic disorder, that currently afflicts over 30,000 Americans, with 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The disease affects the respiratory and digestive systems, causing serious health problems in organs such as the lungs, intestines, and the pancreas. Cystic fibrosis has no cure, and although treatment has been greatly improved, the average life expectancy for people with this disease is only 37 years. 
   With greater awareness of cystic fibrosis, we hope to encourage much more investment and research and treatment into this disease. That is why I am proud to cosponsor House Concurrent Resolution 299 which encourages Congress to support the National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. 
   The resolution rightly praises the many public-private partnerships which have sprung up in the last few years, and it also stresses the promise of innovative research on cystic fibrosis, and this is the environment that we need today which is critical to finding a cure for this fatal disease.

   I am proud to support H.R. 6331, our seniors and our health care professionals who need this legislation. Yes, this is an 11th-hour fix, so it is not the best way to do business here. It allows me to express a strong word of appreciation for our Chairman Dingell and chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Pallone, for their leadership in bringing to the floor and supporting a long-term solution which we passed in this House last year, known as the CHAMP Act, a comprehensive way to deal with challenges for our seniors on Medicare. 
   It is a solution that will bring us to where we should be in the long-term for reimbursing our physicians and those who provide services. So until we have a new administration in the White House, we have to do what we can to protect physicians and to protect their patients. H.R. 6331 does the right thing by preventing a 10 percent cut in reimbursements. And we all know the stories of our senior citizens who fear the loss of their provider, particularly in hard-to-serve areas like rural America. 
   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to vote to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which will temporarily suspend filling the Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR. 
   Paying top dollar to fill the SPR is a poor use of precious taxpayer dollars, particularly when there's no pressing need to add additional petroleum to the reserve at this time. 
   What's more, experts say that temporarily suspending the fill of the SPR is something that can be done right now to immediately lower gas prices for American families. 
   As oil and gas prices continue to climb to new record highs and with the summer driving season approaching, consumers are in dire need of immediate relief from skyrocketing prices at the pump. 
   Over the last 6 years, the price of oil has risen by nearly $100 and gas prices have more than tripled. 
   According to recent projections by the Energy Department, consumers are likely to face even higher prices at the pump this summer. They project that gas prices could rise to above $4.00 per gallon during the summer driving season. 
   Despite these record energy prices, the U.S. is currently taking 70,000 barrels of oil a day off the market to continue filling the SPR. Moreover, the Energy Department recently announced plans to increase this SPR fill rate to 76,000 barrels per day before the end of the summer. 
   Mr. Speaker, this just doesn't make any sense. 
   Even President Bush has suspended SPR purchases in order to lower fuel prices. In April 2006, President Bush said:  
   I've directed the Department of Energy to defer filling the reserve this summer. Our strategic reserve is sufficiently large enough to guard against any major supply disruption over the next few months. So by deferring deposits until the fall, we'll leave a little more oil on the market. Every little bit helps.  
   Well, the President was right about something: every little bit does help. It's time to halt filling the SPR. 
   What's surprising is that now President Bush is rejecting bipartisan calls from Congress to once again suspend filling the SPR. It's curious that the President would now reject a sound proposal that he once embraced even though gas prices are now at record highs. In the absence of the President's leadership, the Democratic Congress is stepping in to force the administration to do the right thing and suspend filling the SPR. 
   Allowing more oil to reach the market will send a signal to oil speculators and will provide the type of immediate, targeted relief that we need right now. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6022, to help American families with skyrocketing gas prices.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 322 and join my colleagues in congratulating the people of the State of Israel on the 60th anniversary of their independence. 
   In its short 60 years as an independent nation, Israel has made remarkable achievements in all sectors of society. 
   Despite its tumultuous experiences, Israel is a vibrant democracy that embraces a free press and political dissent. 
   Israel has also contributed remarkably through miraculous breakthroughs in medicine, revolutionary technological advancements, cultural icons and an agricultural system that is a model for the entire world. 
   But the one thing Israel has yet been unable to achieve is a lasting peace with its neighbors. 
   Wouldn't the best way to celebrate Israel's 60th anniversary be a renewed commitment to peace? 
   We know that peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution. 
   The Palestinian people's legitimate political aspirations must be realized in order for the people of Israel to live safely and securely. 
   I have spent time with Israelis and Palestinians and the message they convey is universal. 
   They just want to live in peace knowing that the future for their children is brighter than the past they have experienced. 
   It is time for us to focus on our common goals rather than our differences. 
   It is time to foster the people-to-people programs that connect Israelis and Palestinians on more human levels. 
   Peace for Palestinians and Israelis is in the best interest of everyone in the region and also the United States.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (NEWBORN SCREENING SAVES LIVES ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 1858, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act. This legislation would facilitate the creation of Federal guidelines on newborn screening and would assist State newborn screening programs in meeting these guidelines. 
   Newborn screening is used for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic, metabolic, hormonal, and functional conditions for which there may be an effective treatment or intervention. If left untreated, these disorders can cause death, disability, mental retardation and other serious conditions. Every year, more than 4 million infants are born and screened  to detect conditions that could threaten their lives and their long-term health. 
   Senate bill 1858 will educate parents and health care providers about newborn screening. It will improve follow-up care for infants when illness is detected, and it will help States expand and improve their newborn screening programs. 
   It is very important to note that the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a markup of House companion legislation H.R. 3825, which was introduced by my colleague, LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD. And I want to say a word of commendation toward LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, who has really worked diligently over quite a period of time to make sure that this bill reached the floor today. She couldn't be here to speak on behalf of the legislation, but I know that there has been a great deal of leadership that has brought us to this point today. 
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee amended H.R. 3825 to ensure that it was identical to the Senate bill, 1858, which has already passed the Senate by unanimous consent. And so the good work of our friend, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard, has brought us to this point and to the commitment that I share on this important piece of legislation. 
   I appreciate all of her efforts to carry this legislation forward and admire her dedication to helping the children and families affected by these conditions. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join in support of Senate bill 1858. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1237, the Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation would modernize Federal regulations under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Act of 1988, CLIA, that subject those who screen and interpret Pap tests to annual proficiency testing. 
   In 2005, CMS launched a program to begin testing pathologists and other laboratory professionals who performed Pap tests for proficiency. However, the program was designed using regulations written in 1992. In the 13 years between the regulation and the program's start, significant investments were made in the science and practice of Pap tests. Instead of relying on outdated practices, H.R. 1237 draws on the best that science and technology has to offer. 
   H.R. 1237 has 175 bipartisan cosponsors, including myself and every other female member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Additionally, this bill is supported by the College of American Pathologists, the American Medical Association, the American Clinical Laboratory Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American College of Nurse Midwives. 
   I want to commend my colleagues, Representative Gordon and Representative Deal, for their hard work and commitment on this very important piece of legislation.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act. This legislation reauthorizes the Emergency Medical Services for Children ``EMSC'' program. The EMSC program ensures state-of-the-art emergency medical care for ill or injured children and adolescents. 
   Since its establishment more than 20 years ago, the EMSC program has driven major improvements in emergency care for children. In fact, injury-related deaths among children have dropped by 40 percent over that time period. Enormous strides have been made in areas such as ensuring that all ambulances carry appropriate pediatric supplies and equipment, and in collecting data on pediatric emergency care to inform future quality improvement efforts. Although much progress has been achieved, more remains to be done. 
   H.R. 2464 is an important piece of legislation that will work toward ensuring the best emergency medical care for children. 
   I would like to congratulate my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Jim Matheson, and commend him for his hard work and dedication to this important piece of legislation.

   Falls represent a serious health risk for millions of older Americans. In the United States, one of every three persons age 65 or older falls each year. Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and the most common cause of injuries and hospital admissions for trauma in older adults. 
   Senate bill 845 seeks to address the growing problem of falling and fall-related injuries among older adults. This legislation would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to oversee and support national and local education campaigns focused on reducing falls and preventing repeated falls among older adults. It is important to note that the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a markup of the House companion legislation H.R. 3701, the Keeping Seniors Safe From Falls Act, which was introduced by Health Subcommittee Chairman Frank Pallone. The committee amended H.R. 3701 to ensure that it was identical to Senate bill 845, which has already passed the Senate by unanimous consent.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. I want to commend the leaders of the bill in the House who have spoken already. This version of the bill we are considering today represents bipartisan and bicameral consensus. 
   It would fund, as we have heard, important research, treatment, surveillance and educational activities related to trauma and traumatic brain injury, commonly known now as TBI. The funding would support ongoing efforts at the National Institutes of Health, which are so important, and also the Health Resources and Services Administration and the CDC. 
   Reauthorizing this program will strengthen the goal of understanding and addressing TBI and strengthening our capacity to treat it. This current war has made us all too much familiar with the devastating effects of TBI and the importance of coordinated interventions to treat it. The war in Iraq and Afghanistan underscored the importance of this legislation, but by no means do these situations only arise in times of war. 
   We know that traumatic brain injury has been occurring all along with all kinds of traumas, traumas to the head and sometimes unsuspected injury that can result from other traumas. And so we need to, for a variety of reasons, pass this legislation and get this bill signed into law. 
   I want to acknowledge my friend and colleague Congressman BILL PASCRELL and also Congressman Platts from Pennsylvania. This leadership has brought us to this point. I know that our Health Subcommittee is pleased to be a part of this legislation.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1198, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act. I'm very proud to have introduced this bill with Congressman Jim Walsh of New York, who has championed this issue for many years. 
   This bill is near and dear to me as cochair of both the Hearing Health Caucus and the Infant Health and Safety Caucus. 
   The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program is one of those success stories that are often rare in Washington. Since its authorization in 2000, we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of newborns who are being screened for hearing loss, but our work is not done. We need to ensure that every newborn is screened and that every family that needs access to follow-up care is given that access. 
   I have been a school nurse for over 20 years, and in those years, I can tell you firsthand what happens to a child who has undiagnosed hearing loss and/or never received proper intervention. They may fall behind in school and they may face other social difficulties. Early identification and intervention are essential to a child's well-being, and that's what we aim to achieve through the reauthorization of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act. 
   I would like to thank the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance, the American Academy of Audiology, and the March of Dimes for their support of this legislation. Let's continue to build upon the success of the past 8 years and make sure that every child has access to diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for yielding and for your leadership on this and the other health bills that we have been dealing with lately. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, known as the STOP Stroke bill. I have been very proud to work on this legislation over several years with my colleague, Chip Pickering; and I am thrilled that it has come before the House today. I thank our staffs for all of us and those who have supported this legislation in the past, particularly calling to mind the groups that Mr. Chairman mentioned in support of the legislation, groups across the country made up of survivors of stroke and those who are very interested in what we do here today. 
   It has been mentioned that stroke is the Nation's number three killer, a leading cause of long-term disability, and it's also known but not widely understood that stroke affects all age groups, not just the very elderly. It cuts through every socioeconomic and ethnic group. It really is a very significant destroyer of lives and homes and families, as it has such devastating results as it affects people.     
   Across this country, someone suffers a stroke every 45 seconds. 
   In my State of California, stroke accounts for approximately 7 percent of deaths. In 2004, that amounted to nearly 17,000 individuals. So many of these deaths due to stroke are preventable. Others are treatable. 
   The staggering numbers of death and long-term disability due to stroke means that it is now time that we pass into law a comprehensive plan for preventing, for diagnosing, and for treating stroke. H.R. 477 would accomplish this goal by authorizing the resources needed to implement coordinated stroke systems. 
   The bill's first initiative would create a national awareness campaign that would educate both patients and providers. Not enough people know the symptoms of stroke when it impacts them. 
   We must standardize prevention and early treatment in order to achieve real results in our fight against stroke. In order to further improve education about stroke prevention, diagnosis and treatment, this bill will authorize grants for qualified health professional programs so that providers are equipped with the most up-to-date information and technologies. 
   H.R. 477 would also maintain the Paul Coverdell Registry, which serves as a clearinghouse of information about stroke care and best practices. 
   And, finally, it would make up to seven grants available to conduct pilot projects on how we may be able to improve stroke outcomes through telehealth networks. 
   I am very proud of this bill's comprehensive approach to improve our ability to manage stroke in the United States. 
   Only when we tackle this disease from all angles, from prevention, from treatment, from coordination of care, can we really make progress. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 477. And I look forward to seeing it finally signed into law.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act. 
   I am pleased that in the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, the Democratic leadership is taking up legislation of enormous importance: how to make our Nation safe from future terrorist attacks. 
   As a Nation, we must work harder to close the security gaps that still exist. For example, we know that transportation systems are a frequent target of terrorist attacks. In fact, one third of the terrorist attacks that take place around the world's largest transportation systems. 
   As many have observed, our Nation's security is only as strong as our weakest link. This bill will help strengthen some of our weakest links, especially with respect to security at our ports. 
   Today only about 5 percent of the more than 11 million shipping containers destined for the United States are inspected or scanned. We cannot own or control the entire global trade network, but we can and should ensure the security of containers destined for this country. 
   Security experts agree that nuclear weapons, or bomb-making materials, could easily be smuggled into the country under the current regime. 
   Beyond the human toll, an attack on or through our ports would have a dramatic economic impact and could bring the flow of commerce to a dead stop. A terrorist attack on our ports--or an attack carried out through a cargo container system--would undermine our Nation's confidence in the hundreds of thousands of containers that crisscross our country every day. 
   I'm proud to represent one of the busiest commercial ports on the West Coast--the Port of Hueneme. The employees at the Port and the people that live and work around it appreciate that this bill will finally close this glaring security gap. 
   H.R. 1 ensures that every container is scanned using the best available technology before being loaded onto a ship destined for our country. And it mandates a gradual implementation to ensure that overseas ports have the time to purchase and install new scanning equipment. These measures will ensure that commerce will continue to flow as these important security measures are taken. 
   As you know, this legislation is modeled on the operations conducted at container terminals in Hong Kong, which scans 100 percent of cargo containers without impeding commerce. The cost of creating this security system is quite minimal. In fact, the estimated cost to scan a container is only $6.50--a drop in the bucket given it costs about $4,000 to ship a container from Asia to the United States. 
   All Congress needs to do is make 100 percent scanning the policy of the United States. And this legislation would do just that 
   To protect the security of our Nation, Congress must act to implement this recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, and the others included in this legislation, to further secure our homeland. 
   Mr. Speaker, we continue to confront grave threats, and there is no greater priority than ensuring the safety of our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act. 
   This bill continues the Democratic-led Congress' efforts to protect and promote the American Dream of homeownership. 
   We can now see clearly that questionable and even discriminatory lending practices were a part of the real estate ``boom'' in our country. 
   In my district, these unscrupulous practices will result in about a half billion dollar loss in home equity for my constituents. 
   This translates into over 80,000 homes devalued and the certainty of foreclosure for many. 
   That is 80,000 families that entered into their mortgage contracts in good faith. 
   They did not anticipate that all of their hard work would be wiped out with one interest rate hike. 
   Many nonprofits and other economic development groups in my district, like the Cabrillo Economic Development Center, have stepped up to help these families restructure their loans and keep their homes. 
   And I am happy to say that today the House will do its part to stop harmful predatory lending practices. 
   This bill will create minimum standards for mortgage loan originators, and require the determination that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay their loan. 
   Importantly, it also discourages ``steering'' a consumer toward a higher-cost loan when they in fact qualify for a lower interest rate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and put our families back on track to achieving the American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague Diane Watson for her leadership in gathering us together, and I rise with my colleagues to extend my condolences, heartfelt, from this body to the family, to the friends, to the constituents of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   This is a somber hour because we are, as my colleague, the dean of our California delegation, mentioned, we are heartsick over this loss, and maybe it is because Juanita was such a striking presence, so dynamic, so poised and articulate. When she entered a room, you knew she was there; and now, today, as we gather so soon after we heard of her death, just yesterday, walking through the doors of the Capitol, I thought it is not the same place now because she is not going to be there, wearing something striking, something beautiful, and with her elegance and grace. 
   We will miss her. We will always miss her. She served in this place, as she served her community and her family and her city council and the State legislature, with such distinction, with passion and with dedication for the benefit of her community and with enormous patriotism. 
   This talented public servant was a champion for several years, including fighting HIV/AIDS, improving women's health, encouraging women in business, protecting voting rights, stopping the genocide in Darfur. As I mention these issues, I think to myself her charge to us this evening would be to stop the sweet talk about her and get busy and solve these problems. That is the best thing we can do in her memory, in her name. 
   She knew where the challenges lay in our country, in the way we go to the polls and the fairness of our elections, the availability of the opportunity to vote for every single American. She was not content. It is not solved yet and we have to do this in her honor. 
   The genocide in Darfur, until that is a thing of the past, we cannot rest. We have got to do this now for Juanita. 
   HIV and AIDS and all of the other things she cared about, now we have an increased motivation, and that is how we can turn our sorrow into something positive, the way she did with her life. 
   We have heard from our colleagues this evening, and we will hear many things, but in particular, I want to speak today as I follow in her footsteps as cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. During the 107th Congress, she was cochair of the Caucus for Women's Issues, serving ably with Congresswoman Judy Biggert. 
   Under their leadership, the women's caucus initiated the first annual Memorial Day tribute to women in the military at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Now this event, thanks to Juanita, has become an annual tradition and highlights the caucus' strong commitment to supporting our brave women in uniform. I know Juanita will be proud of us as we continue in this tradition. 
   As cochair of that caucus, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also convened the first meeting between women Members of Congress and the Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Gingsberg in order to discuss issues of national importance to women, especially in the judicial area. 
   On a personal moment, I will never forget the first time I met with my colleague, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald. It was during a very difficult moment in my life after the passing of my husband Walter. The first thing I knew she was there in my district with every single one of her staff members to help me to succeed him in office. It was a very rainy time, and there they all were, walking precincts in my district, and that was how I met Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   She made a special effort to reach out to me and to my family in ways that were very meaningful to me. She shared with me that her father was a preacher like mine was, so we had that kind of bond as well. And I know it has been mentioned how ferociously she worked on issues like the C-17 and the Alameda Corridor, but if you ever flew with her in her service on the Transportation Committee, you knew very well that she wanted that airline to work for, not her, but for all of us Members and all of the passengers, and she made sure whatever flight we were on was going to be on time to the best of her ability. 
   These are stories that I am not going to ever forget and I want to be grateful for her kindness to me, and pledge during this very challenging time in my life, she was there for me, and now we reach out to her family members. All of us are going to miss our colleague and our thoughts and prayers are with her during this difficult time. 
   It was just pictured, such a wonderful picture of Juanita Millender-McDonald in her local paper, the Los Angeles Sentinel, and ironically, it is dated Thursday, April 22, and that was when she took leave. And who would have known on the paper in her community  that just a few days later she would be gone. But I think it would be befitting her to have this entered in the Congressional Record in memory of Juanita.  
   Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald Will Take Four to Six Weeks Off To Seek Treatment for Cancer  
   Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald is taking a leave of absence until May 25 in order to seek proper care and spend quality time with her family after being diagnosed with cancer. 
   It had been rumored for some time that her health was troubling especially since she had been placed on the ``prayer list'' at her local church, Second Baptist Church in Los Angeles. However, she has always been a fighter for the community and now the community stands ready to return her hard work and efforts on its behalf with prayer and best wishes. 
   McDonald is currently serving her seventh term in Congress representing the 37th Congressional District, which includes parts of Carson, Compton, Long Beach, Los Angeles and Signal Hill. Presently, she is the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, the first Black woman to hold that position. As chairwoman, she has investigated the voting irregularities and disenfranchisement in Ohio, which was the first election reform field hearing in Congressional history. 
   Glamour Magazine recently dubbed her as ``one of the eleven women who will change the world'' and a recent news report cited her as one of the five most effective members of Congress because of her ability to reach across party lines to effectively move bipartisan legislation. 
   Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and the representative of the 9th Congressional District of California, extended warm greetings to her colleague and offered these words of comfort. 
   ``Our prayers are with Congresswoman McDonald and her family. We wish her a speedy recovery and hope that her leadership and courage will soon be back with us in the nation's capital,'' Lee said. 
   Councilman Isadore Hall of Compton's Fourth District was touched when he received word of her health concerns. 
   ``Right now we are holding her up in deep prayer and hoping for a speedy recovery,'' said Hall. ``Certainly her presence will be missed, but we know she has competent staff who will be able to move swiftly with the agenda she has set for the community.'' 
   This is not the first time that McDonald has faced health issues. In 2005, she underwent major surgery for an unknown illness. Last year, her son, R. Keith McDonald, requested a furlough from his 41-month prison sentence for political corruption charges in order to see to her condition at the time. 
   The judge granted him a six-month release but again, there was no official comment from McDonald on her condition then and there is no comment now if either incident is related to her current situation. 
   Dr. William Epps, pastor of Second Baptist Church where McDonald is a parishioner, relayed his thoughtfulness by saying that he stays ``in touch with her weekly'' and that ``I'm keeping her in prayer for strength as she faces her health.'' 
   She reportedly will maintain a limited schedule particularly in her district and this apparently will be to expedite her recovery process. She has requested respect for her privacy at present and all of her constituents have offered their prayers and best wishes for a speedy recovery.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, on this National Teacher Day, I rise to single out just one of the many talented teachers in my congressional district. 
   Libby Anderson teaches second grade at Grover Heights Elementary School in Grover Beach. It's a national blue ribbon school. She is one of those gifted teachers with a truly unique way of igniting the interest of her students. 
   A few years ago, she led a class project where each student picked a lighthouse to study from around the country. Through that project one student learned of the Federal efforts to restore the Piedras Blancas lighthouse in my district. 
   Under her guidance, the class embarked on a campaign called ``Pennies for Piedras'' to raise money toward this effort. By the end of that school year, the students had raised $1,337.30 in pennies. 
   I'm happy to say that her students have gone on to lead support for continued restoration of this special place. 
   This is just one example of the many exceptional ways this teacher touched the lives of her students and expanded their awareness of their community. 
   Our country is blessed to have teachers like Ms. Anderson who spark students' passions, encouraging them to get involved in the world around them.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (NATIONAL NURSES WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1086 and in support of National Nurses Week. I commend my friend and fellow nurse, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), for introducing this resolution. As we observe National Nurses Week, I hope we can work together to raise awareness about important issues facing our nursing community and the important impact that nurses make to  the lives of patients and their role in the arena of public health. This is central to our delivery of health care.     
   We know that nurses advocate for their patients and provide personal care at the bedside. Often, it is life-saving care. They are also community educators, primary care providers, and they serve in our military so often putting themselves in harm's way to carry out their duties. 
   But we are facing a terrible shortage of nurses. We are jeopardizing our ability to provide the best quality care which each individual and each family deserves in this country of ours. As a registered nurse currently serving in Congress, I feel it is my duty to advocate not only on behalf of my patients, but also on behalf of my fellow nurses. 
   I am co-Chair of our House Nursing Caucus, and I was honored to be joined by 155 of our colleagues in a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting additional funding for nurse education programs. These programs have trained thousands of nurses, but we are in desperate need of so many more. And the very fact that we are funding title VIII nurse education at the same exact amount that we did over 30 years ago is, quite frankly, inexcusable. 
   In addition, nurses face difficult conditions in the workplace such as mandatory overtime, unsafe staffing numbers, hazardous lifting, and other workplace settings. These conditions are directly contributing to our inability to retain many qualified nurses in the hospital setting. As our Baby Boomers retire and our demand for nurses soars, let us use this week as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to our current and our future nurses and thereby to a safer and healthier Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the troubled state of our world's oceans. Last month, I attended an ocean science summit in Monterey, California. Also there were State and Federal policymakers and scientists concerned about our oceans and the lack of attention our Federal Government has given them. 
   This year's summit marked the 10-year anniversary of the Year of the Ocean and the oceans conference in Monterey attended by President Clinton and Vice President Gore. In the intervening 10 years, the Federal Government has done little to address the oceans' growing problems, ranging from overfishing to pollution to coastal development and global warming. California and Massachusetts have had to step into the breach, but problems as big as our oceans can't be addressed by a few States. 
   Fortunately, there is a solution. Oceans 21, introduced by Representative Farr and moving through the Natural Resources Committee now, establishes a national oceans policy and a framework for national and regional management of our shared ocean resources. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to sponsor Oceans 21. Join us, and help provide stewardship for this vast resource and protect it for future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 331. National Women's Health Week is celebrated annually during the week following Mother's Day. The purpose of this week is twofold. 
   First, we can use it to raise awareness about the health risks all women face, especially the risks that are unique to women. We use it to learn that, for example, heart disease is the number one killer of women, and half a million women die every year in childbirth. 
   But the second purpose is so we can take proactive measures to improve women's health. We can use this opportunity to remind our sisters, our mothers, our daughters and our friends to get annual checkups and screenings that are recommended for them at their age. And we can use this opportunity to adopt healthier lifestyles that are essential to preventing chronic disease. 
   As co-chair of the Women's Caucus, I am very proud of several bills that have been introduced and/or passed out during this Congress to address women's health issues. 
   Last year, we reauthorized the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program to provide low-income women with access to these essential screenings. 
   We also passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. And nearly every woman in the House is cosponsor of the Heart for Women Act, H.R. 1014, as well as H. Res. 1022 regarding maternal health. 
   But we are also fortunate to have a few good men, actually more than a few good men working with us, such as the ranking member on this bill, and Maurice Hinchey who has taken the lead by introducing this resolution for a few years now, along with Mary Bono Mack.     
   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution in the House today, and also to have a conversation with the women in their lives about what steps they can take to improve their health. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend we celebrated Mother's Day. I was fortunate enough to celebrate with my children and grandchildren. Sadly, many women never get the chance to celebrate this day with their family. 
   Throughout the world, a woman dies every single minute in childbirth. I think most of our congressional colleagues would be shocked to learn that this problem isn't faced by women in developing nations alone. The United States ranks 41st in the world, lower than all other industrialized nations, when it comes to maternal mortality. Let us use this opportunity, while Mother's Day is fresh in our minds, to renew our commitment to improving maternal health both at home and abroad. 
   I thank the 117 of our colleagues in the House of Representatives for cosponsoring House Resolution 1022, a resolution underscoring our challenges and urging us all to support the goal of a safe and healthy childbirth for every mother and baby here in the United States and all around the world.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CHARACTER COUNTS -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend and highlight the wonderful education framework called Character Counts. 
   I am very proud of the Santa Barbara YMCA and the Santa Barbara county education programs in my district that support this important framework which promotes civil responsibility through the following six pillars. 
   The first pillar is called ``trustworthiness.'' This program teaches children and young adults the value of reliability, honesty, loyalty and the courage to do the right thing. It is followed in sequence by a pillar named ``respect.'' 
   Respect encourages students to treat others with the same kind of tolerance of differences and consideration that they would wish to be treated themselves. It is never too early to begin to teach that framework that is centered around respect for one's self and respect for others. 
   The third pillar in the framework called Character Counts is titled ``responsibility,'' which teaches young people to consider the consequences of their actions and to be accountable for the choices that they make. Again, the earlier we can begin to both model and teach ways to make choices which lead to good consequences for a young person's life, the better the results can be for them and for those with whom they associate. 
   Then we have the pillar of Character Counts that is labeled ``fairness,'' and that is easy to see but it is hard to teach. It is taught by repetition on a playground, in a classroom, by following rules and understanding why rules are established, to be open-minded and not to take advantage of others, to learn to wait for one's turn. 
   Then we come to the pillar of responsibility called ``caring.'' Caring can be described in so many ways, but again, we learn to be caring individuals by seeing how others care for us and we begin to experience compassion, gratitude, forgiveness. These are behaviors that we want to repeat with young people over and over again until they become second-hand. 
   Finally, we come to the sixth pillar in this framework called Character Counts which is labeled ``citizenship.'' Here we teach students the merits of getting involved in making a community an environment, a place where they would want to live and be themselves and where they can see the benefits for those they care about. 
   Madam Speaker, last October I had a chance to see Character Counts firsthand in my district on two separate occasions. I attended the Fifth Annual Civic Mission of Schools Forum sponsored by the county schools office. I also was part of the Santa Barbara YMCA Character Counts event where each of these promoted these six pillars. 
   So I want to particularly thank Art Fisher for his dedication and his tireless work toward civic education at the Santa Barbara County Education Office. I know that the work he is doing to teach our children the value of responsibility, respect, honesty and compassion is remarkable. 
   I want also to highlight the work of Aaron Martinez at the Santa Barbara YMCA in promoting the very same program for children as young as 2 and 3 years old, stretching all the way through every age of life, which is what the YMCA is all about. 
   By promoting these six pillars of Character Counts, the YMCA gives our children, our young people, lifelong tools for success, and of course, our children will be the leaders of tomorrow. 
   So these lessons are invaluable, not just for them and for their day-to-day life but also for the future of our community and our society. 
   I told these young people as I listened to them describe these pillars that from what I have seen in Washington, D.C., and in the House of Representatives in the Congress, these principles of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship are absolutely necessary for making decisions affecting their lives and should be important for us to model here in the United States Congress ourselves. 
   I told them that I could envision these six pillars here on the floor of the House of Representatives, that we would say to ourselves every day that just as we want to teach these values to our young people we want to model them here. 
   We need to set the example in our own House to remind our children that character does count.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6331. The alternative to this bill is a 10 percent pay cut for doctors who serve critical seniors and those with disabilities. Our doctors are desperate for this. It is emergency care. It is a band-aid approach, but at least it will stop the bleeding. 
   Last year we had a much better package, the CHAMP Act, which we did debate on this floor and which we did vote out. It hit a roadblock in the other body and at the White House. This bill at least ensures our physicians can continue practicing in our communities and serving the Medicare population. 
   I do want to mention two important items, a cost saving provision which will improve services for the Medicaid beneficiaries by expanding the numbers of patients who can be covered by the county organized health systems in Ventura and other counties in California. This is a proven way to provide cost-effective access to quality health care, and it has been in place in my County of Santa Barbara for many years. 
   I also want to commend the inclusion of E-Prescribing language. I was proud to work on this with my colleagues ALLYSON SCHWARTZ and JON PORTER. E-Prescribing will ensure prescriptions are transmitted safely. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.

   And I speak from the perspective of a nurse who worked for many years with these women and their families in the community I'm from. Title X is our Nation's primary program to provide family planning services. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Title X has been so successful that for every public dollar invested in family planning, $3 are saved in Medicaid costs alone for pregnancy and newborn care. 
   In hundreds of communities across this country, the nonprofit Planned Parenthood is the major implementation of precisely the reproductive health care necessary to carry out effective family planning and to reduce unintended pregnancies. And they are contributing, these nonprofit organizations, to the successful implementation of Title X services. 
   So I urge my colleagues to stand for family values and to vote against this amendment so that you can protect your constituents' access to proven, effective family planning services which have as their goal to reduce unintended pregnancies.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and of our troops. The tragedy in Iraq has gone on far too long. For 4 years, this administration and its supporters have put forth arguments based on misinformation and fear. I would urge my colleagues to remember this during today's debate. 
   This administration and the Republican leadership in Congress have presided over perhaps the biggest foreign policy and national security blunder in our Nation's history. They have ignored, shouted down and attempted to intimidate anyone who has dared to disagree. 
   And now, after 4 years, we see the thousands of brave Americans killed or seriously injured, untold numbers of Iraqis dead and the country in chaos. 
   Our troops have done everything, and I mean everything, that has been asked of them. But they have been let down by the administration that dishonors their tremendous service and sacrifice with its incompetence and arrogance. 
   Let us, please, finally make a change in Iraq. Let us end the war and bring our troops home. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and support our troops.  
   I rise in strong support of this bill and of our troops. 
   The tragedy in Iraq has gone on far too long. 
   This legislation would bring our involvement there to an end. 
   I have listened now for more than 4 years as the administration and its supporters up here have come forward with one reason after another for: why we have to invade, why we have to stay, and what will happen if we ``fail.'' 
   They've never made sense to me. Their arguments have been based either on misinformation or fear. 
   The Bush administration has stumbled and bumbled, dissembled and distorted on Iraq so much that no one--no one--believes a word it says. 
   Last night, NBC News quoted a Republican Congressman telling the President that ``word about the war and its progress cannot come from the White House or even you, Mr. President. There is no longer any credibility.'' 
   That is the reality. 
   So I would urge my colleagues, as they listen to this debate and hear from the Republican leadership and White House why the McGovern bill or the Supplemental Appropriations bill are so wrong, to remember this history. 
   Mr. Speaker, this administration and the Republican leadership in Congress have presided over perhaps the biggest foreign policy and national security blunder in our Nation's history. They've ignored, shouted down and attempted to intimidate anyone who has dared disagree. 
   After 4 years we are left with thousands of brave Americans killed or seriously injured, an untold number of Iraqis dead, and the country in chaos. Most tragically, the cost for all these mistakes has been borne by the men and women who wear the uniform, and their families. 
   Our troops have done everything--everything--that has been asked of them. But they have been let down by an administration that dishonors their tremendous sacrifice with its incompetence and arrogance. 
   Let us please, finally, make a change in Iraq. Let us end the war and bring our troops home.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, what a privilege it is to join my colleagues today in paying tribute to our fellow Californian, the Honorable TOM LANTOS, who so wonderfully represented his constituents during his three decades in Congress. 
   As we know now, TOM LANTOS' journey from Hungary to the Halls of Congress was an extremely remarkable one. His life told the story of the fulfillment of the American Dream. He embodied that dream and, equally important, he knew not to take what America offered him for granted. 
   Even as he rose to leadership, he continued to champion the cause of human rights for oppressed people around the world, his signature issue. He was fiercely loyal to those attributes of this Nation, which had attracted him here to the country he chose to become a citizen of. 
   Who of us will forget TOM LANTOS' first action, becoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, holding some of his first hearings as chairman to address the human rights violations occurring today in Darfur? 
   By never forgetting his own roots, he became an advocate for all the lessons of humanity that we needed to learn from the experiences of the Holocaust, never forgetting that he served here as one who had survived that terrible tragedy and dedicated, as he was, to seeing that it would never reoccur. 
   He made sure that we all knew, and such a lesson I have, that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 
   I learned so much from my colleague, TOM LANTOS. I can just see him sitting in his regular spot there. So our heartfelt condolences are extended to Annette, to the children, to the 18 grandchildren, one of whom I had the privilege of hearing as she testified to our Health Subcommittee. Beautiful opera singer. TOM was so proud of her. Courageous enough to talk about her rare health condition. 
   We celebrate his life tonight dedicated to our commitment to not letting his many achievements go unforgotten.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (CITY OF OXNARD WATER RECYCLING AND DESALINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1737, the City of Oxnard Water Recycling and Desalination Act. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Rahall, and chairwoman or the Subcommittee on Water and Power, Mrs. Napolitano, as well as the ranking members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for expediting the consideration of this legislation and for bringing H.R. 1737 before us today. This bill was passed by the House of Representativ es last year but was never acted on by the Senate. 
   H.R. 1737 would authorize a proposed regional water resources project--the Groundwater Recovery Enhancement and Treatment or GREAT Program--located in my congressional district. As you know many communities today are faced with the difficult task of providing reliable and safe water to their customers. The City of Oxnard is no exception. 
   Oxnard is on of California's fastest growing cities and is facing an ever growing crisis: it's running out of affordable water. The water needs for the city's agricultural and industrial base, together with its growing pop ulation, has exceed its local water resources. As a result, over 50 percent of its water has to be Imported from outside sources. 
   However, through a series of local, state and federal restrictions the amount of imported water available to the city is shrinking, while the cost of that water is rising. Recognizing these challenges, Oxnard developed the GREAT Program to address its long term water needs. 
   The GREAT Program elements include: 
   A new regional groundwater desalination facility to serve potable water customers in Oxnard and adjacent communities; 
   A recycled water system to serve agricultural water users, and added protection against seaw ater intrusion and saltwater contamination; and 
   A wetlands restoration and enhancement component that efficiently reuses the brine discharges from both the groundwater desalination and recycled water treatment facilities. 
   Implementation of the GREAT Program will provide many significant regional benefits. 
   First, the new desalination project will serve ratepayers in Oxnard and adjacent communities, guaranteeing sufficient water supplies for the area. 
   Second, Oxnard's current water infrastructure delivers approximately 30 million gallons of treated wastewater per day to an ocean outfall. The GREAT Program will utilize the resource currently wasted to the ocean and treat it so that it can be reused by the agricultural water users in the area. 
   During the non-growing season, it will inject the resource into to the ground to serve as a barrier against seawater intrusion and saltwater contamination. To alleviate severely depressed groundwater levels, this component also includes pumping groundwater into the aquifer to enhance groundwater recharge. 
   Finally, the brine produced as a by-product of the desalination and recycling plants will provide a year-round supply of nutrient rich water to the existing wetlands at Ormond Beach. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the Natural Resources Committee for trying to find innovative and effective ways of extending water supplies in the West. In my view, the City of Oxnard Water Recycling and Desalination Act offers such a creative solution. It will reduce the consumption of groundwater for agricultural and industrial purposes, cut imported water delivery requirements, and improve local reliability of high quality water deliveries. 
   Again, I would like to thank the Natural Resources Committee for supporting this bill, and urge its immediate passage.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (SHORT-TERM ANALOG FLASH AND EMERGENCY READINESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3663, the Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act. 
   On February 18, 2009, full-power television stations in the United States will stop broadcasting in analog and transition to all-digital broadcasting. This is undoubtedly an important step forward for our country; it allows us to more efficiently utilize our airwaves, and to lay the groundwork for a nationwide public safety network. However, we must proceed with caution to ensure that segments of our population are not left behind and remain informed in cases of emergency. 
   That is why I introduced the SAFER Act. This bill creates a program within the FCC that allows for the continuation of analog signals to televisions for 30 days following the DTV transition. It ensures that, once the digital television transition has taken place, unprepared analog televisions will receive a short ``slide''--in English and Spanish--explaining that the digital transition has occurred and what viewers need to do to continue receiving television broadcasts. The bill also allows for emergency communications, such as natural disaster alerts, to be broadcast to unprepared analog televisions. The fires that raged through my congressional district and other parts of southern California last month are an example of alerts that could be broadcast to television viewers who were unprepared for the DTV transition. 
   According to the GAO, over 17 million households rely exclusively on analog over-the-air television, and while broadcasters, the FCC and others have been working furiously to let them know about the upcoming transition, there will inevitably be some folks left behind. In fact, that is exactly what happened after an FCC ``test'' transition in Wilmington, NC. Despite saturation advertising announcing the change and a geographic topography most conducive to it, nearly 2,000 households woke up to find that their televisions did not work; when extrapolated to the entire Nation this could mean that at least 1.5 million households will wake up on February 18 without a working television. 
   We also know that certain segments of our population will likely be disproportionately impacted by the digital transition: Latinos, African Americans, and seniors. As someone who represents a congressional district that is 42 percent Latino and has many senior citizens, I find this very troubling. Clearly, we should be doing everything we can to ensure that no Americans are left behind during this important time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague Senator Rockefeller and his staff for taking leadership on this important bill in the Senate, and to Chairman Dingell and his staff for working closely with us to ensure that no one is left behind by the DTV transition. 
   I urge my colleagues to support S. 3663, the Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act. 
   The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge swift action on a measure to improve women's access to health care. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, there is a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act which has unfortunately created a situation whereby student health centers and clinics that serve low-income women can no longer access contraceptives at a deeply discounted rate. 
   Just this week, I was proud to cosponsor a bill introduced by my colleagues JOE CROWLEY and JIM RAMSTAD to correct this inadvertent oversight. 
   The effects of this Deficit Reduction Act provision are already being felt by women across the country, including college students who are now forced to pay up to 10 times more for birth control pills than they did before. 
   Unfortunately, there are those who refuse to agree to our proposed correction. So I am standing here today to urge my colleagues to fix this discrepancy that was never intended to exist. 
   Let's stop the attacks on women's health. Let's guarantee women access to needed health services.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for recognizing me. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this fiscally responsible and morally sound budget resolution. I am especially proud that it prioritizes health care for our neediest children over tax breaks for our wealthiest few. 
   For the first time in my tenure in Congress, I feel we have a blueprint that invests in our future. I want to commend Chairman Spratt and my colleagues on the Budget Committee for including the necessary funds to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program to every child who qualifies. These are children of hardworking families. Low-income children and their families should have access to the same quality health care as everyone else, but the reality is that they don't. Under the President's budget, even more of them would have been cut off from SCHIP and Medicaid. 
   As a former school nurse, I can tell you that children without health care translates into children who do not receive primary care, who do not receive dental care, who are sent to school sick, who suffer from preventable illnesses. 
   I applaud the $50 billion investment into SCHIP because it is sure to bring us great returns, returns in the form of healthy, productive children. After all, that is what we have been sent here to do. I urge my colleagues to support this budget and support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Thank you, Chairman Dingell. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that today in the House of Representatives there is no one here who would dispute the fact that the large pharmaceutical companies have raked in record profits under the Medicare prescription drug plan we are currently seeking to improve. 
   Today, in this vote before us we are facing a clear choice. We can continue to reward these companies, or we can consider our constituents, our frail seniors, those with disabilities, many of whom are still struggling to make heads or tails out of Medicare part D that we seek to improve. 
   Common sense tells me that the big drug and insurance companies wouldn't be so adamantly opposed to this bill if they didn't fear that it would result in actual price reductions. Common sense also tells me we should take every possible step to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and this bill can achieve that. 
   There is precedent for the Federal Government obtaining good discounts for prescription drugs; our seniors know that, and they believe it. Don't be fooled into believing that this bill might somehow leave seniors losing access to important medications. The bill explicitly prohibits the government from establishing formularies. 
   It is going to also address one of the biggest challenges still facing our seniors, the fact that they have to decide every December which plan they will choose, hoping that it will offer the cheapest price for drugs that they are going to take for a whole year. The problem is that not everyone takes the same prescriptions from one January to the next; and reducing prices across the board will ensure that when a beneficiary's doctor changes their prescription halfway through the year, their new medication will also be available at a lower cost. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to think about our seniors, think about those with disabilities. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4. Fulfill a promise to serve the best interests of the constituents, not the best interest of profit-hungry big business.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, the intent of this motion to recommit is clear. 
   Upon adoption of this motion to recommit, we will go right to the adoption of the bill in its entirety to include the important language that ensures illegal immigrants are not benefitting from rental assistance provided by the section 8 program that is funded by the dollars of hard-working Americans. 
   The section 8 program has provided much needed rental assistance to low-income families who spend a high percentage of their income on housing costs since its creation in the 1970s. Today, there are approximately 2 million vouchers administered by the more than 2,500 public housing authorities in this country. The success of this program is now dominating HUD's budget, but we are looking for clear reform to ensure the viability of this program. 
   This motion to recommit helps strengthen the section 8 program by ensuring that illegal immigrants cannot receive assistance from this program. This measure will simply require all occupants of a housing unit, supported by section 8, to establish proof of their legal residency through the use of secure forms of identification. 
   There are four options here: driver's license or REAL ID card; a foreign or U.S. passport; a citizens and immigration services photo ID card; or a Social Security card in conjunction with the State or Federal photo ID. Without this addition to this bill, illegal immigrants could utilize current loopholes to secure section 8 housing benefits. 
   We absolutely cannot reward this illegal behavior with incentives for illegal immigrants to remain in the country in blatant violation of the law. By providing housing, we are simply encouraging the continuation of their illegal presence in our Nation. This is a form of back-door amnesty. 
   There have been many stories across the country highlighting examples of benefits being granted to illegal immigrants. I believe, in 2006, in Denver, Colorado alone, there were an estimated 20,000 illegal immigrants holding FHA ensured loans. Each of these cases provides further incentives for illegal immigrants to remain in our Nation violating the law. 
   Our Nation's immigration system is clearly broken. We must take this opportunity to strengthen a successful Federal program to ensure this benefit is only provided to legal residents. 
   The American people work too hard for their tax dollars to have them spent on illegal immigrants. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

President Bush's war in Iraq has been the biggest foreign policy catastrophe in our Nation's history. We have been distracted from doing the job in Afghanistan, the Nation that harbored al Qaeda. Hundreds of billions of dollars have evaporated into the sands of Iraq while vital needs have gone unmet at home. Our international reputation has been battered and bruised.

<DOCNO>Mrs. CAPPS. (PIEDRAS BLANCAS HISTORIC LIGHT STATION OUTSTANDING NATURAL AREA ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 276, the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station Outstanding Natural Area Act. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Rahall, and chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, Mr. Grijalva, as well as the ranking members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for expediting the consideration of this legislation and for bringing H.R. 276 before us today. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last year but was never acted on by the Senate. 
   H.R. 276 would designate the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station--located in my congressional district--as an Outstanding Natural Area within the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System. 
   The Piedras Blancas Light Station is located on an 18-acre parcel of BLM administered land along the Pacific Coast in San Luis Obispo County. The property is adjacent to Pacific Coast Highway and the Hearst Castle State Historic Monument, and it looks over a pristine coastal area that includes the southern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and California Coastal National Monument. It is also nationally recognized as an important monitoring point for migrating whales, and is used by the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Marine Fisheries Service and a number of universities and colleges for marine wildlife and plant research. 
   The Light Station and the surrounding area are also important for tourism. For example, the national historic Light House--built in 1879--is a main destination focal point on the central coast, and the peninsula is very popular for viewing sea otters, elephant seals, and sea lions from shore. The elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas attracts an estimated 400,000 visitors annually. 
   In 2001, BLM assumed ownership and management of the Light Station from the U.S. Coast Guard. Since then, BLM, State and local agencies, community stakeholders and conservation groups have developed a very successful partnership to preserve the Light Station. 
   Some of these partners include: the Piedras Blancas Light Station Association; California State Parks; San Luis Obispo County; the cities of Cambria and San Simeon; the California Coastal Conservancy and Coastal Commission; NOAA; and the Hearst Corporation. 
   As a result of their hard work, the site was re-opened to public tours in 2003--for the first time in 128 years. These partners continue to work together on a series of environmental education, 
   historical restoration and resource protection programs; and, I'm confidant they will each support and showcase this national designation if enacted. 
   My legislation tracks the successful model of designating the Oregon Coast's Yaquina Head as an Outstanding Natural Area, which was signed into law in 1980. Yaquina Head was later included in the National Landscape Conservation System. 
   Like Yaquina Head, the addition of the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the NLCS would be an important step in protecting and preserving this valuable natural and historic resource. It will also focus attention on the restoration of the Light Station and surrounding area, specifically the three on-site National Register properties; and, it will serve as a means to increase public awareness of the Light Station's scientific, cultural and educational values. 
   Specifically, H.R. 276 stresses long-term conservation of the Light Station by requiring timely completion of a management plan. The management plan would be developed through a public process and include guidelines for restoration of the National Register of Historic Places buildings, including the Light House; public access; ecological and cultural resource management; and, fostering scientific study and research opportunities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Piedras Blancas Light Station is a wonderful resource. It has the potential to serve as a model for future resource management, and therefore would be an appropriate addition to the BLM's National Landscape Conservation System. 
   Again, I would like to thank the Committee on Natural Resources for supporting this bill to designate Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station as an Outstanding Natural Area, and urge its immediate passage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Beach Protection Act. This bill will increase protections for the Nation's beaches and the public health. I commend Mr. Pallone, Mr. Bishop, and the Transportation Committee leadership for bringing this important bill to the floor in a bipartisan way. 
   Despite having one of the most comprehensive beach water quality testing  programs of all the coastal States, my home State of California has by far the most beach closures and advisories of all of the States. The State reported over 4,600 closing and advisory days statewide in 2006. 
   This legislation builds on the progress made since the passage of the BEACH Act in 2000 to reduce the number of these closures which threaten public health. 
   First, the legislation increases the funds available to the States, and expands the uses of those funds to include tracking the sources of pollution that cause beach closures, and supporting pollution-prevention efforts. 
   It will also require the EPA to develop methods for rapid testing of beach water, so results are available in hours, not days. 
   Second, the legislation strengthens the requirement for public notification of health risks posed by water contamination. These measures will improve the public's awareness of health risks posed by contamination of coastal waters and create additional tools for addressing the sources of pollution that cause beach closures, including leaking or overflowing sewer systems and storm water runoff. 
   I know some of my colleagues are trying to make this debate into one of energy and our economy. This is a bill to help protect the health of our beaches and the health of our economies. Safe and healthy beaches are strongly tied to our local economies. So I urge my colleagues not to be distracted by extraneous arguments. 
   Clean water is an economic and public health necessity for California and for all coastal States. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2537. Let's take good care of our beaches.

   Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1092. Colombia is an ally and a friend, and I commend President Uribe for reducing violence and unrest in Colombia. However, Colombia still leads the world in trade unionist murders. According to Human Rights Watch, 17 have been killed this year alone and more than 400 over the last 6 years. Hardly any of these murders have been investigated or prosecuted. 
   This is not only about human rights. This is about domestic responsibility. How can we trade away jobs when unemployment is climbing and our economy is in recession? We need to expand and strengthen trade adjustment assistance. We must educate and train American workers to better compete in the global economy. 
   The President had a choice. He chose to force a vote, and today he is getting that vote: a vote declaring that strong-arming Congress will not work, a vote for American workers and their families, a vote for human rights.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1092 and against the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. 
   Colombia is an ally and friend of the United States. I commend President Uribe and his government for reducing the violence and unrest in Colombia. They have made great progress. 
   However, Colombia still leads the world in trade unionist murders. According to Human Rights Watch, 17 have been killed this year alone, and more than 400 over the last six years. Hardly any of these murders have been investigated or prosecuted. 
   It would be immoral and irresponsible to pass a free trade agreement with Colombia while these conditions persist. But this is not only about human rights. This is about domestic responsibility. 
   How can we trade away jobs when unemployment is climbing and our economy sinks deeper into recession? Surely, this is not the time to rush into another trade agreement. Doing so without first strengthening our economy and helping American workers is just plain wrong. 
   The global economy is changing rapidly, and we need to catch up. We need to expand and strengthen Trade Adjustment Assistance. We need a Trade Adjustment Assistance program that educates and trains the American workforce to better compete in the global economy. 
   Yet the Administration and its allies on the Hill have expressed no interest in making this program meet the needs of American workers. Advancing free trade agreements without first addressing the needs of American workers is just plain irresponsible. 
   We are here today because the President has once again chosen confrontation over compromise. Like with FISA, the Iraq War and countless other important issues, the President has determined that he alone knows what's best and that Congress and everyone else should just go along. Of course, his disastrous record over the last 7 years--on the economy, jobs, the deficit, health care, disaster relief and our national security, to name just a few issues--should make any fair observer pause before deferring to his judgment. By unilaterally forcing this issue, the President has yet again demonstrated his arrogant disregard for American workers and their families. 
   The President had a choice. He chose to force a vote, and today he is getting that vote. This vote will declare that strong-arming Congress will not work. This vote will be a vote for human rights. This vote will be a vote for American workers and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and stand up for working families both here at home and in Colombia.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. CAPPS. Today, I rise to speak about global poverty, and specifically to share my experiences as part of the House Democracy Assistance Commission Congressional Delegation visit recently to six African countries. This Commission supports the development of Democratic governments around the world by establishing peer-to-peer relationships with emerging Democratic legislatures. 
   There is one striking feature in most of the nations we visited on this trip, and they included Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Liberia. In each of these countries, at least half of the population lives on less than $2 a day. 
   You know, in so much of the Continent of Africa, a continent vibrant and rich with resources and wonderful people, it's overwhelming to see up close and in very personal ways the fact that adults regularly die from preventible disease and children so horribly malnourished. 
   In fact, according to UNICEF, even in today's modern world, with all the technology that is available, over 26,000 children under the age of five die every single day due to poverty. Just think of it. Twenty-six thousand lives lost each day. 
   This number, more than any other, brings home to me with cruel immediacy the absolute desperate needs of the world's poor. As we know, poverty is not only the result of economic and social policy shortcomings, it also thrives on war. This scourge is the means by which incredible gender and minority inequality flourishes. 
   I am thinking now of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo who, even as we speak, are enduring unspeakable acts of sexual violence and degradation. The lives of so many of the world's people are horribly short and difficult because we have all failed to properly distribute the abundant resources of Mother Earth. 
   These facts are reprehensible and would seem to leave us without hope in the future. But wherever poverty may have taken hold in Africa, it has failed to take hold of the African spirit. 
   In Malawi, a country where 62 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day, and where an estimated 15 percent of the adult population is HIV positive, we visited health programs that are a tribute to what is possible when we unite to help each other. 
   As a nurse, I took special note of our visits to orphan and health care programs run by the Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance, as well as Direct Relief International. These are local, nonprofit agencies that are supported directly by many constituents of mine in my congressional district, and I was honored and humbled to see where these gifts of my friends and neighbors at home, where these gifts are being used so fruitfully in these countries to support and nurture and nourish the lives of orphan children and women suffering with HIV and AIDS. 
   From HIV prevention, school tuition, and transport to pediatric HIV treatment centers, as well as caring for the ill, these organizations, and there are many of them, and the incredible people that work for them and with them, are helping to bring change to the lives of Malawian children and families. 
   The African spirit was also thriving in countries like Kenya and Liberia, both of which are working very hard to maintain and strengthen their Democratic institutions, countries where we enjoyed democracy building with their parliaments. It was a team effort. And it was a real honor, again, to be there on behalf of our U.S. Congress. 
   It will not be easy to turn the tide of poverty in Africa. But, working together, progress is being made. I implore my colleagues to keep this continent, the cradle of life, at the forefront of our minds on this House floor.

   Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I thank the chairwoman of the Foreign Operations Committee for her leadership in this area. 
   My life has been devoted to public health, to bettering it. And this amendment is bad public policy wherever it will affect lives. It forces, actually, bad public health policy and re moves the flexibility to opt for better allocation of public health services. 
   PEPFAR is extremely important to our fight against the transmission of HIV/AIDS and our treatment of the 40 million people living worldwide with this disease. But as the Institutes of Medicine and GAO have both reported, country teams have been greatly limited in their ability to provide effective lifesaving services by the restriction  that has been placed for the past several years. 
   I applaud Chairwoman Lowey for lifting this restriction by allowing PEPFAR funds to be spent where they are actually needed in order to accomplish the program's goal. 
   We spent all last week listening to complaints about a lack of responsible spending. Quite frankly, making the amount of funds available for proven effective public health programs dependent upon spending for unproven, ineffective programs is the epitome of irresponsible spending. 
   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, to support responsibility.
