<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (WELCOMING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM INDONESIA, KENYA, MACEDONIA, AND UKRAINE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Here in the gallery today are 23 members of Parliament from Indonesia, Kenya, Macedonia, and Ukraine. They are visiting the House of Representatives this week as guests of the House Democracy Assistance Commission. HDAC, chaired by Representative DAVID PRICE, partners with legislative bodies in 12 countries. They are each moving steadily towards democratic governance. The four countries represented here today are among the most promising participants in this important congressional initiative. 
   The MPs, many of whom are committee chairs, will work directly with Members of Congress to learn how we conduct committee business in the U.S. House. They will take this information back to their respective legislatures and use these concepts and procedures to strengthen their legislative process and, as a result, strengthen their democracy. 
   I ask that the House give these distinguished guests a warm welcome and offer our strong encouragement for the work that we are doing together. By building relationships with our fellow parliamentarians in emerging democracies and sharing their aspirations for their future, we can promote the safety and security of our own Nation and encourage stability around the world.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, after all the loss of life, personal sacrifice and billions of taxpayer dollars, the President still does not have a plan for securing the peace in Iraq and bringing our troops home. 
   After the continued failure of the Iraqi Government to make progress on political, social and economic benchmarks, the President chooses to stay the course in Iraq. After nearly 4 1/2 years, Iraq remains politically unstable and tragically violent. 
   Instead of changing course and offering a viable plan to conclude America's military involvement, the President calls for an open-ended commitment to keeping our troops in Iraq for years to come. It is time to demand a new direction for Iraq, to focus our military on combating and defeating terrorism, to insist on a comprehensive diplomatic strategy to move the Iraqi Government toward national reconciliation, and to bring our troops home. 
   This Congress stands by our troops. They've performed with great honor and they've accomplished all that we have asked them to do. It is time to bring them home. 
   Vote ``yes'' to demand a redeployment plan. Vote ``yes'' to demand accountability from this President to bring our troops home from Iraq safely and responsibly.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Energy Independence and Security Act before us later today. This landmark energy bill moves our Nation forward towards a new, brighter energy future. It promotes clean homegrown energy by requiring our utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from renewable energy by 2020. It reduces our dependence on foreign oil by raising fuel efficiency standards on our cars by 40 percent. With the price of oil nearing $100 per barrel, this will save consumers billions of dollars. And it saves energy through energy-efficiency standards and incentives like the effort I led to promote the construction of energy-efficient commercial buildings. 
   These policies will create new jobs and build new American industries, while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. And it is all paid for by reclaiming $21 billion in taxpayer subsidies from the oil and gas industry. 
   I urge support of this fiscally responsible, smart new energy policy that embraces American ingenuity, innovation, and leadership and moves America forward towards a cleaner, more secure future.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as the co-Chair of the Congressional Georgia Caucus, I rise in support of House Resolution 1166 and to express my strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia. 
   On April 16, 2008, the Russian Government declared that it would establish legal and official ties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to extend these regions, which are part of the sovereign nation of Georgia. This action was denounced by the international community, including the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, better known as NATO to all of us. Nonetheless, Russia remained unfazed by international opinion and further escalated tensions in the region just 4 days later by shooting down a Georgian unmanned aerial drone over Georgian territory. 
   Georgia is one of the strongest allies in the Caucasus region, and it is important for the United States to continue to stand by our allies. I spoke with President Saakashvili on Thursday, and he's very concerned about the situation and, as was mentioned by previous speakers, has offered a number of peace proposals. But he very much appreciates the statements that were made in support of Georgia by our State Department and is grateful for this resolution and the strong bipartisan support it demonstrates from Congress. 
   Since speaking with the President last week, the situation has become even more difficult for Georgia. The Russian Federation continues to move troops into Abkhazia, and yesterday we heard reports of possibly two more Georgian aircraft being shot down. 
   Considering our close relationship with Georgia, it is appropriate that the House of Representatives join the international institutions that have condemned Russia's actions and called for a peaceful resolution to the current tensions in the region. This resolution is supported by the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who were original cosponsors of the resolution. And it was introduced by Representative Wexler, the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution and appreciate its bipartisan nature.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as one of the original architects of CHIP in Pennsylvania, I have seen firsthand that it is possible to bring together public and private stakeholders and expand health coverage to millions of children, children of working families who cannot afford the increasing cost of coverage. 
   As the September 30 deadline to reauthorize CHIP quickly approaches, American families are counting on us to ensure health coverage for millions of American children. 
   The Democratic majority understands the needs of working families and has negotiated for weeks to craft a commonsense compromise legislation before us. This plan has a broad-based coalition of supporters ranging from our Nation's seniors and unions and businesses, insurance companies and health care providers, all of whom have come together to support CHIP.  
   American families expect action, and 10 million uninsured American children are depending on us. It is time to put children ahead of politics. Vote ``yes.'' Vote for America's children. Tell the President to end his veto threats and vote to make health coverage available and affordable to 10 million American children.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   My own State, Pennsylvania, is in the forefront of science and medicine. Our hospitals, medical schools, biotechnology and pharmaceutical institutions are home to some of the best and brightest scientists who are working every day to provide new medicines and diagnostics. These scientists need access to all of the tools available to do their vitally important work. 
   The science is clear. Stem cell research offers hope for better treatments and possible cures for cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries and so many other debilitating diseases and disorders that directly affect 100 million Americans and their families. 
   Yet President Bush continues to let politics, not science, not the health and well-being of American families, and not the will of the majority of Americans dictate his decision-making. 
   American families want cures, not politics. They want hope, not lost opportunities. That is why it is so important that we are, again, bringing this proposal to the floor of Congress. 
   Today, with bipartisan support, Congress will again seek to offer hope to millions of Americans battling disease and injury. Today, Congress will, once again, vote to maintain the United States' stance as a world leader in medical research and scientific advancement. And today, we will stand up to the President and, again, choose to advance scientific discovery in an ethical and responsible manner. 
   I urge my colleagues to support ethical scientific research and to support hope. We should vote ``yes'' on this rule. We should vote ``yes'' on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution supports the goals and ideals of National Save for Retirement Week which will soon be designated by the Senate as October 21 through October 27, 2007. I want to thank Senators Conrad and Smith for working with me and my esteemed colleague, Mr. Johnson of Texas, to bring attention to the importance of retirement planning for American families. 
   We are living in a time when workers are being asked to shoulder an increasing share of the cost of savings for retirement. Even with an employee-sponsored retirement plan and the promise of Social Security benefits, American families need to put additional money aside to ensure a financially secure retirement. For many American families, saving is becoming an increasingly difficult task as they struggle to meet their everyday obligations. Even in solidly middle income families, financial resources are stretched thin as parents work to meet other pressing needs, whether it is purchasing health care coverage, paying for college, meeting energy costs, or simply paying monthly bills on time. 
   Over the past several years, we have seen a dramatic shift in our retirement system. Most workers are no longer eligible for traditional pensions which provide a predictable monthly benefit throughout retirement. Instead, workers are now bearing more of the costs and investment risks of saving adequately for their retirement under defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s. 
   As a result, the value of most workers' retirement benefits and the security of their retirement is now directly linked to their investment decisions and the balance held in their account when they retire rather than their years of service. 
   The dramatic shift towards individual defined contribution plans is clear. In 1980, there were over 148,000 defined benefit plans that provided guaranteed benefits to workers, and there were approximately 341,000 defined contribution plans that relied on the returns on investments made by workers. By 2003, just over 20 years later, the number of defined benefit plans had fallen to just about 47,000, while the number of defined contribution plans had risen to nearly 653,000. 
   While this shift is empowering American workers to make more of their own financial decisions, many families are finding it difficult to save significantly to meet all of their retirement needs. 
   A study conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute shows that average 401(k) balances range from approximately $4,500 for participants in their 20s with less than 3 years of service to just under $200,000 for participants in their 60s with at least 30 years of service. 
   Unfortunately, a balance of less than $200,000 may not be enough to finance an individual's retirement years. For example, a worker in my own State of Pennsylvania with a $200,000 balance who makes the financially prudent decision of purchasing an annuity could expect a maximum monthly benefit of about $1,300. $1,300 can go just so far in meeting monthly household expenses. Retirees have to ask can $1,300 pay their mortgage, health costs, car payments, gas and leisure activities, and will it be sufficient in 5, 10 or 15 years given the increasing cost of living to meet their expenses and their expectations for retirement? 
   These concerns become more alarming as recent data show a decline in actual worker participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. In 2004, only 40 percent of families had an individual who participated in either form of employer-based plan. This means that a majority of American working families are not currently participating in any retirement plan at work. 
   As our country shifts towards an increasing reliance on individual savings, workers are facing increased difficulty as they prepare for retirement. And it heightens the importance of educating our workers about the pressing need to save. 
   In my district, I have partnered with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to host seminars to help provide families with the information they need to make educated, financially responsible decisions about their family budgets and to help them establish a habit of saving for the future.     
   I have also worked with schools in my district to help reach out to children, even at young ages, in order to emphasize the importance of saving for the future. It is never too early to learn that every little bit we save now will help in the long run. Whether you're a 16-year-old receiving your first paycheck or a 25-year-old getting your first real increase, or a 45-year-old with a mortgage and two kids who need braces, a habit of putting a little bit away each month in regular savings can, with the help of compound interest, add up to a secure retirement. The resolution before us today supports and encourages educational opportunities on a national scale and creates a collaborative effort to emphasize the importance of making saving for retirement a priority for all American families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution so that we can help make American workers more financially secure in their retirement years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CLEAN Energy Act. This plan will lead the Nation in a new direction on energy policy. 
   The United States imports 65 percent of the oil we consume. We spend $800 million every day on foreign oil-producing countries. This threatens our economic stability, our environmental security, and our national security. And today we say, enough. 
   Today we roll back the Republican-led Congress's giveaways to the oil industry. We stop rewarding the oil companies with taxpayer dollars; and, instead, we start to turn our attention to energy independence in this country. 
   We will invest the revenues, $14 billion, to put this Nation on the path to energy independence and environmental security. We will reduce our energy consumption by encouraging the development and construction of energy-efficient buildings and consumer appliances and motor vehicles; and, most importantly, we will advance our energy independence by using these revenues to research. We are going to use this money to research and develop and bring to market the alternative sources of energy for a safer, cleaner, cheaper and American-made energy alternatives. We set this country in a new direction. 
   I wholeheartedly encourage a ``yes'' vote in doing that today on the floor of Congress.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (ESTABLISHING THE HOUSE DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE COMMISSION FOR THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Thank you, Mr. Lantos. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the floor this afternoon. 
   Madam Speaker, I was honored to serve on the House Democracy Assistance Commission during the 109th Congress, and I was privileged to travel on the commission's first trip to Indonesia and East Timor in February of 2006. I too want to thank the commission's chairman, Congressman DAVID PRICE, and the ranking member, former chairman, Congressman DAVID DREIER, for their hard work and their leadership on this important initiative. 
   I also want to acknowledge the commission's staff, John Lis, in particular,  the director, and the rest of the staff who worked hard in advance of our trips and continued to work hard in preparing for the designation of certain emerging democracies and our trips abroad as well to bring some of those members here. 
   The last few years have borne witness to a number of encouraging events in emerging democracies around the world, as well as a number of discouraging setbacks. One thing that has become clear is that to help advance democracy, transparency and the rule of law abroad, the United States can and must do more than just support elections. We must support the establishment of strong, independent democratic institutions, which provide the backbone of viable democracy. So in addition to elected executives, we must, and indeed it means, help legislative and judicial branches of government have the authority, the autonomy and the continuity that they need. 
   As Members of Congress, Members of the oldest directly representative democratic institution in the world, we are in a unique position to reach out to our counterparts in fragile democracies to held build relationships and to learn from each other. 
   The House Democracy Assistance Commission has conducted legislative strengthening programs with our counterparts in Indonesia, East Timor, Georgia, Macedonia, Kenya and Afghanistan; and these legislators face enormous challenges. For instance, in East Timor, where I traveled, only two of their legislators had legislative experience prior to serving in their parliament. They have almost no support staff and few resources. 
   Their constitution provides for a substantive parliamentary role; however, lack of experience and lack of infrastructure have severely limited their role, leaving the executive to control most of their legislation. Nonetheless, the members that we met with are deeply committed to their role as representatives and to their role in maintaining and building democratic institutions. 
   They are keenly aware of the challenges that they face as one of the poorest nations in the world, where basic services from electricity to schools are just being initiated. It is in our Nation's interest to work with nations like East Timor, nations struggling on the road to democracy and stability to establish effective legislative bodies. 
   The commission enables Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans alike, to do just that, to share our knowledge, expertise and passion for the legislative branch with our counterparts in these emerging democracies. 
   We have worked with parliamentarians from these countries in their home countries, in State capitals across this country and here in Washington, focusing on the establishment of legislative information and research services, on providing advice on legislative procedures and committee operations, and on constituent services. 
   The commission has also provided these parliaments with some needed material support, such as office equipment and computers and library resources. So as we confront the global security challenges of the 21st century, initiatives that strengthen democratic institutions abroad and help provide a positive image of the United States are of utmost importance. That is why this commission is so worthy of our continued support. That is why I urge a ``yes'' vote on House Resolution 24.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his kind words. 
   I rise in strong support of the Peru Free Trade Agreement which passed the Ways and Means Committee with an impressive unanimous vote. This agreement represents a new direction for trade policy in the United States. 
   For the first time, the trade agreement before us includes fully enforceable labor and environmental standards. The lack of these standards was exactly why many Democrats, including myself, opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement in 2005. 
   Inclusion of such standards is a significant achievement and will mean better working conditions for Peruvian workers, a cleaner environment in Peru, and expanded economic opportunity for both of our countries. 
   That is why so many organizations who were previously opposed to bilateral trade agreements have praised the Peru FTA. For instance, the AFL-CIO called the Peru FTA, ``an important step toward a trade model that will benefit working people.'' 
   The United Auto Workers said the agreement represents, ``substantial progresses in achieving this long-standing objective of the labor movement.'' 
   Chairman Rangel and Chairman Levin did remarkable work to advance a new kind of trade agreement. I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish to further this agreement when the three of us traveled to Peru in August and met with Peruvian President Alan Garcia. 
   President Garcia is a true friend of the United States. Building a strong economic relationship with Peru will also build a stronger political and diplomatic relationship with this important ally in Latin America. 
   Every Member who votes for this agreement can feel proud that they've supported a trade agreement that represents the interests of Americans. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this agreement. It's pro-worker, it's pro-business development, and it's pro-environment. It is a new kind of trade agreement for the United States. Vote for the trade agreement with Peru.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, as the American people have witnessed over the past several days, the instability in the financial markets requires immediate attention. 
   The longer this instability continues, the harder it will be for employers to meet payroll, for retirement plans to meet their obligation to retirees, and for families to access the credit they need to pay for college, for a car, for a home, or for just getting by. 
   The road has been difficult, but the risk posed to everyday Americans is simply too great not to act. 
   My constituents and I were appalled when President Bush asked us to hand over $700 billion with no oversight, no accountability, and no reforms to the fundamentally flawed policies that allowed this crisis to occur. 
   Due to bipartisan cooperation--and now compromise between the Senate and the House of Representatives--this economic recovery proposal is fundamentally different than the proposal first brought to us by President Bush. 
   Today, we have an economic recovery proposal before us that will protect the interests of hardworking Americans by: 
   Restoring investor confidence in our economy and the financial markets; 
   Protecting taxpayers by requiring full transparency of actions taken by the Treasury Secretary, creating a strong oversight board appointed by Congress, and establishing an independent Inspector General to guarantee compliance; 
   Ensuring fiscal responsibility by making resources available in installments that require congressional and Presidential approval, and guaranteeing that the financial services industry repays any losses to the U.S. Treasury; 
   Helping distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure by facilitating loan modifications; and 
   Limiting the compensation for the corporate executives that created this crisis by eliminating multimillion dollar golden parachutes. 
   I will vote for the proposal before us today because I believe that the current economic crisis requires action by Congress. 
   It is unfortunate that the Senate took this opportunity to add unrelated measures to this bill. 
   These measures include items that I have strongly supported--such as: mental health parity; Alternative Minimum Tax relief; property tax relief; the personal deduction for higher education expenses; incentives for energy  conservation and the development of alternative and renewable energy; and the extension of current tax policies that encourage innovation and help U.S. companies compete internationally. 
   I support these proposals and I appreciate that they will become law by our action today. But, I believe that we should have--and could have--covered the cost of these provisions, had the Senate not acted first. 
   It is also embarrassing that just a few Senators would use this critical economic recovery proposal to enact narrowly targeted tax benefits--risking passage and angering American taxpayers who have rightfully called for reform of such practices 
   Nonetheless, action is required to stabilize our financial markets. We must begin the process of economic recovery by making credit and capital available to families and businesses of all sizes to meet their obligations and move this country forward. 
   There is still more to do. We must focus on the regulation of our financial markets, strong enforcement, and sound fiscal policies in Government and in the private sector that are all necessary to restore our economy to one of prosperity, opportunity and growth--not just for a few--but for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support for the Small Businesses Investment Expansion Act and to commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this issue. In particular, I appreciate his work to include a provision that modernizes the definition of a small business. 
   In today's economy, there are many small companies entering high technology, capital-intensive industries that require significant investment to bring their products to market. I have seen this firsthand in my home State of Pennsylvania, which is a national leader in biotechnology initiatives. The biosciences have had a significant economic impact on Pennsylvania's economy with more than 125 biopharmaceutical companies and 2,000 bioscience-related companies calling the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania their home. These companies are developing groundbreaking therapy, devices, diagnostics and vaccines that really will treat once-untreatable diseases and debilitating conditions, providing hope for millions of people. 
   But developing new cures is not cheap. It often takes 10 years or more and costs hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a new treatment to market. This means that new bioscience companies can experience years of large cash outlays before they have the opportunity to cover their costs and repay their loans, let alone realize any profit. 
   As the author of a comprehensive proposal, the American Life Sciences Competitiveness Act, I have identified a number of actions that this Congress can and I hope will take to improve access to capital for this life-saving research and product development. 
   I am pleased to lend my support to this bill before us today that would correct the outdated SBA regulations that currently preclude these small businesses, even those with only a handful of employees, from receiving assistance because they rely on venture capital to fund their work. It is time to enable these American small businesses, which are such a vital part of our Nation's economic growth, to compete for Federal grants and other small business assistance so they may pursue cutting-edge technologies and products that will benefit us all.

   Now my constituents and hard working families across this country are rightfully concerned about what this all means to them. 
   Let us be clear--it is the Bush policies of deregulation, non-existent oversight, disregard for our nation's infrastructure, irresponsible tax policies, and excessive deficit spending that exploded our national debt and lead us into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
   The action we take today is difficult, but it is the responsible one. The potential downside for everyday Americans is simply too great not to act. 
   The instability in the financial markets creates serious difficulty for every company seeking to meet payroll, every retirement plan seeking to meet their obligation to retirees, and every family who needs to borrow money for a car, for college, for a home, or for just getting by. 
   My constituents want to trust Washington to do the right thing to turn the economy around, but they want us to protect their interests and address their everyday concerns. 
   That is why the American people and members of Congress were appalled when President Bush asked us to hand over $700 billion with no oversight, no accountability, and no reforms to the fundamentally flawed policies that allowed this crisis to occur. 
   Because of Democratic leadership, this economic recovery proposal is fundamentally different than the proposal first brought to us by President Bush.

   Responsible action to stabilize our economy is required and warrants bipartisan support. But, efforts to rebuild our economy cannot stop here. 
   Moving forward we must focus on the regulation of our financial markets, strong enforcement, and sound fiscal policies in government and in the private sector that are all necessary to restore the economy to one of prosperity, opportunity and growth--not just for a few--but for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (THE PRESIDENT'S ENERGY PROPOSAL -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, last year U.S. foreign oil imports climbed to a record level of 66 percent. American families are paying a record $3.09 a gallon on average for regular gasoline, more than double the cost of gasoline when President Bush took office. 
   For 6 years now, the President has failed to address these costs or our Nation's energy needs. 
   Yesterday, under pressure to finally do something, President Bush announced an executive order to develop regulations to lower vehicle emissions before he leaves office in 2009. 
   This is too little, too late. The administration has had 6 years to act, and they have failed. They failed to address the energy concerns of our Nation while giving big tax breaks to the oil and gas industry. 
   Fortunately, we have a new Democratic Congress that is going to lead our Nation towards energy independence. We are determined to find ways to be more energy efficient, to bring new, safer, less expensive, homegrown sources of energy to American families and American businesses, and we will start now by bringing a comprehensive energy bill to the House floor in July that will drive down costs and meet our Nation's future energy needs.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. 
   The United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil, yet only holds 2 percent of the world's oil reserve. The fact is that we cannot simply drill our way out of this energy crisis, but that's exactly what Republicans would lead you to believe, that drilling is the answer. But it is simply shortsighted, misleading, and wrong. 
   We can drill responsibly, but lower gas prices and energy independence require immediate and significant investments in American innovation in alternative fuels, investments in renewable energy technology, and in energy efficiency. 
   The Republicans say that they want an all-of-the-above plan. Well, that's exactly what we have before us today. This proposal is a 21st-century energy plan that spurs innovation, puts the Nation on a path to energy independence, and lowers gas prices for American families and American businesses. 
   It will expand renewable energy production and improve energy efficiency through $18 billion in tax incentives paid for by repealing subsidies to the oil industry. It will promote conservation by encouraging the construction of commercial buildings that are 50 percent more energy efficient. It will increase domestic production of traditional energy sources by allowing new offshore drilling. And it will create hundreds of thousands of new high-quality, good-paying American jobs. 
   This plan is a stark contrast to the Republicans' drill-only mantra. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to vote for an all-of-the-above approach, this is their chance. Vote for a uniquely American solution to our security and to America's energy future.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to welcome Reverend Martin Lavengood and to thank him for the prayer he just delivered, and to welcome his family and many residents of the Evangelical Manor who are here today. 
   Reverend Lavengood has a long and honorable history of service to the community. Prior to being ordained in 1991, Reverend Lavengood taught high school English in New York. Shortly after his ordination, he studied in Jerusalem as the first Roberta Rudin Scholar for Jewish-Christian Studies. After his experience in Israel, the reverend returned to the United States and became active in prison ministry while serving in parishes in New York and Indiana. 
   In 2003, Reverend Lavengood moved to Philadelphia where he became a chaplain at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. While working there, he developed an interest in ministering to people of all ages, especially the elderly. This interest led him to his current position as chaplain of the Wesley Enhanced Living at Evangelical Manor in Philadelphia, where he's honored, he says, to serve members of the World War II generation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise as co-chair of the Congressional Georgia Caucus, and I rise in favor of House Resolution 997 which expresses support for extending NATO membership action plan status to Georgia and Ukraine. 
   I do thank Chairman Berman and Congressman Wexler for their leadership in this bipartisan effort to support Georgia and Ukraine in their entrance into NATO. 
   As leading democratic reformers in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Georgia are both worthy of advancing their participation in NATO from ``intensified dialogue'' to membership action plan, MAP, status during the Bucharest Summit. This is an important and timely next step toward the goal of becoming full members of NATO. 
   Both of these nations are keenly interested in joining NATO and working closely with Western allies. They have already demonstrated this by actively participating in both U.S. and NATO forces. More than 2,000 Georgian soldiers currently serve alongside U.S. military personnel in Iraq, making it the third largest coalition partner. And Ukraine is the only nonmember state taking an active role in all of NATO's peacekeeping and anti-terrorist operations. 
   As a member of the House Democracy Assistance Commission, I had the great pleasure and opportunity to meet both Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Ukrainian President Yushchenko in their home capitals. Their commitment to democratization in their respective nations is impressive, and is an important example for other emerging democracies around the world. 
   Certainly both nations have work to do to stabilize and ensure development of permanent democratic institutions. Yet, as recently established democracies changing a history of totalitarian rule, they are making enormous strides. They are ready to be granted MAP and be given the opportunity to work toward full NATO membership. 
   In a world with real threats against us, it is critically important that we strengthen relationships with those nations that choose to be our allies. Georgia and Ukraine are key allies in an important region of the world. We should stand with our friends. We should stand with Georgia and Ukraine, and we should pass this resolution today.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to directly address the concerns of a community in my district that is impacted by BRAC 2005. 
   The BRAC Commission's recommendations related to the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove call for a significant continued presence of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard and other military units and for maintenance of the airfield for their use. 
   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is currently working with DOD to transform Willow Grove into a Joint Interagency Operation Installation dedicated to national defense, homeland security, and emergency preparedness. This effort is supported by Federal, State, and local leaders of both parties, including the Governor and both U.S. Senators. 
   Despite the outpouring of local support for the base and a unified voice which we are supporting for continued military presence at the base, there remains a significant concern in the community that the base could be used for commercial passenger and cargo operations. 
   My amendment, jointly with Patrick Murphy, my colleague from Pennsylvania, which was drafted in coordination with Pennsylvania's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, would address this local concern and strengthen the future capabilities of the base by codifying what Governor Rendell and bipartisan elected officials at all levels of government have been saying all along: Willow Grove will not become a commercial cargo or passenger airport. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this body will vote on the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   After 4 years of failed policies from the Bush administration, and absolutely no accountability demanded by the previous Republican-led Congresses, this body has the opportunity to say enough. We say enough to continuing the open-ended war with no end in sight. We say enough to giving away hard-earned taxpayer dollars to the Iraqi Government without any real mechanisms for accountability. We say enough to ignoring the will of the American people who have overwhelmingly demanded a new direction and a new course in Iraq. 
   This week the Iraq war will enter its fifth year. It has already eclipsed the length of the U.S. participation in the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. More than 3,200 American heroes have paid the ultimate sacrifice, while more than 24,000 have been injured, and tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed, just as millions have been fleeing the country. 
   Despite this immense sacrifice and hardship, the President's war strategy has not made the Middle East or our Nation safer. 
   Today the Middle East is less stable than it was in 2003. An Iraq in chaos and an emboldened Iran has fundamentally changed the balance of power in the region in a way that undermines the security of our Nation and the entire region. The war has caused us to lose sight of the mission in Afghanistan where the Taliban is resurgent and Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, and other key members of al Qaeda, the terrorist group responsible for killing 3,000 Americans on 9/11, are still at large and still plotting against us. 
   Our own National Intelligence Estimate tells us that the war in Iraq estimate has increased, and the threat of terrorism globally has increased. 
   Just 2 weeks ago, I visited Iraq, and I met with the brave servicemen and -women. I deeply admire these individuals and their families. Out of pure selflessness and a profound love of our Nation, they have volunteered to serve. They do so humbly and honorably. 
   The Bush administration owes them a strategy that is worthy of their sacrifice. When they failed to provide it, we must hold them accountable. Our Nation can no longer afford the failed policies put forward by President Bush. 
   We must step forward, abandon the rubber-stamp policies of the previous Congress, and reassert our place as a coequal branch of government. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to meet this obligation and put the administration on notice. The days of writing a blank check for the mistaken and mismanaged war are over. 
   When we send our men and women into Iraq without the proper equipment, training and rest, as the President continues to, we expose them to greater danger. This legislation we will vote on tomorrow recognizes this fact by requiring the President to honor his own standards and the standards the Department of Defense has set for the troop readiness, training and equipment. 
   When our own wounded warriors return to the United States, we as a Nation have an obligation to ensure that they are taken care of. There is simply no excuse for the deplorable conditions of neglect that our soldiers have faced at Walter Reed medical center. That is a national disgrace. 
   This legislation addresses our veterans health care crisis by adding $1.7 billion to treat the growing number of veterans, to address the maintenance backlogs at the VA health care facilities, and to ensure a significant level of personnel to deliver quality services. This legislation recognizes that the only solution in Iraq is political and diplomatic. 
   As General Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq, has said: ``There was no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq.'' 
   This legislation will hold the Iraqi Government accountable by requiring them to meet their own benchmarks for political progress. 
   We are putting them on notice that they must take the political steps necessary to achieve stability, including disarming the militia and a plan that equally shares oil revenues around the country. 
   We are also sending a strong clear message to the Bush administration that they must engage in tough diplomacy needed to ensure that Iraq's neighbors do not continue to undermine the efforts of our troops or they undermine the hope for stability in Iraq. 
   Most significantly, this legislation will lead to the responsible end of our military engagement in Iraq through a phased redeployment of U.S. combat troops. 
   Instead of continuing the President's policy of open-ended commitment, strategically redeploying combat troops from Iraq, while maintaining a small presence to train Iraqi troops and engage in counterterrorism operations is the most responsible strategy in Iraq. 
   We will move our troops from direct engagement. It will require the Iraqis to protect Iraqis, and it will allow our Nation to be better prepared for other contingencies affecting the security of our Nation.  
   Let there be no mistake: this is the President's war, and the President must be held accountable for its military and diplomatic failures. With this vote, we are demanding that the President meet his obligations to our men and our women and to our Nation.  
   With this vote, we are fulfilling our promise to the American people that we set a new direction in Iraq. 
   And, with this vote we are putting forward the leadership needed to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible conclusion and bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, let me say I'm strongly supportive of the underlying bill that we are debating today. I think it moves us forward toward energy independence. It's exciting for all American businesses, for conservation, for energy efficiency and for the future of this country and this world. 
   My amendment is fairly straightforward. It helps us move us toward more green policies. Each year, the Federal Government spends $14 billion for travel, most of that money going for hotels and for meeting spaces. These are taxpayer dollars that should be used to encourage the reduction of energy consumption. For instance, if one hotel initiates a linen and towel reuse program, it can conserve 200 barrels of oil, enough to run a family car 180,000 miles. 
   My amendment moves the United States towards green government by ensuring that the Federal Government considers the environmental benefits of the vendors with which they contract for meetings and conferences. This proposal expands upon a policy already used by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The EPA says this policy, they hope, ``is seen as a template that eventually may be emulated governmentwide.'' My amendment expedites implementation of this policy across the Federal Government and requires that within 180 days all Federal agencies must consider the environmentally preferable features and practices of a vendor in a manner that's substantially similar to the EPA. 
   I urge support of this amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to be not only supportive, but enthusiastic about this legislation. It does very much what we have all been talking about really actually for hours today, about the fact that it embraces our ingenuity, our innovation and our deep interest in energy efficiency and conservation and in new technologies. 
   In fact, this legislation provides for tax credit bond financing, to make sure that our cities and our States can move forward in helping our people be able to do this. There are special provisions to make sure that people can make sure their homes or residences are more energy efficient. It uses tax credits to do that. 
   And there is a provision I have worked on particularly to make sure that our largest commercial buildings can be the most energy efficient that we know they can be. We know that giving them some tax incentives to make sure that our commercial buildings are as energy efficient will help us not only today, but for 50 and 75 years in the future. 
   So I support this legislation. I am proud of it. I think we have used our public dollars in a very creative and important way.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act. 
   This bill redirects $16 billion in oil industry tax giveaways into the development of renewable energy and energy conservation--setting a new direction for U.S. energy policy and putting the Nation on a path to energy independence. 
   This new direction provides tax incentives for alternative sources of energy--renewable, American-made sources, including wind, geothermal, solar, fuel cells, and bio-diesel; 
   This new direction invests seriously in energy conservation, providing tax incentives for energy efficient vehicles, energy efficient buildings and energy efficient appliances; 
   And, this new direction empowers local and State governments, through new tax credit bonds, to invest in local initiatives that reduce energy use such as public transit, green buildings, and renewable energy production; 
   We are serious about putting America's innovation and talents to work to develop and distribute new sources of American-made energy for American businesses and American families. 
   I am particularly proud that this bill contains a 5-year extension of the energy efficient commercial building tax deduction, which I proposed in my Buildings for the 21st Century Act. 
   The building industry can play an important role in enabling America to meet its future energy needs by being models of energy efficiency. Buildings account for 39 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 71 percent of total U.S. electricity consumption. 
   We must take advantage of this moment to ensure that the next generation of buildings are constructed to the highest efficiency standards, and my proposal, contained in this legislation, which is supported by the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Green Building Council, and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, will ensure that happens. 
   I urge a yes vote because this legislation recognizes our ingenuity, innovation and technology as a Nation and moves the Nation forward towards energy efficiency, conservation, and energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, under the Democratic-controlled Congress, the country is moving in a new direction. Improvements in our health care delivery system are key parts of this new direction. 
   I applaud my colleagues for an overwhelming bipartisan victory yesterday in support of our Nation's seniors, disabled and health care providers. 
   The Medicare bill we passed yesterday will not only prevent the impending physician fee cut, but it will also strengthen Medicare and will provide more accessible access to service and will promote improved patient safety and health outcomes. 
   I'm proud to be a leader in Congress in promoting health technology. The legislation I introduced last year, which was included in the Medicare bill yesterday, promotes the use of E-prescribing by Medicare providers. Electronic prescribing will eliminate injuries, hospitalizations and mortalities that occur each year as a result of 1.5 million prescription errors annually. 
   The use of E-prescribing is smart; it is timely, and it is a major step forward in expanding the use of electronic medical records. It has the potential to improve quality, to improve health outcomes and to reduce costs in our health care system. 
   I urge the Senate to pass and accept our legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman RANGEL for his leadership and I am proud of our work to protect 25 million American taxpayers--including half a million people in Southeastern Pennsylvania--from the pain of the Alternative Minimum Tax. True to their record of increasing debt, the Republicans continue to say, ``there's no need to offset AMT relief because this tax was never intended to hit these people.'' 
   But in 2001 they knew that the Bush tax cuts would increase--by 127%--the number of AMT taxpayers this year. And they consistently used these taxpayers to mask the true cost of their failed fiscal policies. 
   We cannot ignore the consequences of these bad decisions. We are committed to reversing the Bush Administration's policy and fiscal failures. We are committed to enacting permanent--fiscally responsible--AMT relief for middle income taxpayers. And we are committed to act today to protect millions of Americans from the AMT this year without adding to the Nation's exploding debt. 
   Mr. Speaker--given the economic downturn and financial challenges facing our families and our Nation, our constituents have the right to expect fair and responsible tax policy. Today's proposal to provide tax relief to 25 million American families by closing loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest individuals is fair, it is responsible, and it deserves passage.

   Mr. Speaker, we will give grandparents and parents, children and loved ones the promise of stem cell research. President Bush's policies have let the ideology of a few dictate and degrade matters important to safeguarding the public's health. 
   That will change. No longer will the promise of stem cell research and sound and ethical medical science be stifled. 
   Instead, we will expand stem cell research. H.R. 3 will mandate and maintain the United States' stance as a world leader in medical research and scientific advancement. It will advance scientific discovery in an ethical and responsible manner. It will enhance the ability of our medical professionals to care for their patients. 
   It will use Americans' ingenuity and intelligence for the greater good. And most importantly, it will benefit millions of people who are battling disease and injury. 
   My own home State, and in particular southeastern Pennsylvania, is in the forefront of science and medicine. Our hospitals, medical schools, biotechnology and pharmaceutical institutions are home to the best and brightest scientists who are working every day to provide new medicines and diagnostics. These scientists deserve access to the tools they need to find the cures for 100 million Americans suffering from diseases like cancer and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and other debilitating diseases and disorders.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for acting so swiftly and wisely to stem the tide of foreclosures and address the sagging home values that are hurting families and communities across our Nation. 
   By addressing a whole range of issues, from the continuing foreclosure  crisis to the new and existing homes that are sitting vacant and further depressing the housing market, this package represents a significant step toward stabilizing the economy and restoring consumer confidence. 
   I am very proud of the portion of this package that came through the Committee on Ways and Means, particularly a timely, targeted, and well-designed first-time homebuyers credit; a new Federal tax deduction to help families meet rising State property taxes; and expansion of the ability of cities and States to raise capital for infrastructure improvements by partnering with the Federal Home Loan Banks. 
   In particular, I am pleased that the package includes a provision that I championed, along with my Republican colleague Jon Porter, which would enable State housing finance agencies to raise capital through tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and use these additional funds to help at-risk borrowers refinance their subprime loans, access mortgages at fair rates, and enable families to meet their financial obligations and stay in their homes. This provision will work hand in hand with the Federal Housing Agency reforms that have come out of Chairman Frank's committee and will allow States to play a role in addressing the needs of their local communities. 
   As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it, `` ..... doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers, it is in everyone's interest.'' 
   It is in everyone's interest that we overcome this crisis in the housing market, that we work to stabilize the economy, and we work to maintain and build our competitive edge in the global economy. The proposal before us is a comprehensive approach to this challenge, and I hope that it will be supported by all.

And since 1997, it has made a difference in the lives of 6 million children across this country. 
   Today, we build on the success of CHIP. It is a public-private, Federal-State partnership and secures access to coverage for 11 million children of hardworking American families. 
   At a time of rising health care costs for working families and increasing numbers of uninsured children, today we have an answer for American families. The action we take today will sustain health coverage for 6 million children currently enrolled, and will make available affordable coverage for an additional 5 million American children. 
   This is an extraordinary step forward in ensuring access to health coverage for American children. It is simply not good enough to say you support improving access to health coverage for children and then vote ``no.'' Rather, vote with children of this country and their parents.

   First, it provides for our national defense. It targets resources to the most urgent military and security concerns, including implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   Second, our budget honors our commitment to our servicemen and women. It provides funding that will enable the Veterans Administration to provide for the increasing needs of our veterans. 
   Third, our budget recognizes the priorities of hardworking Americans. It provides tax relief to middle-income families by fixing the AMT, extending lower tax rates, and continuing the earned income and child tax credits. And it expands SCHIP to provide health coverage to 7 million uninsured children in this country of middle-income families. 
   Fourth, our budget enhances our Nation's economic competitiveness and makes key investments to ensure that our future workforce has the education and skills needed to compete in the global economy. 
   Our budget is fiscally disciplined. It ends the unsustainable borrow-and-spend policies of the last 6 years, and it balances the budget in 5 years, setting us on a course to pay down our debt while meeting our Nation's obligations.

   The President's veto makes it clear that he simply does not understand the financial struggles of working families in this country who are unable to afford health care for their children. The President's veto makes it clear that health care for America's children simply is not his priority.

Our Nation's Governors, business community, health care providers, children's advocates, insurance industry, labor unions, religious leaders, parents and grandparents support this affordable commonsense plan. All but the President and his Republican allies in Congress support extending CHIP to more of America's uninsured children.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Today, Americans buy health coverage believing they are doing the right thing and expecting that they have secured access for needed health services for themselves and their family. But, unfortunately, this is simply not always true. Individuals, regardless of their age or circumstances, are denied health coverage every day due to the evidence or existence of preexisting conditions. This could be anything from asthma to heart disease, and it could affect anyone from our Nation's children to our grandparents to each of us. 
   For more than 10 years, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has provided protection for some individuals and families to ensure this information is not used to deny health coverage by either an employer or an insurer; but gaps still remain. 
   With the evolution of biomedical research, our Nation's scientists have discovered opportunities to use genetic information to prevent, diagnose, and more effectively treat some of the most devastating diseases of our lifetime. I am honored to represent some of these most brilliant researchers and scientists in Southeastern Pennsylvania. 
   In addition to the great medical potential they are exploring, genetic information also has the potential to reduce health care costs with better prevention and disease management. We must ensure that these new revelations do not come with a price: Discrimination by employers, insurers, schools, or others based on genetic information of those who are not even sick but are simply identified as being predisposed to a specific disease. If we do not reassure our fellow Americans that they are safe in taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by exploring the genetic information, then these advances in biomedical research could well be for naught. 
   For this reason, I applaud my colleague, Representative Slaughter, for introducing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and for being its champion for so many years. I am proud to support its passage today. It is important for all Americans and their access to health coverage.

Gas prices are up 17 cents in just the last 2 weeks. Since 2001 when President Bush came into office, gas prices have doubled, up to $3.13 a gallon from $1.47 in 2001. 
   At the same time, oil company profits have tripled, from $30 billion in 2001 to $123 billion in 2007. ExxonMobil alone had a profit of $40 billion, $132 for every American citizen. 
   It's time our country set a new direction for energy policy by taking advantage of America's greatest resource, our ingenuity and our innovation. This legislation embraces this goal. It accelerates the use of clean domestic renewable energy sources and alternative fuels through long-term extension of production tax credits. 
   This legislation increases research, development and deployment of clean, renewable energy-efficient technology, and this legislation promotes the use of energy-efficient products and conservation, including a provision for energy-efficient commercial buildings, which I introduced as separate legislation called the Buildings for the 21st Century Act.

The Democratic majority is delivering on our promise, and I am proud of the work that we have accomplished to expand health care to working families.

American families want and need us to maintain and expand CHIP. Their children are counting on us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. I want to thank Chairman Neal for his leadership on this issue and for his dedication to tax relief for middle-income Americans. 
   Why are we again talking about the AMT? We are here because Republicans have made it clear that they prefer political expediency over fiscal responsibility. They have decided that it is fine to pile debt onto the shoulders of future generations. They say so what if we add $50 billion next year to our national debt? So what if we add $1 trillion to our national debt over 10 years? 
   My Republican colleagues have said there is no need to pay for AMT relief because this tax was never intended to hit these people. Did they forget that in 2001 the Republican Congress knew that the first round of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy would be paid partly by pushing 24 million middle-income American taxpayers into the AMT in 2007? Did they forget that for the past 6 years their budgets anticipated tax revenues from these middle-income taxpayers to mask their failed fiscal policies of the last 6 years? 
   No, they didn't forget. They just didn't want to act responsibly. We will not act so recklessly. We will provide tax relief and we will pay for it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for proving that the Ways and Means Committee can work in a bipartisan way to extend needed relief to our nation's small businesses. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill--the first to be acted upon by the committee since I became a member--includes a provision that closely mirrors the Veterans Employment and Respect Act, which was the first legislative proposal I introduced upon being elected to Congress in 2005. 
   Section 2 of the bill before us today extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to include veterans who have developed a service-related disability and who have been discharged or released since September 11, 2001. 
   Our military service men and women deserve our utmost respect during their active service, and our support and assistance during the sometimes difficult transition back into civilian life. One key component of a successful transition is the opportunity to gain meaningful employment in the private sector. Incentives designed to encourage employers to hire some of the newest veterans--many of whom are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan--will better enable these men and women to make a smooth return to civilian life. 
   I offer my appreciation to the Chairman and Ranking Member for including this important provision and for making additional changes to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that will ensure more businesses are able to take advantage of it. This will positively impact the lives of our disabled veterans and citizens seeking gainful employment after a period of unemployment, welfare assistance, or disability.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act. By cultivating the Nation's next generation of skilled scientists and researchers who are in the early stages of their careers, the House-passed plan will better ensure that our Nation educates the best and the brightest young people to be scientists and engineers. 
   I firmly believe that leadership and innovation is absolutely necessary for the United States to maintain its competitive advantage in the increasingly global marketplace. My own home district in southeastern Pennsylvania is a leader in the field of biotechnology. I have seen the economic and social benefits of innovation and technology in science and engineering. 
   Science, research and biotechnology industries attract highly skilled workers and offer them good wages and benefits. These innovators and the businesses they are creating in my home district make us competitive in this global marketplace. Most importantly, they are developing new treatments, medicines, vaccines, that are improving the quality of life for people around the world. As the sister of a dedicated scientist and the mother of a young medical researcher, I recognize the need to support the work of highly skilled scientists whose work is on the cutting edge of research and development.  
   Madam Speaker, the ``Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act'' will help ensure that we encourage and train highly skilled scientists in Pennsylvania and across the Nation. I am proud to have supported its passage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I believe that Congress has an obligation to move our country forward with sound fiscal policy and smart, forward-thinking investments to make America stronger, safer and more secure. I want to thank Chairman Spratt and the Democratic leadership for their steadfast commitment to a spending blueprint that is fiscally sound and reflects Americans' priorities. 
   This budget reflects the priorities of Americans while balancing the budget by 2012 without adding to our national debt. It ensures tax relief for middle class American families by committing to an immediate and long-term fix to the alternative minimum tax. And it reflects our commitment to quality health care for all Americans by sustaining and strengthening health benefits for our veterans, our seniors, our children, the disabled, promoting innovation and medical research, and responsibly addressing growing costs, inefficiencies and abuses in the system. 
   This budget is a first step towards making our economy stronger, our country safer, and guiding us towards a new direction, the right direction for building success for American businesses and for American families, building this country's future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this sound and fiscally responsible budget for America.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   This package encourages the innovation and entrepreneurship needed to advance America's energy independence. It promotes economic growth, enhances the ability of American businesses to compete internationally, and provides much needed relief to American families. This proposal extends the research and development credit that encourages innovation and creates new green jobs; the higher education expense deduction that enables Americans to afford to go to college and to be able to compete in the new technology jobs. And the provisions that are included encourage renewable energy development and conservation, including a provision that I championed which incentivizes more energy efficient commercial buildings. 
   This is not the first time that we have passed these energy provisions in this House. Past efforts have been opposed by the Republicans and by the President both on substance and on how it is paid for. But this bill passed the committee with a bipartisan vote. 
   With a strong bipartisan vote today, we can send a strong message that we are ready for a new energy policy in this country and should be passed this afternoon with bipartisan effort.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, the United States is the world's leading, industrial Nation. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world, and we are a country at the cutting edge of medicine and health care, leading the world in discovery of new medicines, treatments and methods of care. 
   Yet we are a Nation that, despite spending the most per capita on health care, has some of the highest rates of infant mortality, the lowest rates of life expectancy, and the highest proportion of uninsured, when compared to other industrialized nations. We are a Nation where nearly 45 million Americans do not have health insurance. We are a Nation where over one-half of all uninsured are adults working full time, and we are a Nation where 9 million children are without health coverage. 
   Too many Americans, too many hardworking families, too many children, are without care and they are suffering the consequences. Democrats believe something must be done, and Democrats will lead our Nation in a new direction. We have solutions to drive down the cost of care. We have a plan to expand health coverage opportunities for working families, for small businesses, and for the self-employed. We understand that we must provide Americans with access to affordable health care, and we will start with America's children. 
   America's uninsured children are twice as likely to forego needed care. They are more likely to use costly emergency services for routine care, and they are more likely to miss school and to underperform, compared to their peers who have health coverage. America's uninsured children come from working families. Six million children have at least one parent who works full time. 
   America's population of uninsured children is growing. Last year, for the first time since 1998, the number of uninsured children in our country has increased. This trend is alarming, it is unacceptable, and it cannot continue. 
   That is why Democrats are committed to continuing and expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which is commonly known as SCHIP, by reauthorizing this initiative and dedicating an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years so that we can expand coverage to qualified families. This is a significant and wise investment, and it demonstrates that we as a Nation understand why health coverage matters for families, for the healthy development of children, and for the continued economic competitiveness of our Nation. 
   More than 14 years ago, the Pennsylvania State legislature enacted legislation establishing one of the Nation's first state-supported public/private children's health insurance initiatives for children of working families. I authored this proposal and I championed its enactment. This is one of my proudest accomplishments in my years of public service. I am proud of this effort not only because it led to a dramatic increase in the access to care for Pennsylvania's children, but also because it inspired Federal action. 
   Five years after Pennsylvania enacted its CHIP program, the U.S. Congress recognized that providing America's children health coverage is one of the most cost-effective worthwhile investments we can use as a Nation. So using Pennsylvania's law as a model, we enacted SCHIP. SCHIP has been an unqualified success, which is why the Democratic-led Congress wants to significantly strengthen it, and Governors like Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania want to expand it. Unfortunately, President Bush does not. 
   The President's budget did not include funding to even maintain coverage for those children already enrolled in SCHIP. It would also severely restrict those children who qualify for SCHIP. At a time when there is broad bipartisan support for moving forward and expanding our efforts to cover more children, sadly the President wants to move us backwards and cover fewer children. 
   Mr. Speaker, every child in America deserves access to health care. Our children deserve access to primary doctors who will help make sure that they enter school healthy and ready to learn, and that their hardworking parents deserve the ability to afford the insurance that provides for their care. 
   We have a plan to insure all of America's children. I look forward to working with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to enact this top priority for this Democratic Congress and for America's families.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased this evening to introduce the subject of children's health insurance and what has really been a remarkably successful Federal-State, public-private initiative that has really helped to make sure that middle class working families across this country have been able to get health insurance for 6 million of their children. So it has really been helping families all across this country be able to do what they want to do as responsible parents, and that is to be able to help pay for health insurance. Every State does it a little bit differently. That is what we are going to talk about this evening; we are going to talk about how important it has been for 10 years in this country to help children in America get the health care they need and they deserve, and it helps them get off to the right kind of start. So I want to talk more about that and I will be joined by some of my colleagues. But because one of my colleagues is going to be taking over in the chair, I am going to give him a few minutes just to talk about the subject. He is a colleague of mine from Pennsylvania. And I will say in Pennsylvania we are very, very proud of having been one of the first States well before the Federal level to start a children's health insurance program. In fact, we called it CHIP, then the SCHIP program started. In 1992 is when we started it in Pennsylvania, and I was instrumental in creating the Children's Health Insurance Program in Pennsylvania. It has been incredibly successful. 130,000 children have health insurance in Pennsylvania.     
   So a colleague of mine, who has also worked in health care for a good long time and knows about the experience of the Children's Health Insurance Program from the other part of Pennsylvania, in the western part of the State, my colleague, a freshman who's done a wonderful job already, JASON ALTMIRE, Congressman Altmire is going to say a few words, and then we'll continue for the hour.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. I thank the Congressman, and I appreciate that he has other duties to contend with, so he'll be a part of this conversation in a way. But thank you for taking the time to come to the floor and for your help on this. 
   And I think for many of us, and I know you've just come off the campaign trail this last year, and even those of us who were not campaigning every minute but certainly out and about talking to people, we do hear from everyday families about how hard it is to be able to buy health insurance for kids. 
   I mean, I remember a story, and maybe my colleagues I'm hoping will share some as well. When I was actually out and about once, and it was actually a church group. And afterwards a woman came up to me and said, you know, I haven't always shared this, but my husband, it was actually a fairly well-to-do area. But she said, my husband was laid off last year and it was a really, really tough time for us as a family. And one of the things that affected us is that we didn't have health insurance. But because of the CHIP program in Pennsylvania, SCHIP as we know it federally, she said, I was able to make sure that my kids had health insurance and they got the health care that I know that they needed and deserved and that we wanted to help make sure they got. 
   And as someone who, and Congressman Altmire referred to this, in Pennsylvania I'm known as the mother of CHIP. People do come up to me and say, well, we don't always get thanked as elected officials, but do thank me, whether it's stories where someone came up and said my granddaughter who had some health issues, daughter was working hard trying to get a degree and just didn't have health coverage. She said, my granddaughter would not have health coverage without CHIP. 
   So these are the stories we hear all the time. And I think probably my colleagues will share it. We're going to talk tonight about some of the numbers they already referred to, the 6 million children who have had access to health care, private health care in a lot of situations across the States, the money that we've been able to work with the States where they've put in their own dollars that have made a difference in helping a lot of American families who didn't think that we'd be there to help them who have been able to get health insurance for the kids. But this is a place where we are making a difference in people's lives. 
   One last story, and then I am going to turn it over to my colleagues. I was talking to a group of school counselors, and some of them, one of them said, stood up and said that she had a child come to her, a teacher came to her and said they had a child in the class who never raised his hand. He's in third grade. Never raised his hand. Never participated in discussions. And she finally broke through to found out what was going on. Turns out he had never had any dental care, and he literally was afraid to open his mouth. It hurt. He had some discomfort. He was embarrassed about the way his teeth looked. And when he got children's health insurance coverage, he got to a dentist, she said he was a different kid. And that would have been a child who would have been a dropout, would have been a troublemaker in school because he just wasn't going to be able to participate. 
   So she said, health care's important because of health care, but it's also important because of education. If kids are not well, if they don't get the preventative care they need, if they don't get the eyeglasses, if they don't get treated when they're sick, I know it makes a difference to the teachers in my school to be able to teach those kids. 
   So on every level, and again we're going to talk about big numbers here. The President wants to do $5 billion which will barely be enough to sustain this program. It sounds like big numbers to families listening, but the fact is that we need to make that commitment. And I think we, as Democrats, have said we are going to make a commitment to make sure that the Children's Health Insurance Program continues, that it continues in the dynamic way that it has working with the States. But we're going to even do more. We're going to be a little bold, even in these tough budget times, and we're going to make sure that more children who are now on waiting lists in some States are able to get the health coverage that they deserve. And this is something we can do, we should do. It's about having the political will to make it happen. We're going to protect health care for seniors; we're going to do it for kids. And that's what our discussion is about tonight. 
   And I'm going to close, and I know you mentioned this as well, the previous speaker talked about the fact that the President, and I'm a little, I have to say, this is very disturbing to many of us because our Republican colleagues helped make this program happen. It was a bipartisan effort. This wasn't something that one side or the other sort of pushed without anyone else caring about it. But the fact is that 193 House Republicans, 10 years ago, voted to make this happen. It was a bipartisan effort; 153 House Democrats. This was a joint effort. We said we wanted to make this happen. We all stand up from time to time and we are really, really proud of this. 
   So when the President last week said, you know, he just doesn't think this is important, that, in fact, we ought to be doing something else. We ought to be helping families buy private health insurance by getting them some tax deductions. They can't afford it? Well, I don't know what he means. 
   He actually went on to say that kids can get health care in this country. They can go to the emergency room. 
   That's really just stunning, given what we know about the high cost of going to emergency rooms, the fact that that is not the best place for primary care. It certainly is not the best place for children who might just need a well-child checkup. So it's absolutely going in the wrong direction on the health care. It's why we wanted to stand up tonight and talk about this. That's 
   why we will continue to until we actually get it done. And I think that the commitment that we have made is to make it happen.  
   And I'm joined tonight by two colleagues, one, Mr. Pallone from New Jersey, who has not only been a leader on upgrading the Children's Health Insurance Program, but continues to work out all the details of how to make this happen. And I'm sure he's one of the people who thought we were going to have bipartisan cooperation, and we still hope we will, but is really working on some of the details of how we can and we should do this. 
   One of the reasons we reauthorize programs is that we want to see what worked best and what didn't; we want to see what changes have to be made given our experience. He is going to talk about some of that work. 
   And my colleague from Connecticut, who as a State legislator was involved in working on the State level to make this happen and to work in a special way to make Connecticut, make it work for children in Connecticut, and feels a special connection to the Children's Health Insurance Program there. 
   So gentlemen, I would ask you to share your stories and your help on this. Maybe we'll start with Mr. Pallone, and if you would help us just sort of by giving us maybe some of the facts and figures or some of the stories that you hear from your colleagues as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to let my colleagues share their stories too so maybe we could have a little conversation about it. But I just want to say that certainly one of the points that have been criticized by the other side is that families that make as  much as $40,000 for a family of four might be eligible or are eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Now, in Pennsylvania it is a subsidy to buy private health insurance. So you either get a complete subsidy or you might just get half of it or you can buy it at cost. In fact, many parents are contributing. 
   But as you point out, for a family of four making $40,000 a year and both parents might be working, by the time they pay their mortgage and pay the baby-sitter and pay their utility costs and maybe fill up their car with gasoline and pay the loan on the car and they pay their taxes, there is not a lot of money left over to find the $12,000 that they might have to find to purchase private health insurance. So you can say, fine, go to the marketplace, but you need a little help to go to the marketplace. And that is what this is about. And it has made such an enormous difference, thinking you can put a smile on a parent's face for doing the right thing. And good for you to go back and actually say to a person we really did do something for you, and it made such a huge difference. 
   I think the other point, and this is a lead in to our colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) that the States have always done these programs in different ways. They have written these programs in ways that they think work best. 
   In 1992, 5 years before the Federal level when we were running it in Pennsylvania, we knew that a lot of these working families wanted a private health insurance card. Some States got very creative and expanded Medicaid and called it cute names, and that made it friendlier, and it is an issue just to tell people it exists. But we actually worked very hard with the private sector to get the benefits package right, to make sure that the cost was right. There were a lot of rules and regulations about it. But the fact is at the end of the day, people could walk in, families could walk into their physicians' offices with a private health insurance card, and that made them feel really proud that they were able to get some help so they could get that private health insurance. But it has made an enormous difference in Pennsylvania. And we have, as I say, about 130,000 children covered on the number of uninsured. It just goes to show it can work. When we work together, we can really make it work. 
   Mr. Murphy, if you want to add a bit about the experience in Connecticut. We have been joined by another colleague of ours, Mr. Allen from Maine, who also has a long history in being an advocate for children's health insurance and making it happen. So thank you for joining us. 
   I yield to Mr. Murphy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. If I may, I was very well aware of the fact that so many different organizations were supportive and, again, outside some of their own realm a little bit. So I asked my staff to produce a list. And I have four pages of a closely typewritten list of all the groups. It is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable and it is also the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and SEIU. But it is groups that you would think who are advocates for children: the March of Dimes and Families USA and the Children's Defense Fund. But it also is all the senior organizations: the AARP and the Center for Medicare Advocacy and the Alliance for Retired Americans. And so many of the provider groups: AMA and the Academy of Family Physicians and the Academy of Pediatricians. But also America's Health Insurance Plans and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, PhRMA, who are saying this is an important thing  to do as well, and the American Hospital Association. These are groups where you might say, well, why do they care? Now, hospitals, maybe they could get reimbursed for some of the uncompensated care that they provide, but the fact is that all these groups recognize how important it is. And we have the faith-based organizations: the National Council of the Churches of Christ and the Catholic Health Insurance Association. I mean all of them, all of them, have come together. 
   For the Record I will submit these four pages of the list of all of the different folks who have actually said this is so important. It works. It matters to people. It is helping Americans be healthier and stronger and more productive. And what more important thing can we do than that? I think that was said earlier. 
   But it is also doable. And we are taking a lot of fiscal responsibility in this new Congress among the Budget Committee. And the gentleman who is going to speak in just a minute is on the Budget Committee, and we have argued in the Budget Committee about how important it is to be smart about how we spend our money, to only spend money we can account for. So we are working very hard in this Congress to say we will not only maintain this program but we will expand it and we will find the money to do that because it is important. And when we are committed to doing something, we will find the money to do it, and that is what we are going to do in this. 
   I was going to ask my colleague, and I know you have some remarks you would like to make, but if you think about what happens if we don't continue the SCHIP program, I mean that is one of the things that people presume will, of course, continue. But, in fact, the President just said today said that he might veto a reauthorization continuation, just the maintenance of the Children's Health Insurance Program if it is not constructed the way he likes, which is really shocking that 6 million children on October 1 may be without health coverage because of his unwillingness to do this. 
   So knowing your history and your commitment to health care in general but particularly to children's health care and the good work that your State has done, if you would speak to that as well, I think it would be very helpful for Americans to understand that we are at risk here, that our children are at risk. 
   And I yield to my colleague Mr. Allen from Maine.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. And I think this is where we can get a chance to have a little bit of a conversation. There is a lot of feeling about it. I think all of us feel that we should be working as hard as we possible can to be getting this done, not be sort of saying, okay, I'm not interested, we'll do something else. 
   There are a lot of priorities here. We stand up on the floor frequently and say, okay, one of the most important things we can do is this, one of the most important things we can do is that. But the fact is if we aren't all parents, and many of us are, then we certainly have nieces or nephews we love, or neighborhood children. All of us know someone who has struggled through a moment when they couldn't provide the essentials. This is not a frill. And I think that's what you were saying, Mr. Allen, is this is not an, okay, if you can get to do it, go do it. This is something that's really essential for every child in America. And we're helping parents to be able to meet that essential requirement for their children. 
   Some of you may know, my husband is a physician. And I was joking with my staff that he cuts out articles from the New England Journal of Medicine all the time for me to read. And mostly they're not so readable for me, I have to admit, you know, they sort of need some interpretation. But just in the last week's journal there is a wonderful article talking about the imperative to continue the SCHIP program. And I'll share it with my colleagues, I'll send it around to everyone tomorrow, but really it made it very, very clear that this is something that we need to do because of the medical imperative, the health care imperative. And we know it is something that we can do.  
   So, it's something we're proud of and we should be and we want to do. 
   Mr. Pallone, you look like you're ready to jump in here.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. And just on that note, if the gentleman would yield, we do know that the number of uninsured for the first time in a long time is going up again. So we're talking about 45 million Americans. And the fact that, of those, 9 million are children who, again, through no fault of their own, don't have access to health insurance. 
   And one of the reasons is that health insurance is expensive. And even for businesses that want to provide health insurance for their employees, sometimes they're faced, particularly small businesses, with how do I actually pay that whole amount for family coverage? And they just cover the employee. And so even here, where you're talking about employers trying to do the responsible thing, but just looking at their bottom line and saying I can't do anything about this, when the parent is covered and the child is not is one situation where certainly CHIP comes in and really can be very, very helpful. 
   There has been some discussion obviously about adults. And I think this is intended for children. Some States have brought along the parents because it does help with enrollment, and we think that's true in Pennsylvania as well. But we also know that when the parents don't have health insurance, and if they can't get timely health care, then they don't have an ongoing relationship with a physician or a medical group. And the children also learn from their parents. Their parents are their models. And so if the parents are going for regular checkups and their kids are going for regular checkups and it's part of what you learn to do as a responsible person, that's a good package. It's what we want adults do be doing as well. 
   So I know that there is some discussion about that, too, whether States, now they're not allowed anymore to be able to sign up adults alone, but they're usually signed up with their children as a family coverage. And that's the way most people who buy insurance do it, too. They buy insurance for their family. That's the way it's sold mostly. So I think it's making sure that we actually allow people to sort of use the marketplace the way it really works and not punish them for that.

Again, what is interesting about the way SCHIP, the children's health insurance initiative, was set up is it said to each State, one, you don't have to do it if you don't want to, if you don't have a problem, or you don't think this is an issue. We were not even sure how it would all work out. They also said, then you can create whatever initiative works for you, what really works for you. It turns out every State has chosen to do it. 
   Actually, we already had SCHIP in Pennsylvania for 5 years when the Federal Government came in. Our governor was very nervous about taking it. He wasn't sure he wanted to do this. He was concerned it would be a new entitlement program and that he would be stuck with the bill at the end of the day. I know States had legitimate worries about that, that we actually tell them to do things and then don't give them any help in doing it. 
   But this is one case where we said, no, you have to do it. You have to structure the program. Here are some guidelines. Here is how we think you should do it. Then we are going to pay a part of it, a good part of it, but we are not paying all of it. You have to buy into it. You have to want to do it, also. You have to structure this. 
   So every State did this. We learned from each other. That also was a good thing, to look around and see what worked for other States and what didn't. When our governor was saying, should we do it? He really was very torn about it. Actually, he didn't decide to do it until September 30, and that was the deadline that year. I was very anxious. I was on the floor of the State senate many nights saying we ought to do this. I was pushing him to do that. 
   Of course, we were able then to triple the number of children who were covered because of the partnership we had with the Federal Government. That is what this is about. It really is. This is a great example of a very innovative way to create a partnership between the Federal Government and the States, between insurers in some ways and the States as well, in many cases, and between parents and families and health care providers, and say, we are all going to help make this happen.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Again, the debate here is how much can we do? What can we afford to do? What is the best way to do it? Mr. Pallone is working on all those details. I know we bug him and give our him suggestions about how to make this easier and streamline the bureaucracy and make it work for both providers and for children and for the States. So we are learning from that. I think that is pretty exciting. 
   But that is not the discussion that some are in. We were in that discussion since January, actually. This is certainly something that the President proposed. We wanted to push much further. But I just say that is unfortunate. I think that is why we are so deeply disturbed. 
   I will say that the President is consistent here. I will add just a note that when he was Governor, he was very reluctant to participate in the Children's Health Insurance Program and actually worked quite actively not to be engaged, not to have his State do it, and then tried to keep the level of the family to be as poor as possible. 
   He did not want to go to 200 percent of poverty. He wanted to keep it lower. He did not want to reach into the sort of the really working folks in Texas who were struggling. You may want to comment on that. 
   But I think for so many of my constituents, and again I think, Mr. Pallone, you pointed this out earlier, for very poor people in this country, we do have health care coverage. But for the people who are above that level, who say I don't know that there is anyone there to help me, this is actually one way to say, that is right, we are going to help you be able to get health insurance for your kids. You are working. You are trying to do the right thing, and this is the way we can help you do it.  
   So for the very people who are playing by the rules, trying to do it right, struggling to make ends meet, to be able to help them get health insurance for their kids makes such a world of difference to their peace of mind and, of course, to the actual health of their kids.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Again, our hour is concluding, but I think, in other words, we certainly are very interested, I certainly am, in making sure that the marketplace, the insurance marketplace, you are from Connecticut, so I am sure you have an interest in this, that it works; that in fact it is affordable, that we can figure out a way for businesses to work together, to be able to get a market share, to be able to maybe do some things on the individual marketplace so that in fact it can be more affordable. 
   Some of the ideas that the President has about tax deductions, not as substitutes, but for individual coverage, that's fine. We should be doing that. But not say, okay, which are going to make sure that 6 million children who have had access to health care, and another 6 million who could, who are now eligible but are not signed up, we are going to continue to deny them care, and we are going to do that by scaring you into thinking somehow we are creating some new expanded government program that is somehow just going to be evil. 
   That is sort of kind of what the President is saying, instead of saying wait a minute, this is an initiative that works. It works in every State. People are proud of it. Republicans and Democrats stand up and praise it, doctors are happy about it, hospitals are happy about it, parents are happy about it. I don't know how the kids feel when they get their immunizations, how happy they are about it. 
   But the fact is we are doing the right thing and we are meeting a priority that American families talk to us about all the time. And it is not instead of doing something else. It is really just because it is a high priority for us. It is always a question of priority, but we really I think, certainly what I want to say, we are determined to get this done, and we want to work in a bipartisan way to do it. We want to do it in a fiscally responsible way. We want to continue to build on the success of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and that is why we are going to keep talking about it until we get it done and hopefully be joined by not only our colleagues on the the other side, but the President as well.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. We have an enormous opportunity here. We want to meet that challenge and we want to do it right. So that is the challenge over the next few months. My guess is we are going to continue to talk about this for the weeks ahead, and certainly if we are lucky enough to take some vacation this summer and see those cute kids on the beach on the Jersey shore, and Connecticut has some nice beaches too, to look at them and think which ones of those, because there are, who don't have health insurance, whose parents may delay care that they should get, not get an immunization, should not get care, maybe not even treat some simple illness that ends up running through school or camp and everybody gets sick. 
   But this is about giving kids the right healthy start. It is about doing it in a cost-effective way, about being creative and innovative, and meeting that challenge that American families have every day. 
   So I thank my colleagues for joining me this evening, and I look forward to continuing to work with you. Thank you for your leadership, Mr. Pallone, as well.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today as we deliver on one of the most important campaign promises our party made to the American people, implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Today we will take steps to improve our Nation's aviation, port and transportation security. We will strengthen government intelligence and information sharing, and we will prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. And we will create a dedicated source of funding to provide first responders with communications interoperability equipment that will allow our first responders to communicate across departmental and jurisdictional lines during emergencies. 
   It was over 5 years ago when evacuation orders were not heard in the towers of the World Trade Center because police and fire fighters and other emergency personnel simply could not talk to each other. The Federal Government failed to act. And these same communication problems happened again during the failed response following Hurricane Katrina. 
   As a representative of the Philadelphia region, a major population, commerce, and transportation hub, I share the opinion that we have to do something about this. It is scandalous not to act.  
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with you as we deliver on one of the most important campaign promises our party made to the American people. 
   Today, we will implement the bipartisan 9/11 Commission's recommendations. And, today we will make our Nation safer. 
   We will: improve our Nation's aviation, port and transportation security; strengthen government intelligence and information sharing; help reduce the appeal of extremism abroad; and prevent terrorists from acquiring Weapons of Mass Destruction. 
   We will also create a dedicated source of funding to provide first responders with communications interoperability--the type of equipment that allows local, state, and regional first responders to communicate with one another during emergencies. 
   We know that the inability to communicate across department and jurisdiction lines impedes first responder's ability to address emergency situations. It was over five years ago when evacuation orders were not heard in the towers of the World Trade Center because the police, fire fighters and other emergency personnel simply could not speak to each other. 
   Despite this, the Federal Government failed to act and these very same communications problems happened again during the failed response and recovery efforts in the Gulf region following Hurricane Katrina. Prompting, in part, Thomas Kean, former chair of the 9/11 Commission, to call the Republican-led Congress' lack of progress on this issue scandalous. 
   However, local communities across the Nation have been moving forward--despite little leadership from the Federal level. In my region, the Philadelphia Police Department along with Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority are working to address the fact that  their radio systems are not compatible--making it virtually impossible for them to communicate should a coordinated response be necessary. 
   I have been working closely with city and transit officials to find interim remedies to this problem. However, it has been a difficult task, in large part, because of the lack of guidance and resources provided by the Federal Government. In fact, when they applied for a grant to help fund an interoperable communications system, the Department of Homeland Security denied their request. This denial leaves the city of Philadelphia, its transit system and the millions of daily riders, residents and workers in the region vulnerable to attack. It also leaves the city's first responders less prepared than need to be to protect the fifth largest metropolitan region in the country. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, today is a new day. It is a day when Congress acknowledges our Nation's first responders--police officers, fire fighters, medics. It is a day when we give these brave women and men the tools to properly aid their fellow Americans in need of help. 
   The aptly numbered bill--H.R. 1--will pass this body within the first 100 legislative hours of the 110th Congress, and it demonstrates that the Democratic-led Congress' top priority is protecting and ensuring the safety of the American people. 
   Thank you and I urge a ``yes'' vote on implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. I thank Congressman JOE CROWLEY from New York, who has been a leader in the New Democratic Coalition. He has really been, as a member of both the coalition and of the Ways and Means Committee, as I am, really out front and really working to make sure that we are as economically competitive as we need to be in this country. And that means all American workers being given new opportunities. And that really does involve making sure that we get these trade agreements right. 
   So I want to thank the Congressman, and thank him for asking me to join him this evening. 
   What I want to do is to add my words, some of them will be similar, I  share some of the same feelings you do, about how important it is for us as new Democrats to participate and to push to make sure that we get trade policies in this country that, in fact, are committed to advancing sustainable and responsible trade between ourselves and the rest of the world. 
   We recognize that this is a new day in the way we work. It is a global marketplace. We need to recognize that, we need to recognize these new marketplaces. 
   I, too, want to recognize our leadership on the Democratic side, Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Rangel and SANDER LEVIN, who really are absolutely committed to doing these trade agreements differently and bringing a Democratic perspective to some of the goals and ambitions that we have for our constituents and for the American people to really try and do things differently.     
   But let me also say that I understand very clearly, as I think all of us do here in Congress, that the new global economy has created real challenges for American businesses, for American workers, for American consumers and for American families, and that we need to do things differently in the 21st century. We need to recognize the competition that we are in, and we need to do a number of different things. Trade agreements are one piece of what we have to do, and do them in a way that recognizes how difficult this issue is for so many Americans. But it is not all we are going to do. 
   So we are going to talk specifically about trade this evening, but I think as you started to speak to towards the ends of our remarks, the fact is as New Democrats, and I hope for all of us in Congress, we need to work together to make sure that Americans are well prepared for the jobs of the 21st century, and that means investing in education, demanding more from our educational systems, demanding access to higher education and job training. It means making sure that people displaced by globalization, by the changing marketplace, have access to continuing education and job training, and that they are trained for jobs that are family-sustaining, that help them be able to do all they want to do for their families, and that we help American businesses be as innovative and as technologically advanced as they possibly can. 
   Our support as New Democrats for research and development, for ways and means, for tax credits that help advance the use of technology in our businesses and to make sure that we are competitive are all things that we need to do, in addition to making sure that our trade policies are really going to work for American businesses and American workers. 
   You went into some detail, and I think that was important, but let me certainly say that what we have done and what has been put forward by Chairman Rangel and by Congressman SANDY LEVIN really is an enormous change over the agreements that we have seen in the last 6 years in particular. I want to say I am very proud of the fact that they held really firmly on putting forward, making sure that we and other nations really meet international labor standards. They were missing in our trade agreements. 
   If we are going to bring up the standards of workers in other countries, if we are going to be able to compete with workers and businesses in other countries, we need to have them make a commitment to those ILO standards, to the international labor standards. 
   We also stood firmly on making sure we were going to demand that other nations work on environmental protections. That means when we are dealing with Peru, we are talking about logging and making sure that they meet commitments. 
   Of course, we will need to make sure on an ongoing basis that language that is written in these trade agreements is enforced. It does not help us to write good language, although that is the first step; we must make sure there is an enforcement. I think many Democrats, and I hope that it is true for all of us, are concerned about the lack of enforcement that has gone on in the last 6 years. I myself have raised some of those questions in the Ways and Means Committee hearings. 
   So we are not finished by any means, even by speaking tonight. This is a broad template. We are referring to it as a new trade policy for America. But we feel very strongly, I certainly do, that we have made an enormous step forward here in making sure of the trade agreements, and we expect the template to be first used in our pending agreements with Panama and Peru. 
   There are obstacles and other issues that have to be dealt with in our trade agreements. This is just part of the special ones that often have to be dealt with. They certainly will be with Colombia, with North Korea, that are not spoken to in this template that will be very specific. 
   But the fact that this framework requires and demands that we will see higher labor standards in other countries, that we will see higher environmental standards, that we will see a commitment to really meeting these international standards, is a commitment that I think we have made to American workers. As I say, it is a piece of helping to make sure that American businesses and American workers can meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
   We will continue to, I certainly will, make sure that we do everything we can to make sure our workers are well-trained and prepared for the jobs of the next century, that those jobs are here in America, that we can complete in an international global marketplace. 
   This is really our responsibility in Congress is to be able to say what we expect of these trade agreements, to put language in those trade agreements. But the fact that we can work with this administration; you know, it has been hard to work with this administration on a lot of issues. The fact is this has been a breakthrough on trade. 
   The administration wants to see these trade agreements, but we weren't willing to relent without these high standards on labor and on the environment, and, again, I am going to add on enforcement. 
   I will say also that we fully expect that the work that we are going to do on education and on research and development and on innovation really is going to, I hope, put ourselves forward in making sure that we are going to be as competitive; that we add the work we are going to do on energy, bringing down the cost of energy; that we can add what we hope to do on health care and bringing down the cost of health care for our businesses and creating more access to health care. 
   We are really looking long term, because this is long term, in making sure that America continues to be the leading industrialized Nation in the world, that our people live at the highest standards, and that they can compete in a global marketplace in a way that we have always been proud of American products, and we will always be, and that we will, in fact, be able to make sure that our workers have the access to jobs, and that around the world we see all of the economies grow and expand and create new markets for us as well. 
   So I yield back. I will be happy to go into, as I know Mr. Crowley will be, into some of the specifics about some of these standards. But, really, I think what we want to do tonight is say as Democrats, we believe in the American worker. We believe in American business. We know we can compete. We need fair trade agreements that are enforced by this administration, and I know we will stay right on it to make sure that happens.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. If the gentleman will yield, I think the way you put it, I wanted to just echo that. What trade agreements really are are setting the rules. I think you are right. There has been, I hear it, I think we all hear it. We go in our districts and people say trade is ruining us. Yet many of those same people work in companies that sell products overseas and are proud of the work that they do. They realize how specialized, how important the work is that we do, and how we often are still setting the standards in the world marketplace. 
   But the reason to set these rules and to set the rules as strongly as we can, and we are setting them now, it doesn't mean they won't be changed at some point. They may need some tweaking, which is why you renegotiate these agreements. They don't go on forever. It is a dynamic marketplace we are in. 
   But it also means we can then go enforce those rules. And when we see lack of enforcement, I understand that frustration. I have businesses come to me, and I have tried to advocate on their behalf to say, wait a minute, it is in the rules, and we are unfairly disadvantaged. Is there something we can do? Sometimes there is. 
   We have seen dumping of steel. We are concerned about currency manipulation in China. These are complicated issues. In some ways, I am learning some of them myself. 
   But the fact is there are such different systems in these different countries, and we need to recognize that. But there are so many nations now that want to have a capitalist system and be able to have private investment and to be able to compete with us. At the same time there are very different rules in some of these countries, so we have to have a mechanism for interpreting what is fair and what is not.     
   That is part of the reason we do these trade agreements. So if there is unfair manipulation, if there is dumping and State support for a company that makes it very difficult for us to compete, we have the rights within these agreements to bring forward those complaints and to have a fair hearing.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. We spoke before about all of the other things that we need to do to ensure that our businesses and workers are fairly able to compete and excel. 
   One of the other things that I was going to say is that when we look at these new environmental standards, it also creates opportunities for American businesses. We have been speaking in a different context about the way we are going to create more energy-efficient businesses and products. And I am sure you have been visited, as I have been visited, by entrepreneurs across this country who have great ideas and are trying to move to market with solar and wind and biofuels and are ready to go. 
   When you think about these other countries that are trying to move very quickly to gear up and create new businesses, they are going to be looking for that technology and they are going to be looking for the scientists and the engineers. Hopefully, we will do a little patent protection and intellectual property protection, but this is where America has been so great, have that innovation and be on the cutting edge to do the very next thing that will then be bought by not only other American companies, but by other nations' companies as well. I think there is a hunger across this globe for that kind of interaction and cooperation. Market working, that is really what this is about, and trade capacity. 
   So what this does, and it is not the end-all and be-all. I think that is something we want the American people to understand. These are trade agreements, some of the rules and trying to make sure that it is fair for American businesses and American workers, and then are enforced. But we have a lot of other work to do on education and health care and research and development and some of our tax laws to, in fact, make sure that we can compete and it is fair. 
   But I think we, as new Democrats, in particular, are very excited about this challenge. It is scary. We hear from families who are committed to making some of those other changes, particularly in trade assistance adjustment. I think we will. So we recognize how difficult this is. There have been certainly some serious bumps, and those are very, very hard for families. 
   But we also have seen businesses grow and thrive and we have seen individual workers go on to do remarkable work as well. That is what we are trying to do with not just the trade agreements, but with all of the work that we are trying to do in here in the Congress.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. I just want to make a point here that when you talk about lifting up, I want to make sure that people understand what trade agreements really are about. This is not the foreign aid bill, and we will discuss it in another moment, and I think there's important work that we do through some of that. 
   This is also saying to the countries, if you're going to be our trading partner, you have to allow certain labor standards. Some of them are really very well known. We'll not allow child labor or slave labor. But we're also saying that your workers have a right to organize, have a right to bargain, and to be able to have workers in some countries that have not had this opportunity to be able to band together. 
   We know how important it is, as part of our own history continues to be in speaking up on behalf of workers and making sure they're paid fairly and treated fairly, that our rules are fair.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Exactly. We know there's a huge struggle. 
   So part of what we're saying is if you're going to be our trading partner, then there's certain expectations about the way you treat people, and that is true in the workplace. And once we're partners, there are also broader issues, of course, about human rights and about rule of law, and, you know, we have some deep concerns about this as well. And this becomes sometimes complicated, but having that trade agreement often allows the beginning debate and engages us to be able to make, in some ways, some of these other expectations for themselves and for us as well to be part of the world community, to be part of the world economy. 
   And part of it is we don't want our own people to be disadvantaged, but because we understand they have a right to organize, they have a right to speak up, and if we have some kind of engagement with them, then their standard of living will improve and, of course, hopefully their human rights.

   It is important for us to move forward on these trade agreements. I think all of us would say this is a major breakthrough for the Democrats to see this kind of labor and environmental standards and kind of enforcement and commitment to do that. 
   But the real question is, this is just a piece of the puzzle. This is only one part of it, and we're committed to a much broader agenda of making sure our young people are prepared for the future, that some of our slightly older people also have the enormous opportunities for new directions for them as well, and that our businesses can be competitive. 
   So we've a lot of work to do to making sure that our tax policy and our trade policy and our education and health care policies and energy policies all contribute to making sure that America has that economic capacity and opportunity for all of our people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, today we will again attempt an override of the President's veto of the CHIP reauthorization bill. 
   Over the last 6 months, while President Bush and his Republican allies on the other side of the aisle have doggedly refused to take action to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, a public-private venture that helps middle and low-income families be able to buy private health insurance, to an additional eligible 4 million children in this country, during that time the demand by America's working families for accessible health coverage has only increased. 
   Amid this economic downturn, with skyrocketing energy costs, a record number of mortgage foreclosures, fewer new jobs, the rate of unemployment has jumped dramatically in the last year, adding an additional 900,000 Americans who are jobless. Two-thirds of unemployed individuals lose their health care coverage for their families when they lose their jobs. So it is times like these when CHIP is needed most for their children. According to the Joint Economic Committee, as many as 1 million additional children will likely become eligible for subsidized health coverage like CHIP as a direct result of this economic downturn and increased unemployment. 
   Now is not the time to turn our back on America's children. It is time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in supporting America's working families when times get tough, like they are now. So they should join us, and I hope they do, because together we could and should override this misguided veto by the President, and help America's working families and their children weather this economic downturn and get health care to the children of America. 
   Health care should not be optional. It should be something we are sure that every American child has access to. Now is the moment when Republicans on the other side of the aisle can stand up for working families, for children in this country, and make sure that 10 million, an additional 4 million children, get health care coverage under CHIP.

I am proud of our work here in Congress to make affordable health coverage available to an additional 5 million American children, while also protecting the health needs of our sense. 
   The Democratic Congress understands the health care challenges facing our Nation's working families. We heard their need and we responded. We passed a plan to expand access to quality, affordable health care for our Nation's children, while ensuring that our seniors receive the care that they have been promised. 
   It is unacceptable that 47 million Americans, including 9 million children, do not have access to affordable health coverage. It is unacceptable that American seniors are facing limits in access to doctors they trust and treatments they need, and it is unacceptable that President Bush and his allies in Congress are comfortable with that status quo. 
   It is time to act, and Congress has. We call on the President to stop working against us as we move to ensure health care for America's children.

   Our action today will protect 23 million Americans from unexpectedly having to pay the AMT for the first time this year. 
   We in the Democratic majority are committed to enacting fiscally responsible tax relief, but the President and the obstructionist Republicans have made it clear that to them adding to the national debt matters not at all. 
   Under their watch, the national debt has nearly doubled. Rather than making tough decisions, they have opted time and again to push the cost of government on to future generations. 
   Congressional Republicans repeatedly and stubbornly resisted our efforts to ensure that we protect 23 million Americans from the AMT and do so without adding to the national debt. 
   The Democratic Congress is committed to our pledge of fiscal responsibility. We will work to ensure the tax relief we pass today will not add to the national debt. 
   I vote for this AMT tax relief to give 60,000 hardworking American families in my district the tax relief they deserve, and I pledge to work to make sure we don't pass on the cost to future generations.

We increased fuel efficiency standards and set a new path for energy independence that will create new jobs and enhance our economic competitiveness. We enacted the largest college financial aid expansion since 1944, bringing the American Dream within the reach of millions of children in our country. And we are about to pass the largest increase in veterans health care in American history in honor of the service and commitment of all of our veterans. 
   We accomplished all of this in spite of the stubborn resistance of Republican obstructionists who have tried to undermine our efforts at every opportunity. We did this despite the President's refusal to compromise. 
   This year is coming to a close, but our commitment to change will continue. Hard-working American families can be assured that when we return in January, the Democratic majority will continue to fight for their and our priorities. 
   Best wishes for a happy, healthy, secure and hopeful new year to all Americans. God bless our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The resolution before us supports the goals and ideals of National Save for Retirement Week, which this year falls between October 19 and October 25, 2008. I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Johnson of Texas, for working with me to bring attention to the importance of retirement planning for American families. 
   We are living in a time when workers are being asked to shoulder an increasing share of the cost of saving for retirement. Even with an employee-sponsored retirement plan and the promise of Social Security benefits, Americans need to put additional money aside to ensure a financially secure retirement. 
   For many Americans, saving is becoming an increasingly difficult task as they struggle to meet their everyday obligations. Even in solidly middle-income families, financial resources are stretched thin as parents work to meet other pressing needs, whether it's purchasing health care coverage, paying for college, buying a tank of gas, or simply paying monthly bills on time. 
   Over the past several years, we have seen a dramatic shift in our retirement system. Most workers are no longer eligible for traditional pensions, which provide a predictable monthly benefit throughout retirement. Instead, workers are bearing more of the costs and investment risks of saving adequately for their retirement through workplace defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s or through IRAs. 
   As a result, the value of most Americans' retirement benefits, and the security of their retirement, is now directly linked to their own decisions and the amount of dollars that they save over the years and the balance held in their accounts when they retire. 
   The dramatic shift towards individual defined contribution plans is clear. According to Employee Benefits Research Institute, only 10 percent of workers are currently covered by defined benefit plans, compared to 63 percent of workers who are currently covered by 401(k) plans. This stands in stark contrast to the reality of 30 years ago when it was just the opposite, when coverage rates were 62 percent for defined benefits plans and 16 percent for 401(k)s. 
   While this shift is empowering American workers to make more of their own financial decisions, many families are finding it difficult to save significantly to meet their retirement needs. It is particularly difficult during a time of economic uncertainty, as we are experiencing today. 
   It may be difficult but continues to be vitally important for Americans to prepare for retirement, to think about savings, especially given that half of all workers have less than 25 percent in total savings, whether for retirement or to help them in periods of financial difficulty.  
   As our country shifts towards an increasing reliance on individual savings and as families are tempted to dip into their retirement accounts to meet current everyday expenses during this time of high gas and food prices, it is more important than ever that we educate Americans about the pressing need to save even small amounts every year that they possibly can. 
   In my district, I have partnered with banks and credit unions and other financial institutions to host seminars to help provide information on how to make educated, financially responsible decisions about personal and family budgets and to help establish a habit of saving for the future. 
   I have even visited with schools in my district to help reach out to young people in order to emphasize the importance of saving for the future. It is never too early to learn that every little bit we save now will help in the long run. 
   So whether you're a 16-year-old receiving your first paycheck, or a 25-year-old getting your first real raise, or a 45-year-old with a mortgage and two kids, the habit of putting a little bit away every month in regular savings can, with the help of compound interest, add up to a more secure retirement.     
   The resolution before us supports and encourages educational opportunities on a national scale and creates a collaborative effort to emphasize the importance of making savings for retirement a priority for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution so that we can help Americans create a financial security for themselves in their retirement years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. I just want to close by thanking my colleague Mr. Johnson for working with me on this legislation this year, and for encouraging even in these difficult economic times that all Americans think about saving even a little bit of I week. With compound interest, it does add up, particularly if you start young to do that. But any time is good. And certainly as we recognize that there is increasing reliance on our own individual ability to save and to think about the future, this is an important resolution that can help Americans have greater financial security in their retirement. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Every day, hardworking moms and dads without health coverage worry about their children getting the care they need. 
   Under this President's watch, the number of uninsured children in this country has grown for the first time in years, and what has the President done? Nothing. That's right, nothing. This President has done nothing. Will Republican Members of Congress stand with the President and also do nothing, or will they stand with America's children? Ten million children and their families are waiting to find out.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (2008 BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. As a Member of the Budget Committee, I am proud of the 2008 budget that we sent to conference committee this week. Our budget is a responsible one, and it is attentive to America's priorities. 
   First, our budget honors our commitment to our service men and women. It provides funding that will enable our veterans' health system to meet increasing needs. 
   Second, our budget recognizes the priorities of hard-working Americans. It provides tax relief to middle-income families by fixing the AMT, extending lower tax rates, and continuing the earned income and child tax credits. And it expands SCHIP to provide health coverage to 7 million children of middle-income families who are currently uninsured. 
   Third, our budget enhances our Nation's economic competitiveness. It makes key investments to ensure our future workforce has the education and skills needed to compete in the global economy. Our budget is fiscally disciplined. It ends the unsustainable ``borrow-and-spend'' policies of the last 6 years. And it balances the budget in 5 years, setting us on a course to pay down our debt while meeting our obligations. 
   We should all be proud of this budget. It is a new direction; it is the right direction for America.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel for his leadership on this bill, and I rise today in support of tax relief for hard-working American families. 
   This Congress is committed to moving our country in a new direction. We recognize that families across this country are struggling with everyday living expenses, and with this bill we are going to help millions of Americans get tax relief. 
   Our work will protect 23 million Americans--including over 60,000 of my constituents--from the unexpected and difficult cost of the Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   The Alternative Minimum Tax, the AMT, was originally intended to ensure that the very wealthiest taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes. But the AMT is increasingly being paid by middle-income families, and in fact, next year tens of millions of these hard-working taxpayers will be engulfed by the AMT if this Congress does not act. 
   This bill provides tens of millions of middle-income homeowners with immediate property tax relief. 
   It expands the child tax deduction, helping millions of families. 
   And it ensures that parents, who often work tirelessly to send their children to college, will get tax deductions for college tuition. 
   This middle-class tax relief is based on the principle of tax fairness. And it is paid for. Unlike tax efforts under the Republican Congress, our bill will not add to the national debt. It will not leave debt to be paid for by our children and grandchildren. It will not add to the debt that weakens the dollar and undermines our economy. 
   The Democratic majority is unambiguous. We are committed to fiscal responsibility, to paying as we go, to making the tough decisions required to refocus national priorities, and to giving middle-income families the break they deserve. 
   A vote for this bill is a vote for tax relief and tax fairness. It is a vote for economic growth. And it is a vote for honest budgeting. 
   Mr. Speaker--our constituents didn't send us here to make easy decisions--they sent us here to make responsible ones. 
   And today, the Democratic majority will make the responsible decision of providing tax relief to millions of working families.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise as a member of the Budget Committee. I am now in my second term. There is a great contrast between what went on in the last 2 years when I was in the Budget Committee and this budget that is being presented. 
   I want to compliment, first of all, on behalf of the people in my district, the 13th Congressional District in Pennsylvania, and as a proud American, to be able to do the right things fiscally, to be responsible, to compliment and congratulate Mr. Spratt for putting forward a budget that is fiscally disciplined and fiscally responsible. And it is very different than the budgets we saw presented by the President or that I have seen passed in my last 2 years in Congress. 
   This budget is fiscally responsible, and it is a budget that is committed to new priorities for Americans, priorities that recognize the needs of the American families. This budget ends the Republicans unsustainable borrow-and-spend policies. 
   One of the most irresponsible things we could do we have watched them do for the last 6 years, and that is, spend money we simply do not do not have, with no real expectation about how we are going to repay the debt that we have incurred. In the last 6 years, we have reached a point where we have, because of their borrow-and-spend priorities, an almost $9 trillion national debt. 
   This budget will put our Nation on sounder financial footing. It won't correct everything because the fact is that you can't deal with an $8 trillion debt in 1 year, and we won't. But this budget does put us on sound fiscal footing, and that is something we should all be proud of and we should all support, both sides of the aisle, because what this budget does is it says that we are going to finally take responsibility to pay for what we spend and we are going to reach a balanced budget in 5 years. 
   We are going to have some surplus at the end of that 5 years. We are going to be able to start paying down our debt that we would otherwise be leaving to our children and our grandchildren. And at the same time, we are going to do everything we possibly can to make sure that we spend a few extra dollars, take money other places, pay as you go, as we have talked about, to actually be able to put some more spending into education and health care and veterans' health. 
   You have heard about some of that already this evening, Mr. Chairman, but we want to be absolutely clear that this budget requires any new Federal spending, including what we do this year, to be fully paid for, rather than left to future generations. It balances the Federal Government's checkbook within 5 years without raising taxes. It sets us on a course to pay down that debt and to pay for Social Security. It  is committed to tax relief for hardworking Americans, particularly the middle class, and we are committed to do so in a way that is fiscally responsible by saying we will do it and we will pay for it. 
   And we have asked our committees to take that seriously. I am on the Ways and Means Committee. We fully expect to deal with what would be an enormous tax increase on middle-class Americans, the alternative minimum tax, by not just patching it for 1 year, as the Republicans suggest and have been doing for 6 years, but by, in fact, fixing it permanently. 
   This budget also, Mr. Chairman, and I want to emphasize this, recognizes the priorities of American families as they seek to meet their obligations, just as we should as the Federal Government. 
   Fifteen years ago, a long time ago now, in 1992, I worked successfully as a Pennsylvania State Senator to start one of the Nation's first children's health insurance programs. We call it CHIP; the Federal Government calls it SCHIP. But as a result after 1992 to now, we have 150,000 children in Pennsylvania who have health insurance they wouldn't have had otherwise, private health insurance, and 4 percent of Pennsylvania children still don't have coverage. And nationwide, there are 7 million children across America who are uninsured. This is unacceptable. 
   So let me just say, Mr. Chairman, this budget responds by dedicating resources to insure those children. So let me just say this budget is a win for America's children, and it is a win for America's family. It is a budget that values our Nation's future economic outlook. It balances the budget. It lays the future groundwork for prosperity for the future of this country. It gets us to a point where we can pay down our debt. This budget is a proposal that presents a new direction for America. We should all be for it. It is fiscally sound and makes that investment. 
   I am proud to support this budget. We all should be.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Madam Speaker, the American people are clear, they want this Congress and the President to ensure that America's children have access to health coverage. American parents on behalf of the children who get health care coverage under the CHIP program are clear: CHIP is working. Health care under CHIP is affordable and is accessible. 
   We have compromised, but we are determined. We are determined to continue and to extend CHIP for America's children, 10 million American children of working families. This bill before us is reasonable, it is smart, and it is responsible. A majority of Congress agrees; yet the President and some in Congress are still unsure. 
   The choice is clear: Vote for health care for America's children or stand in the way. The American people are watching, they are waiting, and maybe, most importantly, they are hoping we will do the right thing and 10 million American children will have access to health coverage. 
   Let's make it happen. It's time to make this vote work. Today is the day for a majority of Republicans to join us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. The President has rejected legislation to strengthen and expand CHIP for 10 million children of hardworking American families. The President's veto makes it clear that he has chosen to ignore the financial struggles of working families in this country who are unable to afford health care for their children. His veto makes clear that health care for America's children simply is not a priority for him; and the Republicans in this Chamber who support his veto today illustrate that they, like the President, does not understand or have chosen to ignore how well CHIP has worked and how positively it has impacted the lives of millions of American families. 
   The Nation's Governors, health care providers, children's advocates, insurance executives, labor unions, religious leaders, parents and grandparents all support CHIP's affordable coverage for millions of American children. They know the President's veto is shortsighted, it is callous, and it is wrong. 
   Today is the day of decision to stand with the President or to stand with America's children. Ten million American children and their families are waiting.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, in 1992, I was proud to spearhead one of the first State initiatives to enable working families to purchase private health insurance for their children; 5 years later Congress passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, enabling every State to implement its own plan. 
   Today 6 million American children have health coverage thanks to SCHIP. We in Congress are building upon the extraordinary success of SCHIP to extend it to almost 9 million American children who are now uninsured. The goal of insuring all American children is within our reach. 
   Yet, instead of working with Congress to reach this goal, the President this week made it clear that health insurance for children is not important to him. 
   Does the President really believe that America's children do not deserve quality ongoing health care? Does the President really believe that emergency rooms are the best place for primary care for children? 
   It is clear to just about every American that health insurance is expensive, and for too many American families, it is simply too expensive. 
   Congress recognizes the urgency of the situation, and we move ahead, unlike the President, to take this opportunity to cover every American child.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, today President Bush, as required by Congress, has reported on progress made by the Iraqi Government on political and military benchmarks. He reported that the Iraqis have not accomplished any of these goals. 
   It is time, in fact past time, for the Iraqis to take control of their own future. It is time for the Iraqis to move forward, resolve their internal conflicts and begin the process of national reconciliation. 
   More than 3,600 Americans have paid the ultimate sacrifice to bring freedom  and democracy to Iraq. Our military has performed exceptionally; for that and for their sacrifices, our Nation will be internally grateful. 
   But without progress by the Iraqis themselves, there is little more that our military can do. And despite the stubbornness of our President to stay the course, it is time for us to bring our troops home. 
   I am proud to be with the majority in Congress and across America in supporting this responsible plan to redeploy our troops, set a new course in Iraq, and lead our Nation towards greater security here at home and across the world.  
   I rise in support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act and I stand in support of a change in strategy for U.S. involvement in Iraq: one that sets a timetable for prompt and safe withdrawal of our armed forces. 
   For many of us on the House Floor today this is not the first time we have voted for such a change, or demanded a new plan from the President. 
   In March, we voted to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq, improve troop readiness, and demand accountability from the administration. The President vetoed our plan. 
   In May, Congress enacted specific political and military benchmarks for the Iraqi government. By tying the goals to funds for military action in Iraq, we made it clear that progress is a prerequisite for continued assistance by the United States. 
   Today, President Bush, as required by Congress, reported on progress made by the Iraqi government towards those benchmarks. He reported that the Iraqis have not accomplished any of these goals. 
   More than 3,600 Americans have paid the ultimate sacrifice to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq. Our military has performed exceptionally. They removed a government hostile to the United States and took responsibility for providing enough stability to enable the Iraqi people to establish their own free and independent government. For that and for their sacrifices, our Nation will be eternally grateful. 
   Yet, as the war enters its fifth year, sectarian violence and failure of political progress has put our troops in a more and more threatening and dangerous situation. This volatility and the President's surge strategy have increased U.S. and Iraqi casualties and injuries. 
   It is time --well past time--for the Iraqis to take control of their own future. It is time for the Iraqis to move forward to establish an effective system of government, to resolve their internal conflicts, and to begin the process of national reconciliation. Without these actions by the Iraqis themselves, there is little more our military can do. It is time--well past time--for us to bring them home. 
   On behalf of the American people, we are seeking to do just that. Today we will vote once again to end our military involvement on the frontlines in Iraq and bring our troops home despite the stubbornness of our President to stay the course. 
   It is my hope that that Republicans will join us in supporting this responsible plan to redeploy our troops and to press the President for a new course in Iraq. As Democrats, we will lead this country towards a more responsible--more strategic path--to end our military involvement in Iraq. In so doing, we remain committed to protect our nation, our people and our strategic interests at home and around the world.

   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, early this morning the Children's Health Insurance and Medicare Protection Act, which extends access to quality care for both our Nation's children and our Nation's seniors, was passed out of committee. 
   With this important legislation, we are wisely investing in the Children's Health Insurance Program to protect and extend access to health coverage for millions of America's uninsured children. 
   In its 10-year history, CHIP has had strong bipartisan support not only because of what it accomplishes but how it meets its goal, with a flexible, cost-effective market approach to access to health insurance. Yet it has become the object of scorn by this President and with Republican leaders in Congress forcefully opposing this successful public-private partnership which enables literally millions of hardworking American families to buy private health insurance for their children. 
   And this legislation strengthens and sustains Medicare for American seniors by securing payments for physicians and quality, innovative health care options for seniors. 
   Protecting Medicare and extending CHIP is the best opportunity this Congress has to address the need for affordable quality health insurance for Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHWARTZ. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Speaker, on Monday morning of this week I had the opportunity to recognize and honor 53 elderly widows of veterans of World War II and the Korean War. 
   The sacrifices of that Great Generation are legendary, and they are a reminder of the sacrifice of the current generation of our military men and women who have heeded the call to service in defense of our Nation. Their patriotism, their willingness to put themselves in harm's way, possibly to pay the ultimate price for our Nation, should give us all pause. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I stand here with deep gratitude and respect for the sacrifices of all of our troops, but especially for the 3,124 Americans killed in Iraq and those tens of thousands injured. 
   I stand here with great sympathy for the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, whose loss is irreplaceable. I stand here tonight firmly and strongly in support of this resolution, in support of the troops, and in opposition to the President's escalation of our military involvement in the war in Iraq.     
   Let there be no misunderstanding. The men and women serving our Nation in our Armed Forces will continue to receive the support they require during their training, while they are in theater and when they return home. 
   It is in honor of their service and the sacrifices of their family, and the love of our country that we share that I stand to make it clear that the President's plan for Iraq to escalate the number of troops and to continue his failed conduct of this war is wrong. 
   Escalation of this war will not make our Nation safer. Escalation of this war will not stabilize Iraq. Escalation of this war will not move us closer to bringing our troops home, and escalation of this war will not better protect Americans from those terrorists who would stop at nothing to bring grave danger to our Nation and our allies. It is for these reasons that the President's escalation of the war in Iraq is wrong. 
   At a time when so many current and former military leaders, as well as the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, recognize the need for political, rather than military solutions to the ever increasing violence, that the President is so gravely misguided in sending more of our men and women into combat in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is the answer to a simple question: Do you believe that an escalation of this war will bring our troops home sooner, and will it help the Iraqis achieve the national reconciliation needed to bring a lasting peace to their nation? I and the majority of Americans do not think so. 
   We believe the facts are clear. Escalation of this war fails to address the administration's strategic and diplomatic failures. It does not move us closer to success. 
   What we now need to succeed in Iraq is an overwhelming political and diplomatic force, not more American combat troops. Instead, the President should be working to end U.S. combat involvement in Iraq. To do so, he must demand that the Iraqis take charge of their internal security, should demand that the Iraqi President take the lead in national reconciliation, he should engage all the regional parties to prevent this war from escalating regionally and to explore every diplomatic and political solution to end this war. 
   Finally, the President must be accountable for his actions to this Congress and to the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the first 6 weeks of the Democratic control of Congress, we have begun to move our Nation in a new direction, to restore credibility and ethics in this Chamber and to put the interests of everyday Americans in the forefront. There is so much more to do, here at home, and in our relations internationally, to better ensure the security and opportunity for all Americans. 
   The war in Iraq overshadows all that we do. The war has already cost this Nation so much, young lives lost, greater uncertainty and instability in the Middle East, greater hostility towards our own Nation and financial costs that will take years to repay. So it is timely and right that we take action now to change direction and strategy in Iraq. 
   I stand with the majority of Congress in support of this resolution, in support of our troops, and in opposition to the escalation of U.S. combat troops in  Iraq. This resolution sends the President a very strong message. It is our hope and the hope of the American people that he heeds it.
