<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, the Consumers Union dubbed 2007 the Year of the Recall. This year, product recalls are happening at an even swifter rate. After dangerous toys led to injuries and deaths, the Democratic Congress worked hard to protect our children and families. 
   This week, will be bringing a final bill to the floor that will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ensure that families are protected from dangerous toys. The legislation bans lead beyond small amounts in products intended for children under the age of 12 and prohibits the use of dangerous materials in children's toys. 
   The bill bans industry-sponsored travel by the Consumer Safety Commissioners and staff in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest. It also provides a significant budget increase for the CPSC so that it has the resources to test more toys. No longer will there only be one tester per toy. 
   Madam Speaker, let's protect our children today by once again passing legislation with strong bipartisan support.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (WELCOMING THE REVEREND RICHARD ESTRADA -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and good morning to all. 
   It's a privilege and honor today to welcome a dear friend of mine, Father Richard Estrada, who traveled from Los Angeles to be here to provide the House with its opening prayer. I am delighted to present Father Estrada to my colleagues, and I want to thank him for taking the time to be here. 
   As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, it is fitting to have Father Estrada serve as guest chaplain. Father Estrada has dedicated his entire life to serving those less fortunate than us, particularly the homeless and at-risk youth. 
   He is the founder and executive director of Jovenes, Inc., a nonprofit organization which serves the homeless and at-risk immigrant youth and other disadvantaged individuals from the East Los Angeles area. He is the associate pastor at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church, La Placita, the oldest church probably in the country. 
   Father Estrada received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of San Francisco and studied theology and pastoral counseling at the Graduate School of Theology in Berkeley, California, the Mexican American Cultural Center in San Antonio, Texas, and the Fred C. Neiles School in Whittier, California. 
   In addition to his advocacy on behalf of the homeless and young people, Father Estrada is a champion for the humane treatment of all immigrants and their families. In fact, I recall him asking me to go with him across the border to place bottles of water for those immigrants that were dying in the fields and in the desert. 
   I ask my colleagues to welcome Father Richard to the House today. We have before us a great man of honor and compassion.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this legislation, the bill, H.R. 6, and also on the rule. 
   H.R. 6, as you know, will lower energy costs, strengthen our national security, and reduce global warming emissions, and create what I say are ``green collar'' jobs. Major investments in renewable energy could create over 3 million jobs in 10 years. It would also eliminate the outsourcing of good-paying jobs. 
   Here I am in a classroom in East Los Angeles. If we have the political will to do this now, why can't we put our money where our mouth is and help the American public better understand that this new technology, the greening of our country, should be made available to everyone? Leave no one left behind, whether in the Bronx, whether in East Los Angeles, across this country. There is a whole new wave of emphasis and trust and hope that we here in the Congress are going to do the right thing. 
   I don't have any earmarks. I know my staff has worked very diligently with our committee and as a member of Energy and Commerce to see that we do the right thing. We spent laborious hours working on this legislation. 
   I ask for Members to support the bill and the rule.

   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support as a family member from a strong union background. My father was a shop steward for the Teamsters and my mother was a proud worker for the United Rubber Workers, who worked tireless for 20 and 25 years. Without the health protection we received and the retirement benefits, I know myself and my seven siblings wouldn't be where we are today. 
   It is important for people to have the ability, especially in this day than a time, when new women, new immigrants, are coming about, and want to be part of the American fabric. One of the ways they can do that is by joining the union, being part of that, to have those protections in place. 
   When union people get paid good wages, that money stays in the community, it helps to provide a vibrant economy, it helps to also even send their children, like me, who is a child of immigrants and of a union household, to be able to come to college and to eventually even run for office. Wow. Outstanding. 
   The unions always get a bad name by certain people in this area, but I will tell you one thing: I am very proud to stand with many of our union members to see how they have revitalized many of our communities, especially in Los Angeles. 
   I ask for you to support H.R. 800.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Good morning, Mr. Speaker, and buenos dias. 
   You know, folks, this is the people's House, but for much of the last 6 years, House Republican leaders chose to run it with an iron hand--one where only the voices of the special interests were heard in this House. Opposing voices were always ignored. 
   House Democrats vowed to restore democracy in this House and today we live up to that promise by committing to a fair and democratic process and the end of the 2-day workweek. Our proposal specifically prohibits holding votes open for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome. We all remember the Medicare prescription drug vote. I  do. I remember staying here in the wee morning hours, 3 hours, when that vote was held open in 2003 so Republican leaders could twist enough arms to win their vote. That is not how democracy is supposed to work, and our rules change would prevent that from ever happening. 
   We are also going to give Members more time to read bills so that they actually know what they are reading. It should be par for the course to get a bill of a thousand pages and then begin to vote on it. We need to have more time to review that. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, democracy returns to the House.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for allowing me to speak this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise with a very heavy heart today in support of this so-called Children's Health Insurance Program because I can't afford not to have our children covered. That is what SCHIP has been about for the last 10 years. We need to continue that service to those kids who are covered. It hopefully will not be dropped off, and we can continue to expand the program. 
   I will tell you that I do have differences with our party, and especially the Republican Senate Members that refused to allow for coverage of legal permanent resident children and pregnant women. 
   We passed a good bill, the CHAMP Act. We worked very hard, and I thank our leaders of our committee and our Members for allowing us the opportunity to provide interpretive services for hard-to-reach populations, to go out and do the right thing and to get more children enrolled.     
   This is not the expansion that many of us envisioned that are sitting here tonight, but it is the best we can do. I can tell you, we had a meeting earlier with Speaker Pelosi. She has made a commitment to continue the discussion with us, and we will make that a priority for the people that we represent here in America. 
   If we can send troops, send our soldiers to defend our country and yet not cover their families and their children, then we have moral corruption going on in this Congress. I support this bill. Again, I say I have a heavy heart.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (COUNTRIES HIT BY HURRICANES FELIX, DEAN, AND HENRIETTE -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 642, a resolution I authored to express our sympathy and support for those affected by the recent hurricanes in Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. As the only Member of Congress of Central American descent, I am very concerned about the impact of the hurricanes on this impoverished region of the world. 
   For the first time, two Category 5 storms, Hurricanes Dean and Felix, made landfall during the same year, both striking Central and Latin America. Earlier this month, Hurricane Felix, a Category 5 storm, made landfall along the remote border of Nicaragua and Honduras. The storm killed over 130 people and damaged or destroyed over 19,000 homes, mostly in Nicaragua. The aftermath has been devastating for thousands of families. 
   Hurricane Dean, another Category 5 storm, hit Mexico and the Caribbean coast and killed 27 people and damaged or destroyed over 50,000 homes. Nicaragua, in Central America, is one of the poorest countries in the area and was the hardest hit by Hurricane Felix. 
   The complete economic and human toll of the hurricanes is still unknown, but we must act quickly to ensure that humanitarian aid continues to flow to the communities impacted. Supplies, including food, clean water and rebuilding materials, are essential. Economic aid for the agriculture economies that those countries rely on is also badly needed. 
   House Resolution 642 recognizes the U.S. Government's initial humanitarian efforts and urges increased and continued assistance as the effects of the hurricanes unfold. The resolution also recognizes the efforts of humanitarian relief groups, including the International Red Cross. 
   Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well the damage and destruction that can result from hurricanes and other natural disasters. The area I represent in Los Angeles is prone to wildfires and earthquakes, and we are still working to support those affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   Just as Hurricane Katrina showed us how disruptive and damaging natural disasters can be, they are all the worse for less developed countries. We all remember the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 11,000 people and caused catastrophic mudslides in the same region nearly 10 years ago. We can and must help our neighbors in Latin America to recover from these hurricanes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 642.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
   Today I rise in strong support of the rule and of the domestic priorities the House will consider today as a part of H.R. 2642 
   I strongly support provisions to expand and improve the GI benefits for veterans education. Our veterans who have served our country in combat and who are looking to begin to complete their college education deserve GI benefits. 
   I also strongly support provisions which provide vital support for workers by extending unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks. In the district that I represent in California, east Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, unemployment rates are above 8 percent. 
   This legislation will help to keep food on the table for our families and our workers affected by the declining economy. This legislation also appropriately includes a moratorium on seven misguided Medicaid regulations. More than 170,000 people in my district alone in California rely on Medi-Cal for their health care. And although Healthy Families serves more than 19,000 children in my district, another 18,000 children remain uninsured. 
   If the regulations go into effect in Los Angeles County, we will also devastate our Los Angeles Unified School District and our public hospitals who serve many working class people. 
   I am pleased that today we are prioritizing education for our veterans, the health of low-income Medicaid  beneficiaries, and of course our families and working families. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and provisions which address pressing domestic needs. 
   I strongly disagree that small business owners and wealthy millionaires are going to be heavily impacted by this resolution. That is the Republican playbook, trying to tell you that somehow we are going to harm those people that are requiring and calling out for our assistance. This bill addresses their issues.

   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise as a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific Islander American Caucus to pay tribute to the millions of Americans of Asian and Pacific heritage for their valuable contributions to our great country. 
   The district I represent has benefited from the economic and social contributions from the Asian and Pacific Islander Americans. That includes the Cities of Monterey Park, known as Little Taipei, Rosemead and West Covina, as well as other neighboring communities in San Gabriel Valley. In my district, there are approximately 120,000 API descendants. 
   For example, according to the Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Americans own at least two-thirds of Monterey Park's more than 5,000 businesses. 
   Many of the constituents I represent came to America in the hopes of providing for their loved ones and plan to reunite with their families. 
   This month comes at a tough time, especially for many of those of Asian descent, particularly those that were affected by the recent earthquake in China. My sympathies go to their families. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the API community and others to bridge the gap to provide better services to all our residents and grow our economy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to express my strong concern about the fiscal crisis that we are facing here in our country. 
   The subprime mortgage crisis has directly impacted millions of American homeowners, particularly in my own district in the San Gabriel Valley. As the chart shows, nearly 650 families in my district somewhere lost their homes to foreclosure. In Los Angeles alone, a family loses their home every hour. 
   Nationally, unemployment rates have risen above 5 percent. Half of my district has a rate above 5 percent. In East Los Angeles, it is upwards of 7.2 percent. Other economic indicators are showing signs of an economic slowdown, including a sharp decline in consumer spending and the largest annual increase in wholesale prices in 26 years. 
   While I am proud that this House has passed billions to provide relief for middle-income Americans and small businesses and increased the minimum wage, we still have to do more. I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to bring economic security back to the working families, not only in my district, but across this country.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, good evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago I had the privilege to visit our service men and women serving in Iraq, and I saw for myself what is really happening on the ground. 
   I met with several service men and women from cities that I represent, the city of Azusa, East Los Angeles and West Covina in California. I spoke with troop commanders, Iraqi women representing NGOs, and two parliamentarian women. 
   My trip to Iraq confirmed my belief that we must supply better support for our troops, including redeployment out of Iraq. But supporting our troops means securing our troops and making sure we minimize the risks they really face. Our troops, as you know, are overextended. The length of time they are spending in Iraq is not only demanding, but exhausting. For many of them, it is not their first tour either, this is their second, third and maybe even fourth. 
   While our troops remain committed to their work, they are concerned about the impact their duty is having on them and their families. The time they spend with their families is shorter with each tour of duty. 
   Our troops are concerned about the lack of adequate equipment. Some troops lack the basic equipment needed to do their job, like body armor. In fact, one soldier told me they don't have light bulbs. I said light bulbs for what? They said well, Congresswoman, for our vehicles. When we are asked to go into the communities, if we don't have light bulbs on our vehicles we can't see. Another one mentioned they didn't have scissors, and I said, Why do you need scissors? And he said because if one of my men gets hit, I need to have scissors to be able to bandage and provide whatever help that person needs. 
   In some cases they told me that the equipment they use is unreliable due to overexcessive use. And I was appalled to learn that some service members are forced to share their equipment with recent arrivals. The new members of the service that we are sending in in this surge or escalation are actually taking equipment away from those who are being currently deployed there. Without the proper equipment, our troops face significant and unnecessary risk to their lives. 
   Supporting our troops also means redeployment and an Iraqi nation that will govern itself and its people. Unfortunately, the best plan President Bush offers is another blank check request for his already failed policies. 
   In California, the 32nd Congressional District that I represent, as you can see, 13 of our sons have already given their lives, the ultimate sacrifice. U.S. casualties, as you know, are close to 3,200, and more than 24,000 service men and women have been injured or permanently disabled, and more than half of those will not be able to lead normal lives. 
   This blank check that President Bush provides must end. By deploying additional service men and women into combat, the President shows just how out of touch he is with the real needs of our troops and the reality of the situation. The increase of troops will do nothing to improve the long-term security situation. 
   The President's escalation plan ignores the very needs of these veterans. The crisis, as you know, at Walter Reed highlights the fact that this administration has not prioritized the health care needs of our returning veterans. And as Members of Congress, it is our responsibility to protect our troops and veterans when our Commander in Chief will not. We need a plan that will ensure that there will not be permanent bases in Iraq. And we need to ensure that all troops are provided with adequate equipment and training needed to do their job safely. 
   Our plan must require the Iraqis to take control of Iraq and bring other Arab states together to help solve this problem. Our plan must refocus also on Afghanistan. And our plan must ensure that our service men and women and veterans receive the best care available when they return home.     
   This includes traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, culturally competent health care, housing, and education. 
   The troops and their families have kept their promise to us. We must now keep our promise to them, and I am proud that we have made such a plan available. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health & Iraq Accountability Act, in my opinion, is key to this success. It supports our troops. It holds the administration accountable. It establishes a plan for redeployment, and provides for our veterans. 
   My trip to Iraq strengthened my belief that the right course of action is to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. Our men and women in uniform are doing their job, and we in Congress must do ours so that our troops will come home and receive the care that they deserve. We must not continue to turn our backs on those who proudly have served our Nation, and I will continue to fight and support our troops. 
   I look forward to their redeployment and their safe return to their families, to their friends, and to their loved ones, and I look forward to a resolution, and an Iraq governed by Iraqis, and a world safer and more secure for all of us. And I know our leadership will help to take us there.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my strong disapproval of the Supreme Court's decision last week that effectively endorsed pay discrimination against women. 
   Pay equity is a problem for women around the country, but especially for women of color, women who look like me. On average, African American women earn only 64 cents for every dollar and Latinas earn only 52 cents on the dollar compared to their white male counterparts. 
   We need to protect the rights of workers, to remedy wage discrimination, and do more to close the pay gap between men and women. That is why I cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would give teeth to the Equal Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act would entitle the plaintiffs to backpay, compensatory, and punitive damages for ``intentional'' wage discrimination. 
   Without serious penalties for wage discrimination, violations will continue and working men and women and their families will suffer. 
   We can and must fix the Equal Pay Act so workers all around can be fairly compensated for wage discrimination, and we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the wage gap.

In the case of Latin American immigrants coming to this country, many fled because of poverty and injustices, sometimes civil wars. 
   In the case of our brothers and sisters from Africa, many were brought here as slaves and were indentured and never were paid for the hard work that they provided. In fact, a large number, hundreds of thousands, reside in the Caribbean and in Latin America. We are also descendants of those individuals, and we should proudly proclaim that we not forget that part of our history and that it go down and be noted and that we do everything in our power to help educate future generations about the injustices that exist, existed, and continue to exist in this country now. Whether it be forced slave labor in our sweatshops or whether it be the maquiladoras in Mexico or Central America, there are many people who are still suffering from enslavement.

I would like to thank the gentleman and also take this time to acknowledge the support of Chairman Lantos, Subcommittee Chairman Engel, Subcommittee Ranking Member Burton, who is here, and Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who are the original cosponsors of House Resolution 100, for their tireless work on this issue. I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I know that we have heard much this afternoon about this predicament that exists in Guatemala. It has been going on for many, many years. This resolution that I introduced earlier this year would acknowledge the murders of 2,500 or more young women and girls that have been mutilated, attacked, assaulted and killed in Guatemala. 
   The murder rate for women and young women continues to rise there. It's as though there's a blind eye on the part of the government in Guatemala, as well as ours. That is why I brought this measure to the floor here. I think it is important that when a crime against a woman is done in any part the world, it's a crime against all of us and humanity. 
   Therefore, I want to acknowledge the support of our colleagues, and especially for the hard work of the advocates, the groups that actually help to bring this issue before the Congress. They could have, at any time in the past 10 years, come and spoken to any Member of Congress about the issue. But the time wasn't right. Perhaps the politics, the environment, just wasn't fit for that. But now that we have seen resolutions come out of this House, where we worked on a bipartisan basis to deal with the issues of the women of Ciudad Juarez, and now we bring forward this issue. 
   Now we have more support on both sides of the aisle to say that the violence has to stop. There must not be impunity. Everyone should be held accountable. There needs to be transparency in government on the part of the Guatemalan Government, and on the part of our government as well, provide technical support, and also help to seek some resolution to the violence against these women that continues to go on. 
   I want to thank those groups that especially have worked hard with us to combat this particular crime. I would like to mention their names, Amnesty International, the Washington Office on Latin America, the Guatemala Human Rights Commission, Human Rights First, and, also, a group from my home area, CARECEN, the Central American Resource Center advocacy group based in Los Angeles. 
   They are strong supporters of House Resolution 100. Did you know, in fact, in the City of Los Angeles, this has one of the highest concentrations of Guatemalans. So many of them know distinctly how important this resolution is. They thank the Congress for bringing up this measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record letters from CARECEN and 20 other advocacy groups that are also in support of this resolution.

   Just a month ago, I had an opportunity, with four other Members of Congress, to visit Iraq, to visit our soldiers. I met with many, many platoons and individuals representing my State of California. We are there working hard. We need to support those troops. 
   Indeed, many of them said that they have been on their second and third tours. They were exhausted. They wanted to come home and see their families. One young man told me he hadn't even seen his child, who had been born 18 months already. Several of them told me that they did not have adequate equipment. And I said please explain that. ``Well, ma'am, we don't have light bulbs.'' ``What do you need light bulbs for?'' ``We need light bulbs for our vehicles. When we go into town and we are checking for explosive devices, we have vehicles that are not adequately equipped.'' 
   In addition, with the escalation going on right now, they are having to share their equipment with the troops that are coming in. That is shameful. That is what this administration has done to our troops.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday House Democrats introduced legislation that will provide additional low-income children with health insurance coverage they need and deserve. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection, or CHAMP, Act would reauthorize an extremely effective State Children's Health Insurance Program, known to many as the SCHIP program, which will expire September 30 if Congress does not act. 
   If SCHIP is allowed to expire, millions of our American children could lose their health insurance. In a letter issued last weekend, bipartisan Governors at the National Governors Association meeting called for urgent action to reauthorize SCHIP. They know, as do Democrats in Congress, that this program is vital for ensuring children in low-income families to have better access to health care. That is why passing the CHAMP Act is so important. 
   Mr. Speaker, SCHIP was created almost 10 years ago by this Congress with bipartisan support and now enjoys the support of many Governors across the other aisle. I hope Republicans in this body will listen to their gubernatorial colleagues and join us in passing the new CHAMP Act.

   The legislation includes provisions to focus our efforts on global climate change by establishing a commission of the government's top scientific experts tasked with identifying key areas of scientific research and empowering them with the resources to finance their work. It also provides for funding, over the President's request, for clean water funds, reducing diesel emissions, clean air grants, and ensuring that environmental laws and justice and regulations are followed.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, Americans have felt left behind by this administration and a Republican Congress that did not prioritize issues important to many Americans. With the November elections, we had hoped that President Bush would get the message that Americans wanted change. Unfortunately, the President's budget, in my opinion, is no different than many of the budgets of his last 6 years; it leaves too many people behind. 
   Six years ago, the President vowed to leave no child left behind, but his budget underfunds our schools by $15 billion. How can the President hold schools accountable when he refuses to give them the funding necessary to make those improvements? 
   The President's budget will also force States to eliminate health care coverage for children because he refuses to provide enough money to the SCHIP program to cover more than 9 million kids now enrolled in the program. At a time when 1 million more Americans are joining the ranks of the uninsured every year, do we really want to take health care coverage away from the most vulnerable populations, the children and low-income parents? 
   Mr. Speaker, the President's priorities are different than ours, and our budget will look significantly different.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 63. 
   I am a strong supporter of our service men and women and strongly committed to finding a reasonable and responsible resolution which includes a redeployment of our troops. However, a responsible resolution does not include the deployment of more of our brave service men and women to Iraq. Sixty-six percent of Americans oppose the President's escalation plan to send additional troops to Iraq. They believe, as I do, without a new policy to secure the peace and stabilize Iraq, further escalation will do nothing but unnecessarily risk the lives of more U.S. service men and women. 
   There are currently 135,000 U.S. troops courageously serving in Iraq. At the direction of our government, they left their fathers, mothers, brothers, children, and wives. This war is having, as you know, a significant impact on their families and our communities. 
   In the district that I represent, the 32nd Congressional District of California, we have lost 13 sons to combat. Note the photograph that I have here on display. This includes Lance Corporal Francisco Martinez from the city of Duarte in the San Gabriel Valley, who bravely served our country despite not even being a U.S. citizen. I was able to meet his parents. They were very humble individuals who spoke only Spanish and proudly stated that their son served their country with honor. It breaks my heart to think that this was only one servicemember, only one of the more than 3,000 families that have been through this since the war started almost 4 years ago. 
   The past 3 months, as you know, have been the deadliest months in the war in over 2 years. While Latinos make up 12 percent of the U.S. population, they make up 17 percent of the service men and women in combat in Iraq, and 11 percent of those have already been killed. U.S. casualties are now more than 3,100 and more than 23,400 service men and women have been wounded in action, and nearly half of those wounded will not be able to lead a normal life because of severe injuries, permanent disabilities, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Yet many of these service men and women will return to Iraq for a second, third, and maybe even a fourth tour. 
   The President's proposal to escalate ignores the real needs of our troops and the grave reality of this situation. Three times in the past 2 years the number of U.S. troop levels have increased in Iraq. Three times this approach has failed. And during Operation Together Forward, additional troops were sent into Baghdad because of an increase in sectarian violence. U.S. military spokesman General William Caldwell stated that the increase was a failure and had ``not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in the levels of violence.'' Even the commander of the U.S. Central Command in Iraq has testified that top military commanders in Iraq do not believe that increasing the number of troops is the right approach. He stated, ``I do not believe that more American troops right now is the solution to this problem. I believe that the troop levels need to stay where they are.'' 
   Increasing the number of U.S. troops is not a solution. The increase does nothing to improve long-term security and end sectarian violence. Our country needs a policy to secure and stabilize Iraq and one that constructively engages in diplomacy and partners with our neighboring countries and the region to create a stable and peaceful nation, not a blank check to send more men and women into harm's way. We need a policy and a plan to put the welfare of our service men and women first so they can come home, rejoin their families, and receive the care they deserve. They should include adequate services for returning service men and women, including culturally competent care, mental health care for veterans, housing and education. 
   We need a plan to ensure that U.S. tax dollars are not going to war profiteering and fraud, such as the $1.4 billion that has been somehow charged by Halliburton. I strongly believe that this is possible, but it will require courage, cooperation, and leadership on the part of all my colleagues. Let me say to my colleagues that I support our troops and the war on terror. Unfortunately, the war in Iraq is not the war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to support and protect our sons and daughters who are serving, as these young people have served us so well. I will do so by voting for this resolution and by supporting their redeployment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of our troops, and I want to underscore that. But I also want to make clear that I am opposed to the war in Iraq. Our service men and women are proudly serving our country. More than 3,063 of our sons and daughters, including 13 from the 32nd Congressional District that I represent, have given their lives. 
   This war, as you know, has cost taxpayers $387 billion so far, and an additional $100 billion to $130 billion is going to be requested by this President. There is no plan to secure the peace. There is no accountability for companies like Halliburton that have been found to make more than $1.4 billion in unreasonable and unsupported billing charges, and our veterans lack the support needed and deserved. 
   We need a plan that ensures that there are no permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq, and not a plan to increase the buildup. We need a plan which investigates and punishes companies engaged in war profiteering and fraud and a plan to redeploy our servicemen and women. We need to find a political solution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today we will consider the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. 
   Two Federal commissions, one in 1947 and the other in 2004, recommended to the Congress that the people of Guam have not been made whole despite efforts to rehabilitate their lives and livelihoods that were destroyed during Guam's occupation by Japanese Imperial Forces during World War II. 
   Two Federal commissions have spoken about the atrocities of war they lived through: beheadings by public executions, rapes and torture. Two Federal commissions have underscored that the patriotism of the people of Guam during their occupation was unquestionable. Two Federal commissions recommended we make additional reparations to give them justice and parity. 
   It is past time that Congress heeds the recommendations of both Federal commissions to recognize their loyalty and patriotism. I urge my colleagues today to vote in favor of H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Today, I rise in strong support of the rule and H.R. 6. H.R. 6 will lower energy costs, strengthen our national security, reduce global warming emissions and create green collar jobs. The bill recognizes that energy policy is not only about improving the infrastructure, but also about creating economic opportunities for all. 
   Major investment in renewable energy could create 3 million green jobs over the course of 10 years. These jobs can lead to self-sufficiency, prosperity, higher wages and access to benefits and better career choices. These jobs will stay in the U.S. and will not be outsourced. 
   I am proud that the bill authorizes $125 million for workforce training and green collar jobs which includes Pathways Out of Poverty grants, so that as Silicon Valley advances, so will people in East Los Angeles, the Bronx and the Midwest. 
   The bill says to American workers, particularly urban and rural workers, there is a place for you in the green economy. I urge passage of the rule and passage of H.R. 6.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize all our service men and women, especially those celebrating the holiday season away from their families and friends. This past Saturday, I had the honor of welcoming home 200 soldiers who served in the 115th U.S. Army Unit located and based out of South El Monte. These are two young gentlemen that I happened to meet earlier this year in Iraq on a recent visit. I was delighted to see that they were home. Many had already spent two or three tours there. In fact, I would like to have the House recognize that there are over 600,000 immigrants currently serving in our Nation's Armed Forces; 35,000 of those have pledged their service and loyalty to our country in spite of not being citizens. 
   I am particularly proud of this young gentleman, Jose Diaz, a resident in the 32nd Congressional District, who came, communicated in my office and said, Congresswoman, I want to become a citizen. We helped to expedite his paperwork while he was serving abroad. I was also happy to see him this Saturday at a homecoming for his family. 
   I say this today to you, Members, because in the holiday season, we need to remember all of our brave soldiers, men and women who are currently serving us across the country, and I would ask all of you to please remember them in your prayers.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (DTV TRANSITION ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I would like to thank the gentleman from Indiana for recognizing me, and I also want to declare my strong support for S. 2607, the DTV Transition Assistance Act, which will help improve our country's transition to digital television, or DTV, as it is known. 
   This bill ensures that the funds already set aside for the DTV transition are being used more effectively. With leftover funds from a low-power TV grant program, this bill enables the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to allocate an additional $5 to $7 million this year for consumer education in underserved communities, such as seniors, minorities, and in rural areas. 
   All of the underserved populations, especially Spanish-speaking households, are at the greatest risk of being left out of the DTV transition. According to recent testimony from the NTIA, 40 percent of the calls coming into the converter box coupon call center are from Spanish speakers. There is a demonstrated need for additional education in Spanish-speaking households about DTV, and this additional funding will also help smooth the DTV transition for all Americans. 
   I also want to urge my colleagues to address the DTV transition issues along the U.S.-Mexican border. While the funding for the bill will help, we need a targeted outreach effort along the border because of access to both analog and digital TV signals from Mexico and the U.S. after the U.S. DTV transition. 
   I have personally introduced H.R. 5435, the DTV Border Fix Act, and urge my colleagues to please consider cosponsoring this piece of legislation. It will help facilitate those emergency responses so that people on both sides of the border can hear what's happening, but particularly on our side of the border. 
   I urge the Members today and colleagues to support this bill before us but also to think more importantly about what the next steps are and how to help those underserved communities who don't speak English.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart but in support of the rule. Our economy is not stable. Working families are suffering. Unemployment is over 10 percent in my own district. We have over 2,300 people who have lost their homes to foreclosure. Retirement and pension funds are losing value. Local government can't make decisions. Half of small business owners rely on mortgages for lines of credit and many small minority and women-owned businesses are suffering right now. 
   We have to have regulatory reform and oversight. We have to address this foreclosure crisis, and I believe that our leadership will do everything they can in their power to make sure that we make these Americans whole. We have to restore trust in our banking institutions and we have to cap CEO payouts. That's why I am now looking at supporting the rule and supporting the bill. I know it's hard for my constituents, but I think we have to do the right thing. This is what we were brought here in Congress to do today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Earlier this week, the world came together at the United Nations to discuss the need to take action against climate change. The United Nations Secretary General stated, ``I am convinced that climate change and what we do about it will define us, our era, and ultimately the global legacy we leave for our future generations.'' Missing from the discussion, however, was none other than the United States. 
   Rather than engage, the Bush administration continues to bury its head in the sand, organizing summits to discuss aspirational goals and ignoring real science.  
   The science is certain. Human activity impacts human security, and without a mandatory agreement, the costs of climate change will continue to be socialized. Business as usual cannot go on. We must commit to mandatory reductions in order to protect health, environment, and security around the world. 
   Our cities, States, and Democrats in Congress are leading by example. I hope the administration will join us and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Vulnerable communities in the United States and around the world deserve nothing less.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, Republicans say they favor an all-of-the-above solution to our Nation's energy crisis. Yet their record from the past 8 years tells us something different. 
   Republicans have consistently voted against critical solutions that should be a part of a comprehensive energy package. For instance, they voted against important tax provisions needed for renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. They voted against responsible drilling. They voted against efforts to protect consumers from speculators who manipulate our markets. They voted against measures to bring down oil prices. And lastly, they voted against American workers by not supporting green collar jobs. 
   These votes and others show the true Grand Oil Party whose primary goal is to protect the record profits of big oil companies. If my colleagues are really serious about supporting an all-of-the-above energy proposal, then they should join Democrats and support a sensible and comprehensive energy package.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the gentlewoman from California and my colleagues of the Progressive Caucus. 
   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this budget resolution. And as you know, Members, this budget marks a new direction for our country. It reflects the values of millions of hardworking people across the country. And I am proud that this budget rejects the President's cuts to core public health and environmental programs. These core programs include Superfund programs, land and water conservation funds, drinking water State revolving funds, State and tribal assistance grants, Leaking Underground Storage Tank programs, environmental justice programs, and brownfield programs. 
   Under the misguided priorities of the Bush administration, funding for these programs at the EPA, if you didn't know this, have been dramatically cut back by 22 percent, and our communities continue to suffer. Under the President's fiscal year 2008 budget, States will have lost over $1 billion in Federal funds since 2004 and may be forced to lay off numerous staff, leave vacancies unfilled, shut down existing air monitors, or otherwise curtail monitoring programs. Regional or contract personnel are making judgments about water safety systems despite not even being qualified. And environmental justice, those programs are on the chopping block right now. Two-thirds of already overburdened cities that are working to create economic opportunities by revitalizing formerly blighted communities in our country known as the brownfields programs have not received sufficient funding. 
   Our budget, this budget, rejects these cuts by appropriating $31.4 billion for these programs, $2.6 billion over the President's budget. This is a down payment so that we can begin to reinvest in our neighborhoods and communities, and we are doing it without raising taxes for the middle class. I am proud that this budget will help improve health care for all our families, secure education, address global warming issues, and keep our promise to our Nation's veterans. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the health, well-being, and economic security of all working families in our country, and I support this budget.

   More than 800,000 children in my home State of California depend on the Healthy Families Program. More than half of those children happen to be Hispanic. The health of millions of children will be endangered and millions more will continue to suffer if we do not reauthorize this program. 
   We in Congress have an incredible opportunity to do what is right for our children, especially those children who are disadvantaged and come from low-income families. All children, regardless of race, income or geography deserve a healthy start in life. 
   It is time to end this false allegation that undocumented immigrants are receiving this coverage. Ten million children are counting on us to do the right thing. We have a moral obligation to protect the health and well-being of all of our children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the Speaker and I am very privileged this morning to pay special tribute and honor to the legacy of Cesar Estrada Chavez. Chavez dedicated his life to championing the rights of farm laborers and all working people and he did it through nonviolence. Recently I returned from a trip with the Speaker to India where I visited a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi and I recall that moment thinking about the nonviolence that was also expressed by Cesar Chavez in his movement to fight for dignity and respect for poor people, for people that were being oppressed. 
   Like Gandhi, Chavez believed that nonviolence is one of the most powerful tools to achieve change, including social and economic justice. Chavez was a follower also of Martin Luther King, Jr. believing in the power of prayer and spirituality. I have been inspired by the works of Cesar Chavez and also by the cofounder of the United Farm Workers, Dolores Huerta, and with that had introduced a resolution in this House to pay tribute to Dolores Huerta, one of the highest ranking members of the UFW. Yet until this day, we have not been able to bring that resolution up and I wonder why. And I ask the question--why can't this House also pay tribute to a strong leader, a female, who represents the workers? Also with that in mind, I introduced legislation, the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act, H.R. 359, that did pass out of this House, that would for the first time authorize the Department of Interior to study public lands important to the life and history of Cesar Chavez through the National Park Service. Right now that bill has made its way out of the House and is over at the Senate. I would ask that the Senate Members there take action on the bill as soon as possible. 
   We should be grateful and never forget the accomplishments and achievements of Cesar Chavez to improve civil rights for every single American and those individuals who work and toil in the fields. Let us not forget the fruits and vegetables that we receive on our table come from those very farm workers here who may not even today have the same protections that Cesar Chavez worked so hard for.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Not since 1944, with the GI Bill, has Congress taken such a proactive step in ensuring that millions of Americans can attend higher education institutes. 
   It is time to start providing our students with the aid needed to keep America competitive by strengthening the middle class and increasing diversity on our campuses. H.R. 2669 will allow middle class and minority families to have access to quality education by increasing grant aid and lessening the burden of loans. Along with H.R. 5, this legislation ensures that our students will finally have the funding for higher education that has long been denied them. 
   This bill will increase the Pell Grant by $500, benefiting 646,000 students in my home state of California. In addition, 6.8 million students nationwide who take out need-based federal student loans would see the interest rates cut in half, providing California alone with over $1.4 billion more in loan and Pell aid. H.R. 2669 not only puts and keeps students in college--it strengthens our communities by providing financial assistance to people entering public service careers, like nurses, police, firefighters, first responders, and teachers. 
   For students in Los Angeles, this is real dollars in the pockets of those who need it most. Since 1980 the Latino population in the United States has doubled, but Latinos attending college has only increased 5 percent during this same period. Latinos continue to face numerous obstacles on the road to college. Low family incomes, low financial aid awards and a reluctance to assume debt has hindered Latinos for too long in achieving their higher education goals. The College Cost Reduction Act helps support those institutions helping Latino students by guaranteeing $500 million over 5 years for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges. 
   Financial assistance was critical to my ability to obtain a higher education and I am proud that H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, will help Latinos and other low income students get the financial security to pursue their dreams. I strongly support this legislation that invests in our students, our communities and our Nation.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, H.R. 2. As you know, women and minorities make up a disproportionate number of those earning minimum wage. In fact, they haven't seen a wage increase in 10 years. Too many single head-of-household women struggle to make ends meet, some working two and three jobs every single day to make sure that their children are cared for and the rent is paid for; 61 percent of those are sole bread earners. One-third of those, as you know, are women raising their children. Most don't even have an opportunity to have health care coverage. African American women and Latinas only make up 23 percent of the workforce, but they represent 33 percent of the women only receiving minimum wage. 
   This fair minimum wage package will allow for 1.4 million working moms to get an increase in pay. Let us not forget those women who are working in the garment industry in the Northern Mariana Islands who only earn $3.05. These women also work up to 20 hours a day in squalor with no health care and no reform in labor. 
   I stand up for those working women and men, and urge the support of H.R. 2.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (THE WAR IN IRAQ, LATINOS AND TROOP ESCALATION PLAN -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, good evening to you and to those families that are listening to us tonight. 
   I believe our Nation needs a policy to secure and stabilize Iraq, one that constructively engages in diplomacy and partners with neighboring countries and the region to create a stable and peaceful Nation in Iraq. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush missed the opportunity to set the United States on a new course in Iraq. Without a plan to secure the peace and stabilize Iraq, President Bush's plan will do nothing but unnecessarily risk the lives of more U.S. servicemen. 
   I have here displayed 13 of those service members who represent my district, most of whom, if you can look through each, are under the age of 30 and who left families, parents and children. They went to serve our country with honor, no doubt, but many of them enlisted in the Reserve and the Guard hoping that they would come back to get a college education, to have a better life, to be able to get housing and to get health care for their families. Unfortunately, that dream is not true for many of them. 
   There are approximately, at this time, 132,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq. This war, as you know, is having a significant impact on our families and our communities. Last December was the deadliest month of the war in over 2 years. U.S. casualties have exceeded well over 3,000 lives, and more than 22,700 servicemen and women have been permanently injured or disabled. Nearly half of those will not be able to lead a normal life. 
   While Latinos make up just about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they make up 17 percent of the service men and women in combat in Iraq, and about 11 percent of those have already been killed. 
   In the District that I represent in California, we have lost these young men. Sadly, Latinos, both citizens and noncitizens, and I mean those that carry green cards, are proudly there to serve our country, but we need to do more for them. 
   In 2001 to 2005 alone, the number of Latinos in the Army who enlisted rose by 26 percent. There are currently 35,136 green card soldiers proudly serving our country today. An additional 28,000 have become U.S. citizens since 9/11, and 73 have been granted citizenship after death. 
   This includes one of my very own, who was a fallen soldier early in the war, a young man, Lance Corporal Francisco Martinez, in the Marines, representing the City of Duarte in the San Gabriel Valley. His service to this Nation is countless. He was not even a U.S. citizen. He gave his life and was granted posthumous citizenship. But we need to do more for our soldiers than that. 
   The plan the President is going to speak to us of tonight ignores the real needs of our troops and the reality of the situation. Three times in the past 2 years President Bush has increased the number of troops in Iraq. Three times the approach has failed. From November 2004 to March 2005, the level of U.S. troops increased from 12,000 to 150,000. The increase did nothing to improve long-term security. 
   During the constitutional referendum in the fall of 2005, troop levels increased by 22,000 soldiers, for a total of more than a 160,000 American service men and women in Iraq. Again, this increase, while limiting major violence during the referendum, did nothing to improve the long-term security in that particular area. 
   During Operation Together Forward, the Bush administration sent additional troops to Baghdad. The U.S.  military spokesman, General William Caldwell, stated this effort was a failure and had ``not met our overall expectations for sustaining a reduction in the level of violence.'' 
   Each of these instances has something in common. Each failed to improve the long-term security situation and the violence and death toll, which continues to rise. Even the Commander of U.S. Central Command has testified that top military commanders in Iraq do not believe increasing the number of troops is the right approach. He stated, in fact, more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more of their own responsibility. 
   We know the solution is not to send more troops to Iraq without a real plan to secure the peace. Fifty-five percent of Americans do not believe more troops can secure Baghdad, and 59 percent of Americans want redeployment of American forces, this includes two-thirds of the Latino population, who want our troops brought home. A study done by the Pew Hispanic Center found that 75 percent of Latinos now believe that the U.S. made the wrong choice in using military force in Iraq. 
   Americans, as you know, voted November 7 for a new direction in Iraq, and we must deliver that promise. Our Nation needs a policy to secure and stabilize Iraq, one that constructively engages in diplomacy and partners with our neighbors there. We need a plan that ensures that there are no permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq and a plan to decrease the U.S. presence there. We need a plan which investigates and punishes companies like Halliburton engaged in war profiteering and fraud, like the $1.4 billion in unreasonable and unsupported charges by Halliburton which the Defense Contract Audit Agency identified. 
   We need a policy and a plan to put welfare of our service men and women first so that they come home, rejoin their families and receive the care that they deserve. This should also include services for all of our veterans, both men and women.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate America Ferrera for winning the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy for her work in ABC's television show ``Ugly Betty.'' America Ferrera is a native of Los Angeles, the daughter of Honduran immigrant parents and a student at the University of Southern California, earning a degree in international relations. 
   As Betty Suarez, her character in ``Ugly Betty,'' Ferrera plays a smart, young Latina professional breaking into the publishing world. The people we see in here on television and in movies have a great influence on our communities and the attitudes of Americans. 
   While 40 percent of American youth ages 19 and under are children of color, few of the faces that they see on television actually reflect those races and cultures. Through her work, Ms. Ferrera is breaking down barriers for Latinos and Latinas in prime-time television. 
   I commend America Ferrera and everyone involved in Ugly Betty for helping to break down the stereotypes and provide a role model for young Latinas. I hope we can work together to teach everyone to appreciate diversity in our country. 
   Congratulations, America Ferrera.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I also rise in strong support of H.R. 5. 
   The high cost of education and the lack of adequate financial aid make obtaining a higher education unattainable for many of America's working families, including Latinos. This has been a great challenge for us in the last decade. 
   Since 2001, tuition and fees have jumped by 17 percent at private universities and by 41 percent at public universities and student loan interest rates have risen by 2 percent. According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, the cost of higher education will prevent 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college or institution. 
   Obtaining a higher education is especially difficult for Latinos, who face low family incomes, low financial aid awards and a reluctance to assume debt. The median household income for Latino families has fallen by over 4 percent over the past 5 years. 
   Latinos, as you know, represent about 15 percent of the college-age population, and yet only represent 12 percent of all undergraduates in U.S. colleges and universities and only represent 5 percent of those students in graduate schools. 
   Of all undergraduate students enrolled in the 2003-2004 academic year, 49 percent of Latino undergraduates were more likely to be first-generation students, much like myself. Fifty-one percent are enrolled on a part-time basis and the majority are coming from low income households. Yet Latinos receive the least financial aid of any ethnic group in the country. 
   Latinos and other low income communities deserve the security provided by an affordable higher education. H.R. 5 is part of that solution. Cutting the interest rate on subsidized student loans in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent will make college more affordable for many thousands and thousands of Latino students. 
   A higher education should not be a privilege and available only to the few. Today, we are fulfilling that promise by passing this bill, H.R. 5.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I stand here today in strong support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. 
   I was proud to cast my support for this bill earlier today and commend the democratic leadership for making college affordability one of our first items of business in the 110th Congress. 
   Our children's future is very important to America's families. A quality education is key to that future. 
   However, many of America's working families, including Latino families, struggle to provide this future for their children. 
   The high cost of an education and the lack of adequate financial aid makes obtaining a higher education unattainable. 
   Since 2001, tuition and fees at private universities have jumped by 17 percent after inflation. 
   At public universities tuition and fees have increased by 41 percent after inflation. 
   In addition to tuition and fees rising, interest rates on student loans have risen. 
   Over the last 5 years, the interest rates on student loans have jumped by almost 2 percent--further increasing the cost of college. 
   During the same period of time that tuition jumped by 41 percent, the median household income for Latinos fell by 4 percent. 
   Of the millions of student loan borrowers with need based loans, half have family incomes between $26,000 and $68,000. 
   According to the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 73 percent of Latino families had incomes below $62,240. Forty-seven 47 percent of Latino families have incomes less than $34,288 per year. 
   In 2005, the total cost of college for one Latino student was 32 percent of a median household's income for a public institution. 
   It nears 75 percent of a median household's income for a private institution. 
   Yet Latinos receive the least financial aid of any ethnic group, including Federal and non-Federal aid. 
   While the average total aid award for all undergraduates in 2003-04 was $6,890, Latinos  received the lowest average aid award of $6,250. 
   The high cost of higher education leaves many Latino students with no choice. 
   According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, the cost of a higher education will prevent 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade. 
   And would prevent another two million high school graduates from attending any college at all. 
   This road is especially difficult for Latinos, who face low family incomes, low financial aid awards and a reluctance to assume debt. 
   Latinos represent 15 percent of the college-age population, yet only 12 percent of all undergraduates in U.S. colleges and universities, and 5 percent of students in graduate programs. 
   Only 12 percent of Latinos over the age 25 have a bachelor's degree. 
   Of all undergraduates enrolled in the 2003-2004 academic year, 49 percent of Latino undergraduates were more likely to be first-generation students, 51 percent are enrolled on a part-time basis and the majority have low-incomes. 
   Latinos and other low income communities deserve the security provided by an affordable higher education. H.R. 5 is part of the solution. 
   Cutting the interest rate on subsidized student loans in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next five years will make college more affordable for thousands of Latino students. 
   In fact, this bill will save students with $13,800 in subsidized federal student loan debt approximately $4,400 over the life of their loan. 
   At a time when financial barriers are preventing millions of young Americans from attending college we must make college more affordable. 
   I was fortunate to have access to federal and state programs such as the Pell Grant and Work-Study Program. 
   As Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program, I was able to help students find ways to afford their college education. 
   As a former Member of the Rio Hondo Community College Board, I know the struggles our colleges face in providing services to students. 
   My experience taught me that access to higher education should not be a privilege available to a select few, but a right available to all. 
   Investing in affordable higher education for every child benefits our society as a whole. 
   Today we are fulfilling our promise to make college more affordable for students. 
   Cutting interest rates in half on student loans is the first step. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensuring our children--all of our children--have a brighter future through education.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support a strong reauthorization of the SCHIP program that prevents additional loss of health care access to U.S. citizen children. 
   Medicaid citizenship documentation created by the Deficit Reduction Act has caused citizen children to lose access to health care. Low-income white and black U.S. citizen children, not Latino citizens, are disproportionately affected. Documentation requirements are extremely burdensome to low-income families who often lack the resources to pay for that documentation. 
   In Alabama, Kansas and Virginia, Medicaid enrollment declined by a larger percentage among white and black children than among Latino children who were U.S. citizens. 
   The Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services and the past administrator of CMS concurred that there is no substantial evidence that undocumented immigrants are committing fraud in order to receive Medicaid. 
   Citizenship documentation, as implemented, is a flawed policy based on inaccurate assumptions that adversely affect our children's health. 
   I urge my colleagues to allow that we enforce a good SCHIP program. Take care of those 10 million children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the humanitarian aid situation in Cuba. Earlier this month, Cuba was struck by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which devastated the lives of about 11 million citizens of Cuba. 
   These hurricanes wiped out towns and destroyed about 500,000 homes, crops, roads, electrical service, water and other key infrastructure on that island. It's estimated that the damage will be anywhere from 4 to $10 billion. I just happened to be in south Florida this weekend and heard from many in the community, many Cuban Americans, who don't like the politics there, but understand that there has to be something done. 
   But because of a travel restriction implemented by the Bush administration in 2004, Cuban Americans in the United States are unable to send money back home or even travel. They are restricted by that travel. These restrictions do not reflect, in my opinion, the family values upon which our Nation was founded. Instead, they unfairly target families in need of this dire assistance. 
   We must temporarily lift these travel restrictions and remittances so that money can go to those families that are in so desperate need of assistance at this time. I ask for at least a temporary lifting of travel and remittances for at least 3 months.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago I visited our servicemen and women in Iraq. My visit confirmed my belief that we must support our troops and redeploy them. That is why I will vote for the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   When I met with the troops in Iraq, they told me that they lacked the basic equipment needed to do their job, like body armor, light bulbs for vehicles, and scissors for bandages and gauzes. In some cases, they told me that the equipment they use is unreliable due to excess use. Our troops are also concerned with the lengths of their tours in Iraq; they told me that they are not only demanding, but exhausting. Our troops are being overextended. For many of them, it is not their first tour, but their second or third. Many of them have missed the birth of their children or the death of their parents. 
   It is time for a new direction in Iraq. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act does that--it gives the American people the first step in a new direction to what our troops properly deserve. A new direction, with benchmarks for success in Iraq, with benchmarks that ensure our troops have the equipment and training they need, and a benchmark that guarantees a fully funded deployment out of Iraq. This bill makes it clear, and sends the message that the majority of Americans want--an end to the war. 
   In the last 4 years, we have spent close to $400 billion on the war in Iraq. The war on Iraq has claimed the lives of nearly 3,200 and more than 24,000 servicemen and women have been injured or permanently disabled. More than half of those will not be able to lead a normal life because of the severity of their injuries, impacting not only them but also their families. In the 32nd Congressional District of California which I represent, we have lost 13 sons to combat. Despite all this, the Administration has failed to outline concrete steps to end the war and has left our servicemen and women without adequate equipment and our veterans without proper care.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Chairman, today I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that I'm offering with my colleagues, Mr. Gilchrest, Mr. Carnahan and Mr. Kirk. 
   Climate impacts on developing countries could increase stresses on natural resources such as water, drought and agriculture and compromise public health for the world. Unfortunately, developing nations often have weak or unstable domestic infrastructures magnifying these impacts. 
   The growing security risk of an unstable climate have been widely noted. On April 17, 2007, the U.N. Security Council held an open debate on the issue of national security and climate change. The issue was also subject of discussion at the Winter Parliamentary Assembly meeting of the OSCE, which I'm a participant in, on February 2007 where I was able to talk about and give a key address on our bipartisan efforts here in the U.S. House. 
   A military advisory board, which included General Anthony Zinni, Admiral Richard Truly, Admiral Lopez and General Gordon Sullivan, concluded that climate change is the threat multiplier for instability and could push  already weak and failing governments toward authoritarianism and radical ideologies. As a result, the U.S. may be drawn more frequently into these situations to either provide stability or reconstruction. 
   This amendment, Members, builds on the recognition and requires the Department of State, the Agency for International Development, the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant agencies to assess specific needs of developing countries in adapting to climate changes. Based on the assessment, our amendment requires a strategy be submitted to the Congress to address these needs, including identification of existing funding and new funding sources which may be required for such purposes. 
   Please join us in building a foundation to secure developing countries from instability associated with climate change. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentlewoman from Colorado and also Congressman Castle for their leadership on this issue. 
   Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3. 
   Stem cell research, as you know, is a promising science that provides hope for millions of our families whose loved ones suffer from Parkinson's disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and, even more, diabetes. 
   And as one who chairs the Hispanic task force on health, I know how very important it is that research be done on diabetes treatment because Latinos have a disproportionate large number in our community that suffer from this illness. Puerto Rican Americans and Mexican Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes. The promising potential of stem cell research for those with diabetes provides a real opportunity to eliminate one of the most blatant health disparities for Latinos and African Americans. 
   Nearly three out of every four Americans support stem cell research. The American public have clearly stated that stem cell research is important to them and their families and their well-being. Let us make sure that we do the right thing today and we support this very important piece of legislation that went out of this House not too long ago. As a country, we have a moral obligation to support life, especially those who are ill and who need this treatment and cures. With stem cell research we would help to provide assistance to over 100 million Americans suffering from these various diseases. We cannot ignore a valuable research tool that might provide real cures for millions of Americans. 
   In my congressional district, the City of Hope, a grand research facility, is ready, willing and able to conduct promising cancer research using stem cells. For my constituents and for all Americans, I hope that we can remove this cumbersome limitation on federally funded research. 
   I urge my colleagues to strongly support H.R. 3.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (IMMIGRANT SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, tonight I stand here today to honor the contribution of immigrants that have been made to our Nation, particularly defending our Nation in support of comprehensive immigration reform. 
   We need effective legislation that strikes the right balance between national security and reforming our current immigration system. This should include a path to permanency for millions of law abiding and tax paying immigrants who call the United States their home. 
   It's my hope that the Senate finalizes debating their immigration reform bill, and that our Chamber continues to work to adopt legislation that will truly reform the system and enhance our Nation's security. 
   Immigrant families are an important part of our social fabric and our economy. Undocumented workers, you may not know, contribute as much as $7 billion a year in Social Security into our system and $1.5 billion in Medicare every year, yet do not collect those benefits. 
   Immigrants, you may know, play an important role in defending our Nation. In all of our wars throughout our history, immigrants have fought side by side and have given their lives to defending America's freedoms and ideals. 
   Twenty percent of the recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor that our Nation bestows on our war heroes, has been granted to sons and daughters of immigrants. Their bravery is proof that immigrants are as willing as any other Americans to defend our country's freedom, and their service is no less important and valuable because of their immigrant status. 
   For example, as of May 2006, 33,449 noncitizens served in our Armed Forces, and more than 26,000 servicemembers have become U.S. citizens since the Iraq war began, and 75 servicemembers received posthumous citizenship. 
   Immigrants make up 5 percent of all enlisted personnel on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, and immigrants continue to demonstrate that they are a part of this country through their service in the military. 
   Without the contribution of immigrants the military, as we know it today, could not meet its own recruiting goals. Without the assistance of immigrants, the military could not fill the need for foreign language translators, interpreters and cultural experts. 
   Immigrants provide unique incredibly valuable contributions to the military, and it's critical that we continue to recognize and appreciate their efforts and that of their families. 
   In the district I represent in California, we've unfortunately suffered several casualties, including that of immigrant servicemembers who gave their lives for our country. One is the fallen Marine Lance Corporal Francisco Martinez Flores who died while serving overseas in Iraq. At the age of 21, and only 2 weeks away from gaining U.S. citizenship, Francisco was killed in the line of duty. He was one of thousands of lawful permanent residents who have volunteered their service to protect the United States by joining the U.S. military. 
   On April 2003, Francisco was granted posthumous U.S. citizenship and Congress honored his memory by passing a bill that I authored to celebrate his life in the City of Duarte by naming a Post Office after him. 
   But in 2003, Sergeant Atanacio Haro-Marin, from the City of Baldwin Park, from my district from California also died in Iraq. He came under heavy enemy fire. This young man was born in Zacatecas, Mexico and moved to Los Angeles at 2 years of age. He'll be remembered as a proud and courageous soldier who was living out a long held dream of serving in the U.S. military and will be honored by having a Post Office named after him in the City of Baldwin Park. 
   The sacrifices that my constituents made inspired me to pursue legislation to help other legal permanent residents who risk their lives every day and die protecting our country's liberties and values, achieve the dream of becoming a citizen. 
   And in 2003, I introduced the Naturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act. The bill, which was included in the Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report, was signed into law, and recognizes the enormous contributions of immigrants in the military by providing them with easier access to naturalization and immediate family immigration protections for those killed in action. 
   It is a tribute to them and their families and all veterans for the enormous sacrifices they've made so we and others around the world can live in freedom. 
   I'm proud today to tell you that I support our military men and women, and especially those that continue to serve us that are legal permanent residents. We need to see an immigration reform program come forward that is comprehensive, and salute soldiers such as this who have given their ultimate sacrifice for our country.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong opposition to a free trade agreement with Colombia. The Colombian Government has ties with paramilitary organizations and international criminal networks. Each year more unionists are killed in Colombia than the rest of the world combined, many at the hands of country paramilitaries. Yet Colombia is not willing to investigate these murders and prosecute perpetrators. 
   In 2006, seventy-two trade unionists were assassinated. The perpetrators continue to enjoy 98 percent impunity. Colombia's labor laws also do not conform with ILO recommendations. A trade agreement with Colombia, in my opinion, could cost more U.S. jobs and increase our debt. It would further impoverish rural communities in Colombia and reduce access by Colombians to new medicines.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise very proudly in strong support of H.R. 3162, the CHAMP Act. 
   As policymakers, we have an obligation to make sure that children who are in the program do not lose their coverage and that those who are eligible for coverage but are not enrolled receive that care. 
   Millions of low-income children and seniors are depending on us to pass a bill so they can receive health care. The CHAMP Act will provide health care to 11 million poor children, reduce health care disparities in communities of color, and protect senior citizens who rightfully need access to their physicians. 
   Insured children are more likely to receive cost-effective, preventative services and are healthier, which leads to greater success in school and later on in life. 
   Although programs such as SCHIP and Medicaid have decreased the number of uninsured children, the lack of funding over the last 10 years and outreach efforts have left millions of children who are eligible from receiving this care. 
   More than 80 percent of uninsured African American and 70 percent of uninsured Latino children are eligible currently for public coverage but are not currently enrolled. In my district alone, 18,000 children go uninsured. The bill ensures that these children will receive that health care coverage. 
   Some would argue that this bill is a vote on immigration. I'm sorry, but  they are absolutely wrong. The bill restores State's options to provide the coverage that they need; and the bill ensures that citizens who have lost their birth certificates and other identification are not immediately denied care, like the more than 11,000 children in Virginia and 14,000 children in Kansas who have lost their coverage. 
   The bill helps one-third of Asian and Pacific Islander American seniors who live in linguistic isolation understand health care. 
   The bill does not provide services, and I underscore, does not provide services to undocumented immigrants. Those who say that are blatantly wrong. 
   I urge support of the bill. Let's move on. Let's do the right thing for our children. Vote for the CHAMP Act.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. Violent crimes committed against anyone because of their race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability should not be taken lightly. H.R. 1592 would make this kind of violent crime a Federal offense and authorizes Federal grants to assist state and local law enforcement agencies in prosecuting violent hate crimes. 
   I believe that it is necessary for the Federal Government to secure the lives of all people and bring justice to individuals who have been victims of a violent hate crime. By allowing the Federal Government jurisdiction in certain, limited cases of violent hate crime, this bill provides much-needed support to local law enforcement agencies. This piece of legislation is particularly important at a time when the number of hate groups has grown over the past years. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that the number of hate groups has seen a 40 percent increase since 2000 and attributed much of this growth to the immigration issue. 
   Hate crimes that are motivated by bigotry and bias against minority populations affect entire families and communities. We must stand to protect our communities from hateful actions. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1592.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. Head Start is a program that has been crucial on the development and academic success of our children for more than 40 years. 
   Since 1965, more than 24 million children have benefited from Head Start's comprehensive services and school readiness. Last year alone Head Start served about 900,000 children nationwide--over 98,000 children in my home State of California and nearly 6,500 children, more than 60 percent Latino, in the 32nd Congressional District of California, which I represent. 
   In addition to providing these comprehensive services, Head Start programs engage parents as partners in their children's education. Parents volunteer at their child's school site and many become Head Start teachers. Head Start has a proven track record of improving the lives of low-income children and families. It narrows the gap between disadvantaged children and all children in vocabulary and writing skills. It also leads to continued improvements in word knowledge, letter recognition, and math and writing skills relative to other children during their kindergarten year. 83 percent of Head Start children are at the national norm by the time they reach kindergarten. 
   Studies also demonstrate that Head Start programs improve the well-being of the children and families they serve, providing health and dental services to children and families who might otherwise not have them. Head Start programs benefit parents as well. Head Start parents report increases in education attainment and employment during their time affiliation with Head Start. In California, 24 percent of Head Start employees are or were Head Start parents. In addition, 86 percent of Head Start volunteers in California are current or former parents of the local Head Start program. 
   The Improving Head Start Act of 2007, H.R. 1429, not updates this program so all children could be put in the road for academic success. It makes significant improvements that will help strengthen educational outcomes for students, ensure better coordination with local school districts, improve teacher quality, and increase program eligibility. It would help improve Head Start's workforce quality by increasing funding for teacher and staff salaries and professional development. This includes providing funds for training personnel in addressing the unique needs of migrant and seasonal working families, families of children with disabilities, limited english proficient families and homeless families. It will also expand access to up to 10,000 more children and will strengthen school readiness by re-evaluating and updating current standards and assessments based on best science. 
   H.R. 1429 also reserves 5 percent of the total Head Start appropriation for the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program. This is important because the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program serves some of the country's neediest working families and is designed to meet the unique challenges and opportunities faced by the children of farmworkers. 
   At a time when America needs to be at the forefront of innovation and education, programs like Head Start are an investment in our future workforce and their success. I applaud the members of the Committee on Education and Labor for their work on the reauthorization of this important program. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1429 and to oppose any proposal that would block this grant program or would allow government-funded religious discrimination in Head Start programs. Supporting this bill is supporting our Nation's future.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act, which the House will consider today. 
   This bill would create a national affordable housing trust fund to be administered by HUD, the Housing and Urban Development Department. The trust would increase the supply of decent quality affordable housing, especially for low-income families. 
   Owning a home is an American value, but many are not able to acquire that dream. With rising housing costs throughout the country, affordable housing for low-income Americans has become nearly impossible. 
   For example, in 2006 Los Angeles County residents needed to make at least $50,000 a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment. That income is significantly more than what social workers, preschool teachers, and in-home health care aides earn on average. The gap between wages and housing costs in Los Angeles County and nationwide has skyrocketed. 
   I urge my colleagues today to vote for the final passage of H.R. 2895 so we can help all our constituents realize the American Dream.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank our chairman from the Labor Committee. I want to urge our Members here today to vote on this very important bill, H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Our colleagues, Rosa DeLauro, and others, have championed this bill for many years. But Rosa has really dedicated herself to this movement. I am happy to be a cosponsor of this bill. She understands, as we know and many woman know, that we have to recognize that there are inequities that exist in our communities, and especially among women and women of color. 
   Some of you may know that while women overall only receive 77 cents on the dollar, Latinas only average 57 cents on that dollar, and African American women only get 68 cents on the dollar. 
   Indeed, there are disparities that exist and continue. We have an obligation here in this House to do the right thing. 
   Just today, this morning, Arnold Schwarzenegger, our Governor, cut the payroll for many State employees. Many of them are women. They are the earners for their households. They have to put food on the table. Now they are going to be making Federal minimum wage, which is less than what the State of California's minimum wage is. What an atrocity. 
   I am not going off message, I am just trying to strike home a point that it's important to take care of all those that work in our society, but particularly women because they are the ones that are mostly discriminated against, and we have to cut that out. 
   Again, I want to wholeheartedly offer my support and have my colleagues know that I stand first and foremost for pay equity for all of us. I ask you to vote for H.R. 1338.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (NATURALIZATION APPLICATION BACKLOG -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss the naturalization application backlog at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Agency, known as USCIS. 
   In July 2007, the Bush administration raised the naturalization fee application by 66 percent, from $400 to $675. The fee increase was meant to improve the process of these applications. Yet, recent reports state that the USCIS is months behind in scheduling, so they aren't even beginning to process these applications. 
   The Department of Homeland Security estimates it will take 16 to 18 months to process these applications that have been filed by June 1, 2007. These delays are going to hinder hundreds of thousands of people from exercising their vote to be a part of history, the Presidential elections that are coming up in November. How abysmal this is for us to give that information to so many people who are playing by the rules, who are waiting in line to become U.S. citizens. These are people from across the world waiting in line. We have to do something. I urge my colleagues to step up to the plate.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of legislation that I recently introduced, H.R. 1968, the Community Health Workers Act of 2007. 
   The bill provides Federal support for community health workers, also known as promotoras. Community health workers conduct education and provide prevention information on chronic illnesses to communities of color, the Asian, Latino, African American and even Native American communities. They are able to reach out to patients in ways that traditional health care providers can't, through culturally and linguistically appropriate care. They are trusted by their communities. 
   Families who interacted with community workers were eight times more likely to obtain health insurance for their children, and their children stayed insured. That is why I strongly believe that the community health workers need to be part of the SCHIP reauthorization bill moving forward in the House. 
   As the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' Health Task Force, I am committed to reducing health care disparities in our country. The legislation will help achieve that goal, and I am proud to have the support of other colleagues here today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss poverty and homelessness in the San Gabriel Valley in the 32nd Congressional District. At least 43 percent of adults living below the Federal poverty line in L.A. County have worked either full-time or part-time. They have to balance rent or mortgage payments, child care, food, gas prices, and health care. The increasing costs can lead to homelessness if you can't make these payments. 
   In Los Angeles County, over 152,000 people are homeless over the course of a year; and in the city of Azusa, at least 1,500 children were homeless last year. 
   I am proud that Democrats have taken steps to reduce poverty and homelessness. In 2007, our farm bill raised the minimum benefit in the food stamp program for the first time in 30 years. For the first time in more than 10 years, we have raised the minimum wage and expanded American homeownership, and also would help to provide and ensure that low-income and middle-income families have affordable mortgage loans.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (OPTIMISM -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today on a lighter note, I would like to talk about optimism and the wherewithal that our country has, especially among our young people. I want to talk about a subject that doesn't really get a lot of attention in this whole debate about energy and oil and the fact that we are now faced with skyrocketing prices at the gas pump. 
   I want to talk about investing in our future. I want to talk about young people not only from my district but across the country, and I want to talk about what we call green jobs, green-collar jobs. Some people might think that's a misnomer, you know, but we have actually changed. Blue-collar jobs have, as you know, been outsourced to other countries. 
   What we are attempting to do in the Congress and something that President Bush signed into law just last December was an act that was part of the energy bill, the energy package, that said we are going to make a difference in this country by investing in America's future. We will provide 10 million jobs in green technology if our government steps up to the plate. 
   Now we are asking for that appropriation for $125 million to help create, and, I think, minimally, 10 million jobs, that will be reaped across this country that will secure our energy security here at home. It will also send a steep message to many nonbelievers across the country that we mean business, that we are actually going to keep these jobs here, that these jobs won't be outsourced, that they won't be going to China and India and Indonesia and even to Mexico, because we are going to make an investment here. 
   It's, very simply, trying to set a precedent here to provide opportunities for people to get retrained or to get into new technology, into are renewable energy, into biofuels, and into creating solar panels. Those manufacturing jobs that we knew as blue-collar workers that my father as a teamster and other people in my district represented, could be retooled to help provide and incentivize our economy by keeping those jobs here at home. 
   No more of this minimum-wage jobs, but providing good, sustainable, liveable-wage jobs for working men and women and people that could rely on this to raise a family, not in the state that we are in right now, where you have a single head of household, a woman, in many cases, that's working three jobs just to make that rent, just to make that electricity bill, just to get that extra gallon of gas to get to her job. Those are things that we know are resonating right now with our constituents, and they demand a change. 
   It isn't just enough to say that we are going to lower the energy costs, they have to have a good-paying job to provide for all those commodities, luxuries that they need to keep their family going.     
   And one best way of doing it is by jump-starting the economy and by supporting the Green Jobs Act, something that the Senate and also the House passed again that was signed into law in December. We need $125 million to help jump-start that program. 
   I want to illustrate something here, a picture of some youngsters who were actually installing on a roof, who had just completed a project in Oakland, California, who were trained in a program, who went through an apprenticeship program that was done in a private and public partnership. It was to help install solar panels and to retrofit them in some of our oldest buildings in very dilapidated parts of our country. 
   What an incentive that would be to help to jump-start our communities and to revitalize those communities that have been left behind by the manufacturing jobs that went to other countries but also to incentivize those places that have high unemployment like in Oakland, like in East Los Angeles, like in the Bronx, like in Little Havana in Florida. These places need relief, and the government has an obligation to help provide an incentive, working closely, hand in hand, with private industry. 
   The reason I say that is that I know it works, and it's working right now in an obscure place in my district in East Los Angeles. The LA Unified School District, which doesn't always get honors for many things that they do, has invested in a program out of the East LA Skills Center to help retrain individuals. The majority of those who are participating right now happen to be middle-aged people who are saying, ``I need to get retrained into a better paying job, a job that's going to help me in the rest of my life and in my retirement.'' They're taking that challenge; they're going through training, and they're being offered jobs. 
   One of the dilemmas that we're facing right now is that we don't have an adequate workforce available to fill all of these potential jobs. I say: Why? Why should we go outside and bring people in when we need to make those investments here in the United States and in Los Angeles? 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say and would like to urge my colleagues to support the Green Jobs Act and to provide that infusion of $125 million that will act as a stimulus package for our economy.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (MEDICARE LEGISLATION -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Good morning to my colleagues. 
   As you recall, last month before the House adjourned for the July 4th recess, we passed legislation that would treat seniors and the disabled through Medicare. The legislation passed with strong bipartisan support with Democrats and Republicans recognizing the need to pass this legislation. Last week, the Senate finally followed our lead and passed the bill. Senator Kennedy courageously returned to Capitol Hill to lodge that vote. 
   The legislation is now sitting on the President's desk. He has a decision to make. Will he side with private insurers or will he support seniors and the disabled? A veto-proof majority in the House and Senate has now passed legislation that strengthens Medicare and ensures our seniors and disabled that they have access to a doctor that they know and trust. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush should drop his veto threat and join our Members in the House in support of legislation that puts seniors first and the disabled and strengthens a great program known as Medicare. He should sign the Medicare legislation as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise with my colleagues to support the overriding of the President's veto on this legislation that will protect our seniors. Did you know that over 44 million vulnerable Medicare patients are depending on us to pass this bill? By vetoing the legislation, President Bush is ignoring the needs of our seniors, the disabled individuals and our doctors. 
   Less than a month ago, Congress passed the bill by a margin of 355-59. I voted for the bill so I could help ensure that 70,000 Medicare beneficiaries, patients in my district, would be able to receive their continued health care. The bill includes programs that help low-income Medicare patients, including low-income Latinos. Although Latinos make up only 6 percent of the overall Medicare beneficiaries, more than 14 percent are considered low-income seniors. Allowing a 10 percent cut would be devastating to patient providers practicing in communities like mine in East Los Angeles. 
   I have heard from many of my constituents that some California physicians, even in my own district, are considering not taking any more Medicare patients because of the inadequate reimbursement rate. Even less access would be imposed upon a community that is already faced with health care disparities and being able to access health care. Organizations across the country understand the importance of this piece of legislation including AARP and the American Medical Association. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues, Members of Congress, to help us override the President's misguided veto and to stand first and foremost for our seniors and those disabled Americans that are counting on our work here in the Congress.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening in strong support of House Resolution 1077. 
   At the end of March, I traveled to India with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation and met with the leader of Tibet, His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. We met young Tibetan children in India and saw hope in their eyes for a better future. We were greeted by many thousands and thousands of Tibetans along the road as we traveled up the mountain where they lived. Yet we heard stories of violence and torture inflicted by the Chinese Government on the Tibetan people and protesters. We learned of recent Chinese policies and laws that have limited the economic opportunities for Tibetans in China and severely endangered the Tibetan culture, religion and their language, in fact, their whole being. 
   Tibetans have fled to India to be able to practice their religion in peace and preserve their culture with dignity and respect. The Dalai Lama spoke to us about his desire for peace and his longing to live autonomously, not independent of, but autonomously in China so that Tibetans could practice their religion openly. 
   I, too, share his desire. House Resolution 1077 calls on China to end its repression inside Tibet, release prisoners who participated in nonviolent protest, and to begin a dialogue, a true dialogue with the Dalai Lama to find a solution for Tibet that respects human rights. The resolution calls for access for journalists so that the world can see, hear and view the situation in Tibet. 
   The Tibetan people are at a critical point in their movement to live peacefully and autonomously. We must  stand with them. We must also be a beacon of hope for them and for those thousands of children that we saw at the orphanage there. They greeted us with hearts open to us with flags both representing the U.S. Government and the Tibetan people. 
   I stand here, Members, strongly supportive of House Resolution 1077 and ask you to join with us and the Speaker of the House for its swift passage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, a budget is a blueprint of a party's values. This week, Democrats will bring a budget to the House floor that cares for our children and our families without raising taxes. 
   For the first time in 6 years, we have an opportunity to pass a budget that actually finds balance in the next 5 years, something that Republicans never did while they controlled the House and something the President continues to refuse to do. We want to get our fiscal house in order so that our children are not forced to pay off our debts decades from now. At the same time we are paying down our debt, we also invest in our children, making sure they have access to quality health care and to quality education. 
   The Democratic budget substantially increases the S-CHIP program, which will allow our States to insure millions of children who are now uninsured. In California, it is known as the Healthy Families program. We also provide $7.9 billion over the President's budget for education funding, which includes No Child Left Behind, special education and helping students better afford college. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget values our children and puts them first while investing in our country.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to opportunities of job growth and hopefully eradicating poverty through a green economy. 
   A major national investment in renewable energy could create potentially 3.5 million green-collar jobs over the next 10 years. 
   We must say to America's workers, particularly those in urban and rural underserved communities, there is a place for you in the green economy. Investment should not only be improving infrastructure, but improving economic opportunities for all. That is why I am proud to be working with Congressman JOHN TIERNEY and others to create a green jobs bill that will create pathways out of poverty. 
   Job training can lead to self-sufficiency and prosperity through higher wages, access to benefits and more career choices. Other cities and States throughout the country have taken the lead to shape the new economy, which is creating demand for green products and services. 
   Under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, Congress has taken steps to ensure our Nation has a secure energy future. I hope that ensuring underserved communities achieve economic security can be a part of this green future.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (HEALTH CARE ISSUES AFFECTING MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for the opportunity to serve as moderator for this special designated time for recognition under Special Orders for celebration of health care, and, in particular, the uninsured. 
   Tonight I have several colleagues who will be joining me to speak on different topics with respect to health care issues affecting minority communities. Just to give you a brief summary of some of the topics we will touch on, obviously reauthorization of SCHIP, language access, obesity, diabetes, cancer, tobacco, HIV and AIDS, health professions, community health workers, environmental health and Medicaid citizenship. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to recognize National Minority Health Month. This week is Covering the Uninsured Week. Tonight you are going to hear from some of my colleagues representing the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and their efforts to improve health care in our communities. 
   Did you know that life expectancy and overall health have improved in recent years for large numbers of Americans due to an increase in and focus on preventive medicine and new advances in medical technology? However, not all Americans are faring that well, particularly communities of color, which continue to suffer from significant disparities in overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality and survival rates in the population, as compared to the health status of the general population. 
   The National Minority Health Month was launched in an effort to eliminate health disparities and to improve health status of minority populations across the country. This month was created in response to Healthy People 2010, a set of comprehensive health objectives established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Disparities continue to persist, and we must eliminate health disparities by identifying significant opportunities to improve health care. 
   There are disparities in the burden of illness and death experienced by African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and American Indian and Alaskan Natives as compared to the U.S. population as a whole. 
   I am pleased to once again be working with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific Islander Caucus to develop a comprehensive tri-caucus health disparities bill. Our bill will address the importance of language access, health professions, training, data collection and health coverage for immigrants. Our colleagues in the Senate are also working on a disparities bill, and I hope that they too will pass legislation that will truly save the lives of millions of minorities. We must do more to better the health of our population, which includes all communities of color. 
   With that, I want to just briefly touch on this issue of the uninsured. Today marks the start of the fifth year of Covering the Uninsured Week. Although the United States has one of the best health care systems in the world, not everyone has the means to access our health care system. The number of uninsured people affects us all and is a national problem that needs a national solution. 
   We all know that lack of health insurance results in reduced access to care. Access can be defined as the ability to get to health services, receive service at the right time, and obtain the appropriate services necessary to promote the best health outcomes possible. 
   Reduced access could mean that someone is less likely to have regular sources of care, less likely to receive preventive services and more likely to use emergency departments as primary sources of care. The long-term consequences of reduced access to care include lower quality of life, higher mortality rates and the decline of the population's overall health. 
   Despite the growth of our economy, the number of uninsured persons continues to increase. In 2005, more than 44 million people were uninsured, and of that number, 14 million were Latinos. 
   The cost of private health insurance continues to rise astronomically, and we hear that every single day when we go back home to our districts. Health insurance premiums continue to rise by double-digit rates each year, and over 80 percent of the uninsured come from working families, people who are working and getting a paycheck. While two-thirds of uninsured children are eligible for public programs such as Medicaid and the SCHIP program, most are still uninsured. 
   These adults also are low-income populations who are not eligible for public programs but have incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. This group is composed predominantly of parents and childless adults who work but may have difficulty in obtaining and affording coverage. Due to the low Medicaid eligibility level for parents, many uninsured parents have children who qualify for public coverage but do not qualify, themselves, as parents. What an irony. 
   Members of racial and ethnic minority groups make up a large number, a disproportionate share, of the uninsured population. The uninsured rate for Latinos was 33 percent in 2005, 20 percent for African Americans and 18 percent for Asians and 30 percent for Native Americans. They lack health care coverage. 
   In addition to impacting health and the finances of 
   the uninsured themselves, the lack of health care coverage has had repercussions for all of us in America. Many hospitals, as you know, are currently struggling under the strain of providing uncompensated emergency care to uninsured individuals. 
   In my own district in California, community health centers bear the brunt of responsibility for treating the uninsured. These community health centers are often the first place that the uninsured turn to when seeking health care services. These community health centers are a vital part of our health care safety net. 
   Poor health leads to poor financial status, and a never-ending cycle of low socioeconomic status often leads to poor health. The core values for a strong and secure America should include the right to universal access to affordable, high-quality health care for all. 
   In a country that prides itself on equality, it is evident that our health  care system is broken when people suffer from a lack of access to health insurance and to quality care. We must make health care services affordable and provide quality through linguistically and culturally competent services for all Americans. That must be our national priority. 
   I want to refer myself to the State Children's Health Insurance program, known by many as SCHIP, which covers currently 6 million children, building on Medicaid's coverage of 28 million children. However, statistically speaking, 9 million children remain uninsured. 
   Over the past decade, SCHIP and Medicaid together have reduced the uninsured rate among low-income children by one-third. We know that uninsured children are more likely to receive cost-effective preventive services and are healthier, which leads to greater success in school and life. Although programs such as SCHIP and Medicaid have decreased the number of uninsured children, the lack of funding and outreach efforts have left millions of those children ineligible without any coverage. Reducing disparities in children's access to health care is extremely important and should be one of our biggest priorities here in Congress. 
   For example, uninsured African American and Latino children are less likely to have a personal doctor and are more likely to forego needed medical care than any other group of uninsured children. More than half of insured African American children, 51 percent, and insured Latino children, 50 percent, are covered by Medicaid and SCHIP. Nearly 95 percent of eligible but uninsured children live in families with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is $33,200 for a family of three, and over 40 percent of this population is Latino. 
   Enrollment in SCHIP has proven to reduce disparities in access to health care services as well as reducing the coverage gap for minority children. More than 80 percent of African American children and 70 percent of uninsured Latino children appear to be eligible for this public coverage, but currently are not enrolled. 
   Additional funding for SCHIP, as you know, is necessary for the coverage of all uninsured. SCHIP plays a critical role for children of color. After SCHIP was created back in 1997, the percent of uninsured children steadily declined from a high of 15.4 percent in 1998 to a low of 10 percent in 2004, and for racial and ethnic minorities the decline was remarkable. In 1998, roughly 30 percent of Latino children, 20 percent of African American, and 18 percent of Asian Pacific Islander children were uninsured. In 2004, those numbers had dropped to about 21 percent, 12 percent and 8 percent respectively. 
   In addition to reducing the coverage gap for minority children, SCHIP enrollment has helped to reduce disparities in access to health care services. For example, a study of children enrolled in New York's SCHIP program for one year found an almost complete elimination of these disparities and the number of children with unmet health care needs decreased. A study from California's SCHIP population confirmed those results as well. Across racial and ethnic groups, SCHIP enrollment was associated with a significant reduction in disparities and access to needed care. 
   We need adequate SCHIP reauthorization. Currently there is insufficient Federal funding for SCHIP to cover the children currently enrolled. We need additional money to cover them and to expand coverage to uninsured children who are eligible. 
   In order to expand health coverage for minority children, we also need to address the underlying barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and SCHIP that minorities are more likely to face; as an example, the distrust of government and a health care system where language may not be spoken adequately to the different groups that are affected. And misinformation about eligibility rules is often complicating the process for many who don't understand the paperwork. 
   Enrollment strategies targeted to minority communities, including the use of community health workers, known as promotoras, could help guide families through the enrollment process and have been proven to increase enrollment and reduce disparities. We must improve outreach efforts and simplify enrollment in order to reach the millions of unenrolled children from communities of color who are eligible for Medicaid and the SCHIP program. This year, with the reauthorization of SCHIP, this is an opportunity for us to address racial and ethnic disparities in children's access to health care. I hope that we can work together with our colleagues across the aisle to begin the debate and see that we reauthorize these programs that are so vitally needed. 
   I am very pleased this evening to have one of my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Guam, who has chaired the Congressional Asian Pacific Islander Caucus Task Force on Health who has joined me this evening. She has been a pioneer on health care access and will give us, I am sure, very informative data regarding the problems that are faced currently in the Asian Pacific Islander community. I welcome her this evening.

   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his kind words and knowledge and always helping Members to better organize their messages, particularly when it comes to health care and the need to improve access for all people in our great country. 
   As the gentleman says, the fact is that we are undergoing a change where our populations are exploding, our minority populations have increased, and we don't see more services provided, one of which is the Native American population. I have a significant Native American population in L.A. County and there is one center available for them. It is just horrifying to think that people have to travel so many counties just to get there. Lord help them if they have an episode of some sort, that they get there in time to receive the necessary care. To know that this is not a priority with the administration is very alarming. We need to prioritize this issue.     
   I again want to recognize my colleague from Guam to talk about some other very pressing health care issues that affect not just Asian Pacific Islanders but these other minority populations. So I would yield to her.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for joining us this evening and representing the caucus so well, the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, and demonstrating a willingness to work across the aisle and in a coalition so that we can better improve access to health care for all underrepresented groups. 
   I want to talk very briefly before I recognize one of our other colleagues who has joined us here from the Congressional Black Caucus, Sheila Jackson-Lee. 
   I want to talk about diabetes because diabetes, in my opinion, is one of the major chronic illnesses. It does not just affect ethnic minority or underrepresented groups, but many, many people in our country. 
   One of the goals that I mentioned earlier of the Healthy People 2010 program, a campaign underway, by the way, by the Department of Health and Human Services, is to reduce the disease and economic burden of diabetes and to improve the quality of life for all people who have or are at risk of getting diabetes. 
   Diabetes, as you know, is a chronic disease affecting both children, Type I, and adults, Type II. The number of people with diabetes has increased steadily in the past decade, and the increase has occurred within certain racial and ethnic groups. 
   Today, approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and of these people, an estimated 6.2 million individuals have not even been diagnosed. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another 54 million people have pre-diabetes. 
   Complications of diabetes include heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney  failure, dental disease, pregnancy complications and amputations. These are very serious illnesses, and diabetes is now the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and costs the Nation over $132 billion per year in direct and indirect costs. 
   Diabetes, as you know, is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations, and about 150 amputations per day are due to diabetes. 
   Two million Latinos have been diagnosed with diabetes, and Latinos are 1.5 times more likely to have diabetes than whites, on the average, and many children with Type II diabetes are Latino or African American. 
   Reducing the incidence of diabetes and thus reducing racial and ethnic disparities involves diet and lifestyle changes. However, strategies to manage the disease and prevent the disease also need to be culturally sensitive and targeted to specific populations. 
   The number of overweight minority children has increased in recent years, and more of them are being diagnosed with adult-type diabetes. It is estimated that now at least 40,000 children now have Type II diabetes, which is the type of diabetes associated with adult obesity. 
   Regular diets of low-cost, high-calorie fast food and sodas, in addition to inadequate daily physical activity, have contributed to the prevalence of diabetes. Health education, as you know, is extremely important, and we need to teach people how to prevent diabetes because it is preventable. For people who already have diabetes, we need to teach them how to manage that disease. 
   In order to prevent or delay complications and early death from diabetes, patients need to understand the disease, take charge of blood glucose management, comfortably talk to their provider about diabetes care, and have access to equipment, supplies and prescriptions. Cultural competence and access to health care play a very large role in preventing deaths due to diabetes. 
   Sixty percent of my district, as you know, is Latino, and I have seen firsthand the community clinics that have helped my constituents who are diagnosed with this deadly but preventable disease. A large proportion of the people who visit these clinics in my district are uninsured. When I see the packed waiting rooms, I understand how hard it is to manage this chronic illness. Even with appointments, people can have waiting times of several hours, resulting in loss of work. 
   A 2005 Commonwealth Fund study of public hospitals also found that African American and Latino patients were less likely than their white counterparts to have well-controlled diabetes, and uninsured patients received even less care. Public hospitals serve a high number of patients at high risk for not receiving access to needed health care. In the study, about two out of five patients with diabetes were uninsured, and two-thirds were members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and up to two-thirds of patients primarily spoke a language other than English. 
   Insurance status and race influences health care use and outcomes for diabetes patients. Uninsured patients have the worst diabetes control, and 33 percent do not have their condition under control now, which is almost double the rate for Medicare patients. 
   The routine costs for managing diabetes, to test and control glucose levels, can reach hundreds of dollars per month. Uninsured patients have difficulties paying for equipment to effectively manage their treatment. Consequently, the higher prevalence of diabetes and the inability to manage diabetes leads to more diabetes-related deaths in communities of color. 
   This is just one example of how social determinants impact our health care status, and I wanted to draw your attention to that. 
   This evening we have been joined by two members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and I would first like to recognize the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). Thank you for joining us this evening.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining us this evening. 
   Before I conclude with our discussion on the uninsured and celebrating, actually, a call to action, a call to action  for all people of color and all Americans, that we have a balanced health care system that serves all of us, one last item I would like to bring up, before I recognize the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for the last 5 minutes is to talk a little bit about one of the biggest killers in our community, and it is about tobacco. Each year tobacco use kills more than 400,000 Americans and costs our country more than $96 billion in health care costs. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tobacco use by pregnant women alone costs at least $400 million per year due to complications such as low birth weight, premature birth and sudden infant death syndrome. Every day, 1,000 kids become regular smokers, one-third of whom will die prematurely as a result. Smoking is responsible for 87 percent of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. 
   Tobacco-related cancers are disproportionately higher among low-income and ethnic-minority communities. Because these groups have been repeatedly targeted by the tobacco industry, they unfairly carry a greater weight of the health and economic burden tobacco has in our country. For communities of color, tobacco addiction brings a disproportionate amount of death and disease to communities with low rates of health insurance coverage. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer among Latino men and second leading cause of death among Latinas. 
   Approximately 25,000 Latinos will die from smoking-related illnesses this year, surpassing all other causes of cancer. Each year, approximately 45,000 African Americans die from smoking-caused illness. 
   Native American adults have the highest tobacco use rates for all major ethnic groups. The prevalence of smoking is 37.5 percent among Native American, 26.7 among African American, and 24 percent among white men. This year it is expected that the rate of lung and cancer deaths for white males will be 73.8 per 100,000, while for African Americans it will be 98.4 per 100,000. Tobacco use is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death among Latinos. 
   Unfortunately, tobacco companies have increased their marketing to our minority communities, and I have seen advertisements in magazines popular with Latino youth. RJ Reynolds is running ads for Kool cigarettes with images that appeal to Latinos. 
   I recently learned that the Kool Mixx campaign focused its marketing images around music and hip-hop, which appeals to African American and Latino youth. The Kool Mixx campaign included 14 music concerts around the country and a DJ competition, as well as a special theme park with cartons displayed on them. 
   In addition, the tobacco company placed advertisements in publications popular with Latino youth, like this one here, including ``Latina'' and ``Cosmopolitan en Espanol.'' The ads include slogans like: ``It's about pursuing your ambitions and staying connected to your roots.'' To reach everybody in our community, they not only use attractive Latino models, but they also make sure ads are in English and Spanish. 
   The cigarette companies have focused on African American populations as well. One company created a line of cigarette flavors like Caribbean Chill and Mocha Taboo and used images of African Americans to promote their cigarettes. This targeted marketing is having an impact on the rates that we are seeing, higher number of people smoking. In 2005, 22 percent of Latino high school students smoked, a 19 percent increase over 2003, when the smoking rate was down to 18 percent. 
   Smoking continues to be a huge public health risk for us, and we must not tolerate it in our communities. We have to stand up to these big corporations and say, enough advertising, let's speak the truth, let's talk about prevention, let's talk about awareness, let's talk about alternative lifestyles so we can have healthier communities. 
   I am pleased that we were able to entertain this discussion on the uninsured, the celebration of Uninsured Week and to talk about the disparities that exist in our communities and communities of color. 
   I am pleased to give the remainder of my time to the distinguished woman from the Virgin Islands, who is chairperson of the task force for the Black Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Los Angeles, Congresswoman Watson, for holding this special event here for us to talk about one of our colleagues. 
   You know, I haven't been here very long in the Congress; but when I came in 2001, I knew that I had a friend here. Juanita Millender-McDonald at that time served as caucus Chair for the Women's Caucus and led the fight in so many ways for justice for women. And particularly, as a woman of color, she knew how deeply important it was to set herself up as a role model for all of us. 
   I remember her coming back and talking to me about events she did in her district. Every year annually she would raise funds and give grants out to domestic violence shelters and programs, and how she would have a big event with her community, and she kept inviting me. Hilda, you have got to see what we are doing out in our area; and it is something that you should take a look at. 
   She was there. She fought so hard for us during the Women's Caucus as she served her tenure, helping to promote women in the military. And she was very adamantly strongly, strongly supportive of women in the military. 
   And I know that her family, right now, needs our prayers and thoughts, and we send those from our community and from my family, from my husband and myself, and want to thank her for all that she did to fight for us, for our transportation funding in Southern California, for the ACE project, which affects so many of the L.A. delegation members, and for her strong work and advocacy for people of color affected by HIV and AIDS. 
   So I want to thank her. And it is fitting to say that this evening, because this evening, after we finish our discussions here, we are going to talk about the uninsured. And Lord knows that our communities of color share a heavy burden, disparate treatment, disparities that exist with chronic illnesses, and one of those being cancer, particularly African-American women who many, many times go undiagnosed. We need to do more in this area. And so we think of her today. We honor her, and we thank her family for the time that she served with us here on Earth.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (H.R. 3688), which would implement a trade agreement reached last year between Peru and the Bush Administration. 
   The Peru free trade agreement (FTA) will not protect American workers nor will it protect workers in Peru. The Peruvian National Convention on Agriculture (CONVEAGRO) has estimated that approximately 1.7 million Peruvian farmers will be negatively affected by the agreement. Although efforts were made to incorporate international labor standards in the Peru FTA, it is unclear whether the Bush Administration will enforce this provision. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has stated that the Peruvian government needs to change labor laws to be in compliance with international treaties. 
   Serious concerns also remain about language in the Peru FTA that does not eliminate the excessive North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Chapter 11 foreign investor privileges. These investor privileges create incentives for U.S. firms to move offshore. These investor privileges have also been used to undermine efforts to protect the environment and public health. The provisions also allow foreign investors to bring suits before tribunals to challenge the government's implementation of natural resource contracts or leases, which have the potential to continue threatening the resources in Peru. For that reason, environmental organizations have expressed significant concerns about this trade agreement even though improvements were made to help stop the flow of illegally logged timber in Peru. 
   The United States trade policy has resulted in a loss of at least three million manufacturing jobs since 1999 and a loss of nearly one million textile and apparel industries jobs in the last 13 years. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute showed that a typical American working household lost more than $2,000 in wages because of foreign trade. Further expansion of this policy could worsen conditions for workers in America that is why this legislation is opposed by groups such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Change to Win, Service Employees International Union, UNITE HERE, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Friends of the Earth, and the Sierra Club. I cannot vote for this legislation when our trade policy does not protect American workers and American jobs. In this new age of globalization, Congress must restore the economic security of working- and middle-class Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Today I stand boldly in support of this Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act. 
   Madam Speaker, 800,000 children, as you know, in the State of California are covered by this program. It is essential that we continue to provide that coverage. But many, many low-income and minority children will not be covered because previously this President vetoed our bill twice where we would have taken this farther. Instead of the 6 million that are currently in the program, it would have gone to 10 million children. But we can't talk about that now. 
   But one thing is sure, our constituents, our seniors, are telling us we also need to provide a fix for our doctors because many of our seniors that are on low-income assistance now need to see their doctors, and we know how vitally important that is. 
   Each and every one of us has an obligation to provide support for the very vulnerable in our communities. And I think there is a saying somewhere, maybe in the Bible, that says we will be judged by how we deal with those that are most vulnerable. And those are our frail, elderly and our children. 
   I know we can do better. I also pray that we have better outcomes after 2008, because I do believe that our public, our constituents, are demanding that we step up to the plate on health care. That is the number one priority that we are reading about throughout this country, that we cannot stand behind and not speak up here on the House, on the floor and demand that we have better coverage for all of our populations. I speak not only as a Latina and as a woman representing a low-income community, but I think I speak for many millions of people who would like to hear their Congresspeople speaking out loud and shouting out loud about the need for better health care coverage. They are demanding it. Yes, as my former colleague said on the floor, we will probably see those results change once November 2008 arrives. 
   Merry Christmas to the Congress.

   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, President Bush and the congressional Republicans refuse to face the facts on the expiration of the President's Protect America Act, and instead continue their false and misleading scare tactics that are not productive and will do nothing to protect our Nation. 
   Republicans continue to claim that the expiration of the Protect America Act has reduced our ability to conduct surveillance. That is false, and Republicans know it. They know that the Protect America Act gave the intelligence community authorization for one full year, meaning that they are all still in effect until August of this year. 
   If Republicans really believed that the expiration of the act would jeopardize our national security, why did every single Republican Member of this body vote against a 21-day extension of the act last month? 
   Washington Republicans can't have it both ways. Rather than resorting to political games, congressional Republicans should have joined bicameral negotiations that were conducted for several weeks to develop a strong compromise bill. It is time that the Republicans get off the sidelines and work with our Congress. Let's see this legislation come to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget. 
   As Chair of the Hispanic Task Force on Health and the Environment, this budget speaks to the growing need to create green collar jobs and reinvest in our country, and I am very proud that they were able to include that language in this proposed budget. 
   It also increases Federal spending for unemployment insurance and food stamps. And we know that Latinos are hard-pressed and hard hit when it comes to bad economic times in this country, and we are no different. Right now in my district in East Los Angeles, we see upwards of 7.2 percent of unemployment and foreclosures occurring almost every hour. In my district alone, 650,000 people have already lost their home. It's time for a change. It's time for a new direction. 
   This budget also increases Federal spending on Federal Medicaid assistance percentage payments to our States, which are sorely in need of that assistance right now, providing help, again, for foreclosures and housing assistance; reinvesting and creating jobs  in the near term repairing the Nation's schools, transportation, and infrastructure. 
   I also want to touch base on something that's very deeply of much concern with our community, and that is with respect to education and health care overall. And I'll tell you the temperature of the patient in terms of Latinos, African Americans, and people of color is not good. Right now what we see is 40 million people that don't have health care insurance. About 40 percent of those happen to be Latino children under the age of 6. We know there has to be a change. We need to promote a budget that will provide that kind of safety net for all Americans. 
   Our budget also increases veterans funding in 2009 by $3.6 billion, something that we should keep as an honorable deed when we say that we want to send our soldiers out there to defend, first and foremost, our liberties. Let's make sure that we take care of them when they come home. A high percentage tend to be those young men and women of color using the military because they have no other way of gaining access. When they come home, whether they are disabled or not, they need to have the kind of assistance that's ready made available for them where they don't have to trek 2 hours to get on a bus to go down to the nearest Veterans Administration to get help and assistance. We need to change that and this budget does that. 
   In terms of the environment and global warming, Latinos' low-income communities are always hard-pressed. We need to reverse that trend and make sure that EPA gets the full assistance that they need to enforce our current laws that will create a better level playing field for all Americans.     
   This budget addresses that issue. 
   Again, I would like to say that I am strongly supportive of the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget and would ask the Members of the House to support this budget in a new direction and new reform for this country.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (ADDRESSING THE MURDERS OF WOMEN IN CIUDAD JUAREZ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss recent efforts to address the ongoing murders of the women of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, located just 5 minutes from our border near El Paso. 
   Over the past 14 years, well over 400 women, and I mean young women and girls, have been slaughtered, brutally murdered or raped in the city of Ciudad Juarez. I hold up this poster here tonight to show you the list of over 400 names of young women whose bodies have either not been found or identified, but we know have been missing, many who were those victims that were found slaughtered in the streets of Mexico. These are the names of young women who were taken from their families too soon. In fact, the profile of many of these young girls is within the age range of 15 to 20. 
   Slender with long black hair, olive skin, many working in the heart of Ciudad Juarez in what we call maquiladoras. Those are American-run corporations where many of these women were forced to work to help provide for their families. 
   The fact remains that many of these murders still remain unsolved. Many of these women were put on a track to work four different shifts. Given if you have a young woman or child working on a shift from 12 midnight to 8 in the morning, how was she transported there? Were there any security protections put in place to protect her? Was law enforcement aware and knowingly, maybe somehow acknowledged that these murders were taking place but did nothing? 
   That is why we are crying out today, along with the families of Ciudad Juarez and along with those families I represent in my own district. I was reminded that there are some relatives who were murdered. In fact, one young man whose cousin was missing went to Mexico to find out what happened. When he began inquiring about that particular case, the police there informed him that he should stay away and not ask questions and inquire about his cousin. Well, he didn't just leave it there. He kept insisting on finding out what the facts were and why this death was not given the full extent and force of the law. Evidently, at that point the police said, if you do not stay away, you will be the one that will end up in jail. And sure enough, that is what happened. 
   It is unfortunate that laws there are not given the same kind of credibility that we have here in the U.S. I cry out here with my friends and families because we are saying that the U.S.-Mexican Government has to do something. 
   After the recent election of President Calderon, he states that he is going to do everything he can in his power to provide enforcement of laws that protect women against violence, yet we still have not seen enough done where we find the culprits who have been involved in these vicious murders over the last few years. Given he has just recently been elected and has spoken about bringing his office behind the enforcement of violence against women, he has even helped to try to enact legislation to do that, but every single state in Mexico has to adopt those provisions and those codes. What I am finding is that many of those states in Mexico are not following along that line. 
   I have to ask myself, when we can help women in Iraq and Afghanistan who have been murdered by the Taliban, why can we not ask for the same kind of respect and dignity from our partners in the south, from Mexico. I know this is not a partisan issue. Here in the House we were able to send a letter to President Calderon. In fact, 90 Members of the House signed onto the letter, and I thank the subcommittee Chair, Mr. Engel, of the Foreign Affairs Committee on this particular area, and also DAN BURTON, for being so gracious and helping to support this resolution passed by this House, H. Con. Res. 90, and also a letter that we recently sent to President Calderon. 
   I ask that the House speak up about this issue because this continues to go on. In fact, I was pleased we had a delegation go down 2 years ago to visit alongside the border and meet with the families and meet with public officials and ask why there was nothing being done to help expedite these cases. In fact, our government went as far as to even provide assistance through USAID to have forensic experts come in to help identify the cadavers of these young women. I believe there are 79, maybe more now, cadavers that have not been identified. 
   Families have contacted me and other Members of Congress asking for help on our side because we have the tools and instruments to do that. I know this country has the goodwill and can do some things, but I am also pleading to those parliamentarians and to the President of Mexico to do the same thing. While he is asking for us to help in immigration reform, which I am strongly supportive of, I also ask him to do what he can to help with law enforcement, with reform, and also to help expedite those cases that still have to be processed, and would ask that our Congress also support the continuance of oversight on this particular issue for the women and families of Ciudad Juarez.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss the need to make access to health insurance for everyone a priority in our country. 
   As you know, 46 million Americans are uninsured, including more than 9 million children in the U.S. One in three people in the San Gabriel Valley, which I represent, is uninsured; and across the State of California, 6.5 million adults and 750,000 children lack health care insurance. Nationwide, 83 percent of the uninsured are from working families. Of uninsured Californians, more than two-thirds of those families have full-time jobs. Fourteen million uninsured are Latinos, including one in five children. 
   In the past 5 years, the number of Latinos without health insurance, as you know, has increased. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, uninsured children are five times less likely to have visited a doctor or dentist in the past 2 years compared to those children who are insured. Fewer doctor visits can lead to serious illness and health problems, as well as avoidable costly emergency room visits. The Institute of Medicine estimates that each year at least 18,000 people die prematurely due to lack of health insurance. 
   But President Bush's proposal will not help the 46 million uninsured men, women, and children in our country. Instead of finding real solutions, President Bush wants to provide tax deductions to wealthy Americans who can already afford their health care insurance. Tax deductions, as you know, will not solve the real problem of skyrocketing health care costs. Tax deductions will not make it easier for low-income families and middle-class working families to purchase health care insurance. In fact, as you know, our families may be better off without the President's so-called help. 
   According to Families USA, President Bush's plan is ``like throwing a 50-foot rope to someone in a 40-foot hole.'' And for the majority of uninsured people, his plan is like throwing them nothing at all. 
   People without employer-sponsored coverage, such as people who work in small businesses, who make up the majority of those individuals in some of our districts, will not benefit from Bush's tax breaks. Even White House officials admit that only 3 to 5 million uninsured people would actually become insured under Bush's proposal. The President's plan, as you know, fails to relieve the problems that most uninsured adults and children face. 
   We have to do better for the American people. And we must ensure that everyone has access to affordable and quality health care insurance and that programs are easily accessible by all. Programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance Programs, as you know, are very important. We call them the SCHIP program, and in the State of California they are known as the Healthy Families Program. Across the Nation, Medicaid and SCHIP provide coverage for more than 34 million children. These programs must be adequately funded and include needed tools to reach all eligible populations. 
   However, as you know, millions more children are eligible for these programs but are not enrolled. In fact, 74 percent of the uninsured children are eligible but are not somehow showing up on these enrollment applications. Many are low income. They come from families that are poor and unaware of the fact that they are eligible even for these services. And recent research shows that the SCHIP program may be failing to reach the hardest to reach subpopulations of the uninsured children like Latinos. And according to Families USA, distrust of the health care system, language, culture, these are all barriers that are confusing to our families, and those eligibility rules are high obstacles for families to enroll. 
   Community health care workers, such as the promotoras, play key roles in overcoming these barriers to enrollment for public programs. Promotoras, as you know, exist in the State of California and along the frontera, along the border on the U.S. side. They are qualified people who could help patients access and navigate the complex and confusing health care system. They can reach racial and ethnic minorities that would otherwise remain locked out of our system. 
   A recent report by the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics compared the effectiveness of community workers with traditional Medicaid and SCHIP outreach enrollment. The report found that families who interacted with community health workers such as the promotoras were eight times more likely to obtain health insurance.     
   Almost 96 percent of children who work with promotoras in the study obtained health insurance. Seventy-eight percent were insured continuously. The study provides that community health workers can reduce the number of uninsured children, and we should move forward asking for the SCHIP program to also provide for assistance through the promotoras program. 
   I know that the gentlewoman from California understands what I am talking about, because those promotoras also exist in her district as well. 
   We need to make sure that President Bush plans for a significant funds for those children that are uninsured, and I would ask that our colleagues please continue to provide funding for the SCHIP program and to expand that in those needed areas.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (STATE OF THE UNION -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Last November, the American people demanded a dramatic change at home and abroad. Now in the majority, Democrats in Congress are delivering on that promise. With the State of the Union address to be held tonight, President Bush can demonstrate that he has listened to the American public and is ready to work with the Congress on these priorities. On critical issues from Iraq to energy independence, it is time to take America in a new direction. 
   On security and Iraq. President Bush likes to make promises in the State of the Union addresses, he just doesn't always keep those promises. The President has promised the American people to strengthen America's security. Unfortunately, his policies have made the world more dangerous and America less safe. Now he wants to escalate the war in Iraq over the overwhelming opposition of the American public and many of his own generals. Unfortunately, President Bush's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will not bring success in Iraq or make America safer. It will receive an up-or-down vote in both chambers of Congress. We will always put our troops first, and that means holding the President accountable for those changes that he wants to provide. 
   Democrats have a plan for success that will make America safer and bring our troops home. Shifting the principal mission of our forces from combat to training, logistics, force protection and activities to counter terrorism; beginning the phased deployment of our forces in the income tax 4 to 6 months; and implementing an aggressive diplomatic strategy both within the region and beyond to help the Iraqis achieve a sustainable political settlement, including amending their constitution. 
   On economic security. Last November, the American people demanded real results to improve their everyday lives and strengthen middle-class families. Today, President Bush has the opportunity to talk about a change of action there and work in a bipartisan way with those of us that are here serving in the House. 
   In its first 100 hours, the House of Representatives succeeded in passing legislation to raise the minimum wage, expand Federal funding for stem cell research, implement recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, require negotiations for lower prescription drug costs, make college more affordable for many, many families, and end subsidies for Big Oil to invest in clean renewable energy. These 100-hour bills are just the beginning. The new Congress will do more to take America in a new direction. 
   On health care. President Bush's health insurance proposal is a tax hike on the middle class of our country. It will do little to help the uninsured and will undermine the health insurance of those lucky enough to have it already. In the same year that President Bush is once again submitting a budget making his tax cuts permanent--tax cuts that go overwhelmingly to the richest Americans--he is proposing to shift more of the cost of health care onto working families. Under President Bush's leadership, the Nation's health insurance crisis has actually worsened, costs are up and the number of uninsured Americans has grown. This latest proposal is another step in the wrong direction. 
   On energy independence. Key to our national security and our economic security is energy independence. Last year in the State of the Union address by the President, he declared that we were addicted to oil. One week later in his annual budget, he shortchanged the development of alternative fuels and technologies needed to make America energy independent. As you know, Democrats are already putting America on a path to energy independence by cutting huge subsidies to Big Oil and investing in the alternative fuels and technologies needed to protect our national security, our economy and our environment. The science of global warming and its impact is overwhelming, as you know. The American public understands the urgency of the problem. We want to work with President Bush in a bipartisan fashion but we can't wait for him to put science before special interests. 
   Democrats will listen to what President Bush has to say today and we hope he will listen to the American public. It is time for all of us to work together for a new direction for all Americans.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me the opportunity to speak this afternoon. 
   I strongly support the rule. I strongly support our men and women in uniform who are courageously fighting to defend our freedoms. In my own district, we lost 14 soldiers. My recent trip to Iraq confirmed that to support our troops is to support their redeployment. Our troops told me they were overextended and underequipped. Many are on their second, third and fourth tour. They face increased risk without proper equipment and longer stays. In fact, not enough equipment was available for those new incoming soldiers that were just deployed by this President. That is what I heard from our troops when I visited there about a month ago. 
   Extending the tours of all active-duty personnel is unacceptable, a price our families shouldn't have to pay, nor our troops. As Members of Congress, we have the responsibility to protect and  provide for the best interests of all of our troops. That includes the redeployment out of Iraq and a safe return home. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and vote for these bills to support our troops. 
   One last comment. I want to thank the Speaker of this House for having the courage to allow us to vote on these very important pieces of legislation this day. It is indeed a historic day.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, it's no surprise that our Nation's economy is struggling. The cities in the 32nd Congressional District that I represent have seen unemployment rates soar to 7.2 percent. Gasoline prices continue to go up above $3. 
   In Los Angeles, a family loses a home to foreclosure every hour. 
   However, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors seem to be booming. 
   In 2006, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors generated 8.5 million jobs, nearly $1 trillion in revenue for the United States. These jobs are good-paying jobs, and they will not be outsourced. 
   The Green Collar Job Act that was signed into law recently will help train 3 million new workers. Through the program, workers included will be those in underserved communities like mine. 
   In this time of economic turmoil, we need to invest in America and in our workforce. Let's make sure that Congress appropriates the accorded amount of money so that we can create this stream of jobs that will stay here on our shores.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the millions of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage. I would like to thank my good friend, Congressman Mike Honda, for leading the special orders tonight on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and providing us with this opportunity to speak to you tonight. 
   I represent a heavily, heavily populated Asia Pacific community in southern California, I think the second most populated in the country. The first group that makes up a large proportion is Taiwanese and Chinese. The second group is Filipino. I am very proud to have represented them for so many years. 
   But I am here tonight to pay tribute to the many of them who provide us with public service in government, science, law and business, athletics and in the arts. These communities that I represent are the cities of Monterey Park, Rosemead, West Covina and the San Gabriel Valley. Well over 120,000 individuals represent that district. 
   They are Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and of Cambodian decent. As you know, they work hard, like many immigrants that come to this country. Nearly 30 percent of the minority-owned businesses are owned by Asian Pacific Islanders and African-American women. In recent years, a number of Asian and Pacific Islander women-owned businesses has increased by 69 percent in the district. 
   According to the Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Americans own at least two-thirds of Monterey Park's more than 5,000 businesses. I have long been a supporter of a program called PACE, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, which was founded back in 1976 to address the employment and job training needs of Asian Pacific Islanders. Believe it or not, there are many Asian Pacific Islanders who really do need the support of the Federal Government and our various forms of government to help them succeed in our country. 
   Today it provides workforce development, housing services, business assistance and early childhood education in Los Angeles county. I would especially like to recognize a good friend of mine, Kerry Doi, with whom I have worked for a number of years, whom I am extremely proud of. Earlier this year, his program, known as PACE, and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity Women and Company, chose 10 prominent small business owners to give $1,000 checks to. 
   You may think that's not a lot of money, but for first-time business owners of Asian Pacific descent, it meant a lot. I am proud of the work they are doing to help all small business owners, including those of API heritage, to succeed. 
   I have also worked closely with the East San Gabriel Valley Japanese Community Center and the Monterey Park Langley Senior Center, predominantly of Asian descent. I am proud to have these organizations in my district because they are wonderful places where individuals from this community can gather and have social time, artistic time, recreational time and share their culture with each other. 
   At the senior center, I meet often with them. They take language courses, computer classes and different exercise courses that help them to keep busy in our community. Many of the seniors and their families and others have been touched by the immigration process recently. 
   In fact, I would say that the second largest case load in my district happened to be individuals of API descent. They, just as much as anyone else, want to become naturalized citizens, and they are stepping up to the plate. I was happy to host a citizenship forum that we held in the City of Irwindale recently, and I would say about 200 or more families of API descent came forward to become naturalized citizens. I am proud that is happening in our community and across the country. 
   I am here to support, again, the efforts of the API caucus, which Mike Honda leads, and to work with my colleagues there on the tri-caucus to help put forward disparities and treatment in health care issues regarding API, the Hispanic community and the African-American community. We are working together to bridge our gaps so that we can provide better services to all Americans in all residents of our country. I am happy and pleased to be able to put this forward tonight in support of the API caucus.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (CESAR ESTRADA CHAVEZ STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 359, the Cesar Chavez Study Act, and urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know that the National Park System units are important components of our Nation's historic, cultural and economic and recreation and social identity. 
   H.R. 359 authorizes a study to determine whether sufficient historic resources still exist, so that the story of Cesar Chavez could be added to the National Park System. 
   I first introduced this legislation more than 6 years ago to honor the important contributions he made to the environment and to help the National Park Service finally recognize a significant Hispanic leader. Since then, I have worked hard with my colleagues to bring this bill to the floor. 
   I would like to personally thank Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their support, and the staff of the committee. 
   Cesar Estrada Chavez was a second-generation American. He was born in the United States March 31, 1927 in Yuma, Arizona, and raised during the Great Depression. 
   The lessons he learned during his time inspired him to dedicate his life to improving the lives of others less fortunate even than himself. 
   Chavez led by action. He was a student of Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy, and believed that non-violence was one of the most powerful tools to achieve change, including social and economic justice and equality. 
   In 1968 he fasted for 25 days, Mr. Speaker, one of many fasts he held to demonstrate a commitment to non-violence through sacrifice and penance. He was a deeply religious man. 
   Through his work, Cesar Chavez changed the course of history for thousands of Latinos and Hispanics and farm workers in this country. Farm workers have been empowered now to fight for fair wages, health care coverage, pension benefits, housing improvements, pesticide and health regulations and countless other protections for their health and well-being. 
   These changes have meant considerably improvements for the life of farm workers and their families, in fact, three fourths of which are Hispanic or Latino. 
   During his 66 years with us, Chavez made a significant difference in the lives of those he touched, well beyond improvements for farm workers. And at an early age, I too was inspired by Cesar Chavez's work on behalf of farm workers and the environmental justice movement. This includes protecting green space in both urban and rural areas so that all communities can enjoy the benefits of recreation. 
   Chavez strongly understood the importance of land and the value of the environment in connection to one's health and economic stability. For many Hispanics, this appreciation of the environment is cultural; 96 percent of Hispanics believe that the environment should be an important priority for this country, yet there is not one single unit of the National Park System dedicated to Hispanics. 
   And as a result of Chavez's belief exhibited through his actions, I was moved to introduce this legislation and believe it important that we preserve the history through our National Park System. It is my hope that one day Hispanic families all have a place in the National Park Service where they can appreciate, honor and learn about Cesar Chavez's work, his beliefs, just as we do now in celebration with African American families who can now visit the Martin Luther King, Jr. historical site and Selma-Montgomery trail. 
   The significance of Chavez's life and work is widely recognized. The Department of Labor has honored Chavez in the Labor Hall of Fame, and the Bush administration, as you heard, supports this legislation. I won't list all the supporters, but there are more than 20 organizations nationally recognized who support this legislation. 
   In fact, at his funeral, Cardinal Roger Mahoney of Los Angeles called Chavez, and I quote, ``a special prophet for the world's farm workers.'' 
   In 1994, Chavez's widow, Helen, accepted the Medal of Freedom from President Clinton, who lauded Chavez for facing a ``formidable, often violent opposition with dignity and non-violence.'' 
   It is my hope that through this legislation, future generations can understand who Cesar Chavez was, and why the work that he did was so important, know that they too can be courageous and work toward the betterment of all mankind. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3963, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me. And I ask my colleagues to please rise with us today on behalf of the many, many children, 10 million children, that will benefit from the reauthorization and on this rule so that we can hear the discussion and the debate on the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   We can't afford not to help those 10 million children. These families here will be the ones that benefit, and future generations, Americans, citizens, will benefit. The SCHIP Reauthorization Act will help reduce what we call health care disparities that currently exist in our communities and in this country. 
   And although programs such as SCHIP and Medicaid have decreased the number of uninsured children over the last few years, there still has been a lack of funding and outreach efforts that have left millions of eligible children just like these without any form of health care coverage. In fact, 70 percent of Latino children are eligible for health care coverage through public programs, but remain uninsured. 
   This bill that we are going to debate will reduce the number of uninsured children of color by supporting community health care workers who are better known to give advice to many in our community. These are people that they can trust. These are people that can help inform them on how to go through the process of receiving this type of aid and assistance through the SCHIP program.  
   While we're doing that, we're going to reach millions of people who have otherwise not been enrolled in the program, particularly those communities that speak other languages, not just bilingual, but also people from different ethnic background like Armenians, Russians, Pacific Islanders and, yes, of course, Latinos.     
   The compromise legislation, as I see it, before us today is a step in the right direction, and we have an opportunity and a moral obligation to do what is right for our children and our families. These are the most vulnerable communities in the United States. Children of all ages and of all communities of color are counting on us to do the right thing. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this rule for the sake of the 10 million children and their families that will benefit from the increase in funding for health care coverage for the most vulnerable populations in our society.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to join us in bringing down the price of gasoline and securing our energy supply. 
   Last December we enacted legislation that began to redirect our Nation's energy policy so it is clean, secure, and invests in our workforce. 
   In May we passed the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008, legislation which gives the U.S. authorities the ability to prosecute those who engage in anti-competitive behavior, like the cartels such as OPEC. 
   Just last month we also passed the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which will provide needed investments and security to renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. 
   With the passage of all these bills and others, we are reducing our dependence on oil to bring down the record gas prices, secure our Nation's energy supply, and create hundreds of thousands of green collar jobs. 
   I urge my colleagues to help our businesses and consumers and struggling families to support all of these efforts.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 70,000 eligible Medicare beneficiaries in the 32nd Congressional District of California, I rise to strongly support this legislation to reduce the cost of prescription drugs through negotiated pricing. 
   As a result of the Medicare Modernization Act, millions of low-income and minority seniors pay higher prices for their prescriptions. A recent report by Families USA revealed that the lowest Medicare part D plan drugs are still 58 percent higher than the lowest prices offered by those with the authority to negotiate, like the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Negotiated pricing is the difference between receiving needed medicine and putting food on the table. This is a reality for one in five Latinos above the age of 65 who live in poverty. Latinos are the fastest growing sector of the senior population. As chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Health, I am concerned that without negotiated drug prices, Latino seniors will be unable to afford their medication and continue to suffer needlessly from chronic health diseases. 
   The overwhelming majority of Americans favor allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices for the Medicare program. 
   Organizations such as the National Council of La Raza, the Nation's largest Hispanic civil rights organization, and the National Hispanic Medical Association, which represents licensed Hispanic physicians in the U.S., support this legislation because they agree it will make a difference in the lives of Latino seniors. 
   I am proud that today we are considering this legislation that will make a real difference to the health and welfare of all of our seniors. 
   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will help to make prescription drugs affordable for all of our constituents for seniors across the country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4.

   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and also the underlying bill, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. We can't afford to spend $10 billion a month on this failed war and continue to see the loss of lives, 3,600 now. From my district alone, 14 individuals have not come home to see their families. 27,000 have come home injured from the war. 
   I want to tell you that in March I had the opportunity to visit some of our troops in Iraq, many from California representing southern California's San Gabriel Valley. Many of them told me they did not have appropriate equipment, that they were there for an insurmountable time, many on their second, third and fourth tour. One family member from the City of Azusa told me that he had not even seen his child. It had been already 14 months. 
   I would ask Members of Congress to remember who our constituents are. I have the adjoining district next to Congressman Dreier. In my district alone, 4-1 in a survey said, Republican and Democrat, we want the Congress to get us out of the war. 
   I ask for support of our bill and the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SOLIS. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MINORITIES IN THE MEDIA -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the contributions of minorities in the media and encourage greater media diversity. 
   The past year marked a breakthrough for Latinos in the media. Just last night, America Ferrera won the Emmy award for best actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's ``Ugly Betty.'' In her portrayal of Betty Suarez in ``Ugly Betty,'' Ms. Ferrera portrays an intelligent, caring young Latina professional trying to break into the field of publishing. Her character has a strong connection to her family, while at the same time she is dedicated to her work. 
   America Ferrera is the daughter of Honduran immigrants. Through her work on ``Ugly Betty'' and in films, including ``Real Women Have Curves,'' she is a role model for many young Latinas and women of color everywhere. 
   We need to improve the image of American Latinos and Latinas as portrayed by the media. We can do this by increasing the number of American Latinos employed in all facets of the media industry. 
   ``Ugly Betty'' is one of the few programs on broadcast television that portrays a Latino family and main characters. The show has waded into tough issues like immigration by portraying the struggle of Betty's father to successfully navigate the immigration process. 
   In describing her Emmy last night, America Ferrera said the win, ``Symbolizes the wonderful blessings of the past year. I am so happy and humble to be on a show that is not only fun, but is making a difference and inspiring people and changing the way we look at prejudice and diversity.'' 
   Other Latinos also have important roles to play as well in the media. Characters such as Dr. Callie Torres, portrayed by Sara Ramirez on ``Grey's Anatomy,'' and Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria on ``Desperate Housewives,'' portray dynamic Latinas in television. 
   Behind the scenes, Selma Hayek, a premier actress herself, is also producer of the ``Ugly Betty'' show. Another new program called ``Cane,'' featuring a Latino family in Florida involved in the sugar business, is premiering this fall on CBS. 
   This is important because the characters that Americans see on television can help shape their view of the world and attitudes toward different groups of different backgrounds. In fact, 40 percent of American youth ages 19 and under are children of color, and very few of those faces that we see on television actually represent the races and cultural heritage here in America. 
   With increasing positive portrayals of minorities and programs, television can reflect a broader majority of hardworking American families, families that are indeed diverse. We should not stifle diversity of voices in the news and entertainment that consumers see, hear and read. The success of programs like ``Ugly Betty'' and the recognition of actresses like America Ferrera show that the American public is paying attention and wants to see more quality and diverse programming. 
   In this new and exciting time, minority performers and programs are not only increasing, but are also being honored. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the FCC and media companies to promote diversity in the media. 
   Again, I want to congratulate America Ferrera on her Emmy win and commend America and everyone on the cast of ``Ugly Betty'' for breaking down those stereotypes of Latinas. I hope that this is one of the first in a long line of successes for minority performers and that programs that retain positive minority characters will flourish. Working together, we can provide diversity, promote it, and have a better understanding here in our country.
