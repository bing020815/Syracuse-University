   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Chairman Waters, I want to salute you and the work you've done in the housing area in Financial Services. Everybody knows that the Housing Subcommittee under your leadership has focused on issues important to everyday people, and I want to thank you for that leadership. 
   And, Madam Chairman, you know what is the most amazing thing when I sit on the floor of this House? All the superfluous stuff that is discussed when a piece of legislation that's sorely needed by the people of America comes to the floor. 
   Now it was a Republican administration for the past 8 years that has oversight on oil. If they wanted to do something about it, they could have done it by now. Why are they bringing it up on the housing legislation? Let's talk about oversight of all those billions of dollars that got lost in that truck in Iraq. This Republican administration. 
   But before I get lost, let me come to why I'm standing here. I stand here to  support the legislation because the city of Cleveland is in desperate straits around this particular problem: Housing and foreclosures. I am so pleased that I have been able to add an amendment that would simplify the Federal historic rehabilitation tax credit in the process of this so that we can use some of this historic housing to be able to make some changes in the lives of the people. 
   It's just an amazing thing. I know the people of America are out there listening, and they're looking at who is it that is stepping up for them when they're in trouble? Who is it that understands that they need to pay their homeowner costs, their costs for their housing? And who is it to say, no, we're going to wait to try to figure out something else, add a new law. Come on now. 
   Vote for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, restoring passenger rail service to one of the most densely-populated urban corridors in Ohio--Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati--is an idea beyond overdue at the station. This corridor is at the heart of a potentially vibrant passenger rail system in Ohio, a fact borne out by a number of studies dating back as far as the 1980's. 
   Public demand is growing for transportation choices in Ohio. Significant anecdotal evidence around the United States suggests that even basic passenger rail service such as this would draw heavy ridership and grow the demand for more service. 
   Today, the reality of ever-higher gasoline prices and their impact on the everyday mobility of our fellow Ohioans and on Ohio's economy makes the restoration of rail passenger service in Ohio a critical transportation need. 
   We are hearing from our constituents increasingly that ``pain at the pump'' leaves them few or only expensive options to travel on business, and to access everything from education to jobs to medical care. 
   Since January of 2007 alone, the average price of unleaded gas in Cleveland has gone up 72 percent. In some cases, Ohioans are seeing more and more of their incomes going to feed their car and cutting into other life necessities. 
   A recent study by the Ohio Rail Association discussed the economic impact that high-speed rail would have on Ohio and the surrounding region. Here are just a few of the benefits of high-speed rail in Ohio: A seven corridor high-speed rail system in Ohio would save $9.4 million in fuel per year; there would be approximately 1.1 million annual riders just out of Cleveland alone by 2025; and it would provide 16,700 permanent jobs as well as 6,100 temporary jobs to build the rail system. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of this bill to move Amtrak forward with high-speed rail.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTEGRATION OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 60th year of an integrated United States military. On July 26, 1948, President Harry S Truman signed Executive Order 9981. Since that date, people of color have been able to serve honorably in our Armed Forces. 
   As I reflect upon that day and the significance that it holds, I wonder how it was received in my district. I can imagine the pride and optimism that my parents felt as they picked up their copy of the Cleveland Plain Dealer on July 27, 1948, and read the headline ``Segregation Hit in Truman Orders.'' As the civil rights movement was beginning to gain momentum, the Democratic Party of the North began to break away from their Southern affiliates. As the article indicates, President Truman grew tired of waiting for Congress to act on his civil rights legislation. So through an executive order, he recognized the injustice that had been done to millions of Americans and unilaterally opened the door for them to participate in civil service. 
   While the Civil Rights Movement is not over, we have seen and continue to see progress in our society's treatment of minorities. Even before President Truman used his pen to integrate the Federal Government, minorities were loyally serving our Nation. I am still in awe when I think of how men of color fought in the Civil War, how they participated in our westward expansion, the Great War, World War II, and even Korea, all without the respect of being treated as an equal at home. The passion shared by minority communities for the principles our Nation undoubtedly motivated millions of individuals to fight the good fight and work for a better tomorrow. 
   As we celebrate 60 years of an integrated military, my colleagues and I in the House of Representatives are preparing to celebrate the career of LTC Joselyn Lloyd Bell, Jr. Lieutenant Colonel Bell will be retiring from the United States Army on July 25th after 20 years of distinguished service. An outstanding African-American officer, Lieutenant Colonel Bell represents all that minority men and women in uniform dreamed of experiencing prior to EO 9981. 
   After being commissioned through the Recruit Officer Training Corps at the University of Central Arkansas, Second Lieutenant Bell became a military intelligence officer. His service at the tactical and operational levels provided him with the ability to demonstrate his strong leadership and professional skills. Eventually, he would apply his expertise and help prepare the Army for the future by commanding units which tested several of the platforms currently in use today. Lieutenant Colonel Bell's last assignment prior to retirement was with the Office of Army Legislative Liaison. Through this role, he was able to advocate for a stronger Army and share his experience with my colleagues. 
   One day following the publication of EO 9981, President Truman addressed Congress in a special session. In his speech he addressed a slowing economy, housing issues and the ability of Americans to find suitable employment. I find it interesting that now, almost 60 years later, my colleagues and I are discussing the same issues. Today we monitor the price of oil, we work vigorously to address the housing foreclosure issue and to keep jobs here in America. While our military is integrated we have yet to reach our full potential.  The racial composition of our enlisted and officer corps does not reflect the progress that we have achieved. Out of the 899 flag officers, only 27 are African-American. The statistics concerning women, Latinos, Asian-Americans, American Indian and Alaskan Natives are equally disappointing. In 2003, several key individuals within the military community filed an amicus brief to reiterate that the strength of our military rests firmly upon the diversity within it. 
   As we thank Lieutenant Colonel Bell for his service and his family for their support, we may again turn to the words of President Truman. As the President closed his address to Congress on July 27th, 1948, he stated, ``The vigor of our democracy is judged by its ability to take decisive actions--actions which are necessary to maintain our physical and moral strength and to raise our standards of living. In these days of continued stress, the test of that vigor becomes more and more difficult .....'' As our global community is challenged by the threat of non-state actors, our Armed Forces continue to be involved in two major conflicts, and our communities progress towards complete integration, I feel that we in the Congress have it within us to honor those that have served and those who are serving. We must continue to work with our men and women in uniform to provide all Americans with the opportunity to succeed.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CAMPUS FIRE SAFETY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of H. Res. 95, a bipartisan resolution that I, along with Mr. Whitfield, introduced to establish September as Campus Fire Safety Month. 
   This legislation encourages administrators and municipalities across the country to provide educational programs to all students during September and throughout the school year on fire safety. 
   Additionally, the resolution calls for evaluation of the level of fire safety being provided in both on- and off-campus student housing and taking the necessary steps to ensure fire-safe living environments through fire safety education, installation of fire suppression and detection systems and the development and enforcement of applicable codes relating to fire safety. 
   In June, the Senate adopted a similar resolution, sponsored by Senator Joe Biden, that also encourages campus fire safety across the Nation. 
   Nationwide, 113 people have been killed in student housing since January 2000, as identified by the Center for Campus Fire Safety, a nonprofit organization that compiles information on campus-related fires. Almost 80 percent of the fire fatalities have occurred in off-campus occupancies such as rented houses and apartments. Common factors in a number of these fires include: lack of automatic sprinklers, disabled smoke alarms, careless disposal of smoking materials, and alcohol consumption. According to the center, April and May, followed by August and September, are the two most dangerous periods of time for student housing fire fatalities. So far 31 States have issued proclamations declaring September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Historically, September is one of the most fatal months for campus fires, but for the first time since 2000 there were no fatalities last September. 
   H. Res. 95 is supported by the Center for Campus Fire Safety, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Congressional Fire Services Institute, National Fire Protection Association, International Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, National Fire Sprinkler Association, International Code Council, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, International Association of Fire Marshals. 
   For the past few Congresses I have introduced H.R. 642, known as the College Fire and Prevention Act. This legislation would establish a demonstration incentive program within the Department of Education to promote installation of fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or prevention technologies, in qualified student housing or dormitories, and for other purposes. The Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National Fire Sprinkler Association and the American Fire Sprinkler Association have endorsed this fire prevention legislation. 
   Fire safety and prevention is an issue that needs to be addressed across this country. Over these few years we have seen many tragedies involving fire at colleges, places of business, entertainment venues and places of residence. We must begin to put in place suppression measures against fires and increase support and resources for our fire fighters to ensure that no more lives are lost to fires that could have been prevented. I am pleased to say that this institution adopted this resolution in the 109th Congress and will do so again today. It is encouraging that we remain committed to bringing awareness to this issue in order to prevent more needless deaths of our students. 
   I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation so that we can increase awareness about this problem that affects us all.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, here we are, June 2008. How many people do you know are unemployed? How many people do you know who have been walking, looking for a job, need an opportunity, can't figure out how they're going to pay for gas that costs $4 a gallon, milk that costs $3.50, a loaf of bread that costs $3? How many people do you know like that? 
   Why not extend unemployment? Why not give these folks an opportunity? They were hardworking people. They were part of the working class of America, and now are locked out and left out of the process. 
   In my own congressional district, there is a community where the unemployment rate is 11 percent. They want to go back to work. What a boom to the economy. Give some unemployment benefits to some folks, let them go spend some money and take care of their families. If only the Congress would do that today, what a significant opportunity we would have to bring some people out of a morass back into an opportunity to do well. 
   Pass this legislation, ladies and gentlemen. It's the right thing to do.  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY for their diligent work to bring this legislation to the Floor. Additionally I would like to thank the Chair of the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, JIM MCDERMOTT and Ranking Member WELLER for their leadership on this issue. 
   In our teetering economy it is often the unemployed who suffer the most, and it is time that Congress take a stand for our Nation's unemployed. The unemployment rate surged to 5.5 percent from 5.0 percent--the biggest one-month jump in more than two decades (since February 1986) and climbing to the highest level in nearly four years (October 2004). 
   These are American workers in the most vulnerable position--often not able to put food on the table for their families on a consistent basis. And I will state as I did before we completed the first stimulus package, that we must not forgot those who are not able to find work. 
   My State of Ohio does not meet the test under the current formula for an extension of unemployment benefits. But there are various parts of Ohio, including my hometown of Cleveland which may by definition have over 6 percent unemployment. In Ohio, the unemployment rate has gone from 4.5 percent to 5.3 percent during the Bush Administration. In Cuyahoga County, unemployment is currently at 6.4 percent. Sadly, there are cities within my districts whose numbers are even higher than that. Mere technicalities mean nothing when you cannot pay rent. 
   This condition is prevalent in many areas around the country. Many of these workers have been displaced by the sweeping tide of globalization and are having a hard time finding new employment, or training to transition to a different type of job in our new economy. Mr. Speaker we must not forget these Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise in proud recognition of the 45th Anniversary of Senator John Glenn's mission piloting the first manned orbital mission of the United States. This event spawned decades of manned space missions for the United States and eventually a manned mission to the moon with the Apollo 11 mission in July of 1969. Senator Glenn has served this Nation proud as a Marine Corps Pilot, a U.S. Senator, and an Astronaut. He was the third American in Space and the first American to orbit the Earth aboard Friendship 7. He also holds the honor of being the oldest person ever to go into space in 1998 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery mission STS-95 at age 77. John Glenn was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974, and served the State of Ohio proudly until 1999, and was a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. The NASA Glenn research center, which is located at Lewis Field in Cleveland, OH, adopted Senator Glenn's name in 1999. I am proud to say that this institution has produced decades of aeronautics research and has become of vital part of our community. It is in no small part to Senator Glenn that this institution will remain a major research center for NASA. 
   I am especially proud to be able to say that Senator John Glenn comes from my home State of Ohio, he is an icon and a role model for millions of youths in our State. His accomplishments provide inspiration for every young person from our Great State of Ohio.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 6.  
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6, which works to stop global warming by creating a fund that will support research in renewable energy sources and encourage energy efficiency. 
   Yesterday, the publishers of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a group of prominent experts including physicist Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University, said we are perilously close to destroying the stability of our planet by ignoring the threat of climate change. 
   Carbon dioxide levels are 27 percent higher now than at any point in 650,000 years, and 2006 registered as the warmest year in recorded history. We can no longer afford to postpone action. 
   Our need to act now is further enhanced by our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. Currently, we import 60 percent of our oil, and that number will increase to 75 percent in the next four years. 
   With diminishing domestic oil reserves and growing instability in the Middle East, dependence on imported oil leaves our Nation vulnerable to volatility in foreign nations. 
   Yet we can reverse our course, and H.R. 6 takes a step toward doing so. 
   The CLEAN Act will create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, which will finance legislation that promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   Although 86 percent of America's energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels, a number of alternatives exist that are better for the environment. 
   Ohio is home to the largest wind turbines east of the Rockies, installed near Bowling Green. These utility-scale turbines produce 1.8 Megawatts of electricity. Honda and Iten Industries are currently studying developing wind farms at their facilities in Ashtabula and Logan counties. 
   As part of its Sustainability Program, the City of Cleveland has partnered with Green Energy Ohio to study the feasibility of installing wind turbines on Lake Erie. 
   Ohio is also a leader in biofuels. Most gasoline sold in Ohio contains 10 percent ethanol, and the Ohio Department of Development offers incentives for research in agricultural-based fuels. Ohioans are installing solar panels on their roofs to heat their water, buying hybrid cars to decrease fuel consumption, and building low-impact dams to produce hydro-power. The City of Cleveland is building new bike lanes to encourage commuters to leave their cars at home. 
   Ohioans are committed to using cleaner energy, but doing so is expensive. The reserve  fund established by H.R. 6 would provide the means needed to pursue these environmentally sound strategies. 
   This reserve will be financed by reinvesting money that used to go to large oil companies through tax breaks, allowing Congress to provide this fund without increasing the deficit. 
   Critics of H.R. 6 argue this measure will place an undue burden on oil companies, which will lead to higher gas prices. However, by helping reduce our dependence on oil and diversifying the source of energy for Americans, H.R. 6 will lead to increased long-run fuel price stability. Even President Bush has said, ``Energy companies do not need taxpayer funded incentives to explore for oil and gas.'' 
   Other critics argue the threat of global warming has not been proved. Those in denial ignore the opinions of not only the scientific community, but of corporations such as Wal-Mart and General Electric, state and local governments around the country, and the National Academy of Sciences, who all agree that the fight to stop global warming must start now. 
   H.R. 6 will not single-handedly solve our climate change problems, but it is one part of an elaborate strategy we must undertake in order to ensure that the planet we love will be here for our grandchildren's grandchildren. 
   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the designation of the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building in Indianapolis, IN. 
   Congresswoman Carson was not only a colleague but also a dear friend. It is truly gratifying to me, and surely her family and the constituents of the 7th Congressional District of Indiana, that the House of Representatives would seek to recognize her in this special way. 
   Congresswoman Carson's accomplishments in the House of Representatives are numerous. Most notably, her work to authorize a Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks; sponsorship of an Amtrak reauthorization bill; and passage of language to improve the eligibility requirements for SCHIP, demonstrate her commitment to the needs of underserved people. 
   Her book, My Neighbor as Myself, outlines a vision of how she felt we, as public servants, should serve our community. In this book she discussed the plight of our children and the need for ``powerful parenting'', providing ``responsible relief'' for the poor, job creation, economic empowerment, and community reentry. She was tireless in her efforts to advocate for people who are rarely able to advocate for themselves. 
   Congresswoman Julia Carson will certainly be remembered in the halls of Congress for her character, humor, and unyielding commitment to oppressed and impoverished people. It is my hope that the naming of this post office after such a noble and honorable woman will inspire her story to continue to be told. 
   In years to come, when the children of Indiana ask, ``Who was Julia Carson?'' may they learn the story of a woman who came from the same neighborhood, overcame the same struggles, and pushed for the rights of all in our Nation's capitol. May they learn of a heroine who accomplished great personal success but always remained mindful of who she was here to serve. I pray that the designation of this post office in the name of my dear friend will provide inspiration to those she worked tirelessly for in the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee, the Chair of the housing subcommittee, as well as the ranking members. 
   I used to serve on both of these committees when I was on Financial Services, and my heart longs to address many of the same issues. From the Ways and Means Committee, I hope to try to do some of that. 
   I have traveled to the Hurricane Katrina area on three occasions. The first time I went, I went to visit some of the folks that were put out of their homes and they were staying in arenas across Houston and across Baton Rouge and across New Orleans. 
   The second time I went, I went with Leader Pelosi when a group of us had an opportunity to tour the areas about 9 months later. I sat down and talked with officials. 
   The third time I was there when the people of New Orleans were dying to have an opportunity to vote for the mayoral candidate of their choice. 
   Louisiana is important to me because a lot of my father's and mother's friends lived in Louisiana when they grew up in Alabama. But the thing I think we need to remember about Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, that is America. That is the United States of America, and the people of those communities deserve to be treated royally. They deserve to have the services and housing that they need. I think that this piece of legislation goes towards that effort. 
   More importantly, I have run into people from Louisiana who say, Congresswoman Tubbs Jones, I want to help rebuild New Orleans, but somehow I have to be gone. I want to come back and live, and people are coming from all over the world working in New Orleans rebuilding my hometown. I want to be there to have the opportunity to do that. 
   I believe this legislation gives us an opportunity to do that as well. 
   I have introduced a piece of legislation, H.R. 1043, which is called the Community Restoration and Revitalization Act of 2007. What that legislation does is allows us to use the historic preservation tax credit in conjunction with low-income housing tax credit so that when we rebuild the historic areas of New Orleans, we won't just rebuild for the people who are coming in with money who want to live in those areas, the gentrified areas; but there will be dollars to provide for people who stayed in the community and want to be there for a while and need to be able to afford to live in those areas. 
   This is an important day for us. Just as we rebuilt New York after 9/11 and everybody bought into the process, and I don't make a comparison between 9/11 and a hurricane, but what I will say to you is that the people of this area are Americans just like the rest of us, and they need a place to live, and they need to be able to bring their children back and restore that culture that is so rich a part of the United States of America. 
   I stand here today encouraging, urging, pleading with my colleagues to not let this opportunity pass. Don't let it be said that on March 20, 2007, when your children and grandchildren asked where were you and what did you do for the people of New Orleans, Mississippi and Alabama, and you say, I did nothing. 
   I am glad to stand here in support of the legislation. I celebrate my colleagues and thank you for an opportunity to be heard.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 1st Samuel, chapter 20, verse 18, reads as follows: ``Then Jonathan said to David, tomorrow is the New Moon Festival. You will be missed because your seat will be empty.'' 
   Tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Indiana delegation pause to celebrate the life of a great woman whose seat now stands empty here in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman JULIA CARSON. 
   Congresswoman Carson passed away this past Saturday after a long bout with lung cancer. And while her seat is empty, her spirit lives on in our hearts. She was unique. She often reminded me of the elders in my family. They are  strong in their convictions and don't pull any punches when making their point; yet they have a witty and humorous way about them that can disarm even their most ardent opponent. That was Congresswoman JULIA CARSON. 
   Even though she was in her last illness, she did not let that stop her from advocating on behalf of her constituents. And she never complained. She always greeted you with a warm smile and that unmistakable humor which always made you feel good. 
   She was a trailblazer, born in poverty and racial segregation to a teenage single mother. She came through the political ranks to become the first African American and woman elected to Congress from Indianapolis. A strong advocate for her constituents, she was not afraid to take a stand, be it popular or unpopular. 
   Madam Speaker, I will include for the Record an article that was in today's Roll Call that was written by her predecessor Andy Jacobs as a guest observer and was entitled ``Remembering Congress' Jewel Named Julia.'' It is a wonderful article. I won't go through it because we have a lot of people here who want to speak about their remembrances of our wonderful colleague JULIA CARSON.  
   Remembering Congress' Jewel Named Julia  
   ``Look where he came from and look where he went; and wasn't he a kind of tough struggler all his life right up to the finish?'' The words are those of Carl Sandburg in praise of Abraham Lincoln. The same praise could and should be said of our sister, the late Rep. Julia Carson (D-Ind.), who has passed beyond the sound of our voices into the sunset of her temporal life and into a dawn of history. 
   Where did she come from? Same place as Lincoln--Kentucky. And like him, she was born both to physical poverty and spiritual wealth, and moved to Indiana. 
   Another similarity: Julia also had an ``angel mother,'' Velma Porter, who put a lot of physical, mental and spiritual nutrients into the little flowerpot of her only child. 
   Fast-forward to a month after my first and improbable election to Congress. I was told by mutual friends that at the Chrysler UAW office, I could find a remarkable woman to join me as a co-worker in my Washington Congressional office. Remarkable? Understatement. Thus began my 47-year friendship and, eventually virtual sibling-ship with the already honorable Julia Carson, one of the most intelligent, ethical, industrious and compassionate people I have ever known. 
   Check out her first Congressional brainstorm. It started a national trend. Why make constituents in need of Congressional assistance with bureaucratic problems travel all the way to D.C. to get it? Why not take that part of the office to them? So we adopted her suggestion and did out ``case work'' in Indianapolis with Julia at the helm. It set an example that has been followed by other Congressional offices all over the country ever since. OK, there was one other factor. She had two little kids she preferred to rear in Indianapolis, doing well by her kids by doing good for her country. 
   Later, my refusal to bring home a particularly pernicious piece of political pork earned me a severe gerrymander that, together with the Nixon landslide, ejected me from Congress. Nothing is all bad; the beneficiary of the gerrymander was my much-admired friend, Bill Hudnut (R). That was the year I had to talk Julia into running for the state House of Representatives. She thought it would be disloyal to our friendship because it would take her away from my campaign, which was a campaign of futility that year. 
   She was elected to the state House, where she served with distinction and, in time, she became a state Senator, again gaining friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle. 
   Still later, she became the Center Township trustee and produced real ``welfare reform,'' not with ignorant histrionic speeches and braggadocio, but with hard, quiet and meticulous work. It was reform that broke no poor child's heart, nor sent such a child to bed hungry. She not only ferreted out welfare cheats, but also sued them and got the money back for the taxpayers. Her reform wiped out a long-standing multimillion-dollar debt, moving the then-Marion County Republican auditor to say, ``She wrestled the monster to the ground.'' 
   Julia was unique in that she was the only human being ever to be named Woman of the Year by The Indianapolis Star on two different occasions. 
   It was common parlance to say, ``Congresswoman Carson's people,'' a reference to poor black constituents. Rubbish. The 7th district is about 70 percent nonblack and ``her people'' were all the people of the 7th, regardless of physical or economic description. Millionaires can be treated unjustly by the federal government just as middle- and low-income citizens can. And wherever there was injustice, this Lincoln-like lady was there to redress it. Her political philosophy was a plank from the Sermon on the Mount: ``Blessed are they who thirst for justice.'' 
   There's another one: ``Blessed are the peacemakers.'' She cast our vote against the conspicuously unconstitutional resolution that gave the Cheney gang a fig leaf to order our innocent military to the fraudulent and internationally illegal blood-soaked blunder in Iraq. 
   Julia called me just before she cast that vote and said that, in view of the dishonesty, panic and jingoism of the moment, she expected to lose the next election. ``Courage,'' my mother said, ``is fear that has said its prayers.'' 
   Our Julia, who art in Heaven.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am happy that the Congress is doing its part today to alleviate the pressure Americans all over the country are feeling due to the subprime mortgage crisis. It is estimated that before this housing slump is over, almost 2 million homeowners will lose their homes due to skyrocketing interest rates on their mortgages. 
   In September of this year, the House passed the Mortgage Relief Debt Forgiveness Act of 2007 without controversy. The Members of the House agreed on a bipartisan basis that this relief is necessary to give homeowners peace of mind as they navigate the current difficulties in the housing market. The Senate amendment to this bill further demonstrates Congress's support for this relief. 
   Many Americans are getting hit by the double whammy of, one, losing their homes to foreclosure and, two, getting slapped with a tax bill when the debt on their home is discharged by the lender. In situations where a lender forgives outstanding debt, it is considered income and, thus, is taxable. 
   I believe that our Tax Code, above all, should promote fairness and equity. Under current law, if your House is under foreclosure and the bank discharges your debt, you receive a tax bill. I don't think that's fair or equitable. It doesn't seem right for individuals in this circumstance to face a tax bill when they really have no increase in their net worth. As I see it, their house went down in value, and the individuals couldn't meet their current requirements, resulting in foreclosure. The resolution we consider today rectifies that disconnect so that if a person's principal residence lost value, that loss won't give rise to a tax liability. The provision would sunset in 3 years. 
   In addition, H.R. 3648, as amended, would provide a 3-year extension of the deduction for private mortgage insurance. The deduction makes it easier for homebuyers to avoid having to take out a risky high-interest second loan in order to make a down payment. 
   Finally, the bill includes provisions to make it easier for taxpayers to form housing cooperation corporations. 
   I hope this whole House can join the Ways and Means Committee members in strong support of this resolution. H.R. 3648 restores some fairness to the Tax Code by preventing the unexpected tax consequences of foreclosure from hurting homeowners already smarting from the loss of their homes. Passage today will direct this bill to the President's desk and clear the path for this important legislation to become law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, almost all of us dream of a day when we can have a place of our own. For most Americans, buying a home is the single best investment they will ever make. It is the first step to building wealth and can provide financial leverage for a family for a variety of things, including starting a business or funding an education. Therefore, we must put safeguards in place to ensure that people are able to keep their homes and not be thrown into further debt. 
   That is one reason why I am pleased to rise in support of this piece of legislation that will allow taxpayers to exclude from their income debt that which was forgiven by a financial institution or lender. We cannot sit by as Congress and add insult to injury to our most vulnerable taxpayers. That is why I am so pleased to stand with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in support of this very strong legislation in support of the American people.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding the time. We who believe in freedom cannot rest. We who believe in freedom cannot rest. And today we who believe in freedom must stand up on behalf of the people of Darfur. 
   It is a wonderful opportunity that we have through Senate 2271 authorizing State and local governments to divest assets in companies that conduct business operations in Sudan. While I want to celebrate the work of the Senate, I must celebrate the work of my colleagues here in the House who have been really carrying this heavy load and pushing folks to move forward on this legislation, to the Chair, to the ranking member, to my good friend, BARBARA LEE, who is always stepping up and saying, if we believe in freedom we must step out and make a difference in our communities across the world. 
   As we fight terrorism, and make no mistake about it, the violence in Sudan is akin to what happened in Rwanda and Serbia in recent decades, this is a form of terrorism and genocide. We turned our backs on those populations then, but we must assume responsibility now. 
   The bill would prohibit the United States Government from contracting with companies that engage in business in Sudan. The American dollar should not be put to use to enforce instability and slaughter of civilians. This legislation also authorizes States, local government and universities to prohibit new contracts with such companies.     
   It provides safe harbor to mutual funds and pension plans choosing to divest their assets and prohibits the Federal Government from entering into new contracts. I have already said that. But I really want also to take the time to thank many of the organizations across this country who have stood up on our behalf. Specifically, the work of the Save Darfur Coalition, STAND, the NAACP, American Jewish World Service, the National Association of Evangelicals, and especially the Genocide Intervention Network and the Sudan Divestment Task Force. 
   Lastly, I want to say that all 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were signatories to this legislation. This is a piece of legislation that was a priority for the Congressional Black Caucus under the leadership of our Chair, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, and we are so proud we have stood so tall and fought this good fight. And, as I said at the beginning: We who believe in freedom cannot rest. We who believe in freedom cannot rest, and we cannot rest until the people of Darfur are taken care of and we are looking out for them and their babies just like we look after our own.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I would like to thank the Chair of this wonderful committee for yielding time to me today. 
   Madam Chairman, I used to serve on the Small Business Committee and am pleased every chance I have to take the opportunity to come back and salute all the members of the committee, my colleague from Ohio as well, for the work that they do. 
   I come to the floor today in support of H.R. 5819 to amend the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program because this will bring an opportunity for small businesses in my congressional district to have an opportunity to work on some of the innovative technology that they have been planning over the years. 
   Within my congressional district, I have more than five medical institutions, and the work that these medical institutions have been able to do with small businesses that have been spawned from much of the research is very, very exciting. And we think that the area of Cleveland and northeast Ohio will be a place where we will have an opportunity to put to work some of the opportunities that are presented in this particular legislation. 
   I'm particularly pleased that the legislation includes an annual $10 million competitive grant program that will support and assist women-, veteran-, and minority-owned businesses. In today's fast-paced economy, minority businesses are steadily expanding their presence and are increasingly a driving force in the economy. But, more importantly, we all know the importance of small business. Unlike my father and my mother and many of our fathers and mothers who worked for companies for 40 years, it does not happen anymore that you're working for that same company. And we need opportunity to expand business so that young people coming out of high school and college have a place to work. 
   I'm so pleased to join my colleagues in supporting the expansion of these programs.  
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5819, a bill that will reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs through 2010. 
   I support these programs because they provide a much needed boost in business innovation and job creation throughout the country. These programs address the needs of our current struggling economy by providing funds to small businesses that work with universities or perform cutting-edge research related to the missions of our different federal agencies. 
   According to the House Science and Technology Committee, these two programs provide the most federal support--about $2.3 billion annually--for private-sector technology innovation by small businesses. In these tough economic times, small business innovation becomes an increasingly vital asset to our economy. In my home state of Ohio, the SBIR program has made a significant contribution to the economy by providing $83 million in awards to small businesses in 2005 and 2006. 
   As a representative of a congressional district that is home to more than five major medical institutions, I am keenly aware of the role the SBIR program has played in fostering medical breakthroughs. I am very interested in promoting the ability of our researchers to explore and pursue cutting-edge medical advancements and believe that the SBIR program is critical to ensuring that promising medical innovations can move forward. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes an annual $10 million competitive grant program that will provide support and assistance for women, veterans, and minority-owned businesses. In today's fast paced economy, minority businesses are steadily expanding their presence and are increasingly a driving force in the economy. 
   Today, minorities own over four million firms, generating nearly $700 billion in yearly revenue and employing over 7 million workers. People of color across the country have embraced business ownership and this legislation will allow more of these firms to participate in Federal research and development activities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 5819.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER, Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5819, the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, SBTT, Reauthorization Act. 
   I thank my colleague from New York, Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, for bringing this bill to the floor today. This legislation would ensure that innovative small businesses in my district and across the country have access to the Federal support they need to conduct research and development and to transform their work into commercially viable products. 
   Helping small businesses stimulates our economy. Small businesses account for 99 percent of all employers in the United States and are responsible for generating more than half of all new jobs. In particular, the East Bay area of California has hosted countless small business success stories. Throughout my time in Congress, I have been committed to helping these entrepreneurs thrive. This is why I formed a Small Business Advisory Group, which keeps me personally connected with issues affecting small businesses in my district. 
   Frequently, small business owners need assistance obtaining Federal contracts and grants. To this end, I regularly host seminars to teach small business owners how to apply for grants and contracts, and I work with the Small Business Administration to ensure that underrepresented entrepreneurs like women and minorities are helped to be competitive. 
   Likewise, I am proud to support this bill, which would encourage greater participation in STTR and SBIR--programs that help small business innovators connect with research institutions and explore their own technological potential, contribute to the marketplace, and profit from commercialization. 
   This bill would also expand SBIR eligibility to include venture-backed businesses like biomedical firms, whose advances have been critical to the ongoing competitiveness of America's economy. Finally, the bill proposes a $10,000,000 Federal grants program to reach out to small firms owned and controlled by women and minorities and small businesses located in areas that are underrepresented in the SBIR program. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill would give small businesses access to resources that will facilitate discoveries, create jobs, and energize our economy. I commend Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ for her leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   To the Chair of the committee, Mr. Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery, the subcommittee Chair of this trade agreement, I come from the same community as DENNIS KUCINICH, and I've seen the loss of jobs in Ohio, in northeast Ohio and across Ohio, from CAFTA and NAFTA. But it's my belief, having served on this committee for the past 4 years, and having had an opportunity to travel to Peru, that this is a good agreement. 
   My newspaper used to say, Well, STEPHANIE, why do you travel so much? Why do you go places? What impact does it have on your voting? I said, Well, how can I make a decision on international issues if I don't travel to the country to see what's going on? And I had the opportunity to travel to Peru about 2 years ago under the leadership of Chairman Thomas, and at the time, President Toledo was the President of Peru. Ambassador Ferraro was the ambassador, and he gave me the opportunity to sit down and have a discussion with farmers, with union people and others with regard to what this agreement would do for Peru. I also happened to have a staffer whose name was Jorge Castro who was from Peru, and I had a chance also to speak with his father who was employed in that country. 
   This is an opportunity for us to step away from the tradition, to look at a trade agreement that focuses on environmental issues, to look at a trade agreement that focuses on labor standards, and to step back and say, well, maybe this is our opportunity to say, well, here we can, once again, try and not only lift up the people of America, but to lift up the people of another country, to have a chance to talk to those farmers about growing and having something other to do than being involved in the drug trade, to have an opportunity to say to the people of Peru, it's time for a difference, and that the United States will give them an opportunity to do something different. 
   All of my colleagues have talked about the change in labor standards, the change in environmental agreements, but I stand here, as some of my other colleagues have said, to put a face on these agreements, because it's very easy for us to step back and say, well, these jobs were lost by this. We haven't lost jobs by the Andean Trade Agreement with Peru. We have an opportunity to open doors for them and open doors for us. And I encourage my colleagues, who I have stood with, I am a 100 percent labor voter, but I stand here this evening to say, let's give them a chance, let's give them an opportunity, get broader and change our piece.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus this evening in a special order around education. Today, we celebrate Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. This holiday, celebrated in 14 states, commemorates the announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas. 
   This day was a great milestone in American history. Since that time, African-Americans have made great strides in this country. However, even with those great accomplishments, we still find ourselves dealing with glaring disparities in our educational system in this country. It is time that we stop ignoring this issue and bring it to the forefront of our policy discussions. 
   As our world becomes increasingly interdependent, we as a Federal Government have a responsibility to provide all of our citizens with an education that will allow them to compete and excel in the global market. 
   Sadly, this is not the case. Too many of our minority and economically disadvantaged students are not equipped with the kind of education that will allow them to earn a decent living in order to enjoy American prosperity. 
   In a free society like ours, we justify the unequal distribution of wealth by equal opportunity. However, any reasonable person will tell you that opportunities are certainly not equal. Therefore, I hold a strong belief that it is the responsibility of Congress to make policy that provides the most underprivileged along us with an opportunity to succeed. 
   We can do this by promoting policies that ensure a strong public education system does not leave any child behind. We need to make a strong commitment to our educational system. Our posterity is depending on it. 
   My home is Cleveland, Ohio, and unfortunately it has been rated as one of the poorest cities, where almost half of the children live below the poverty line. It has been proven again and again that there is a direct correlation between economic prosperity and education. It has also proven that good teachers make good schools. But it's so difficult to attract qualified teachers to impoverished areas. 
   No Child Left Behind requires that every State and school district ensure that low-income students have their fair share of qualified and experienced teachers. In high poverty districts in Ohio, 42 percent of the teachers teach classes outside of their expertise. This is problematic, because studies have shown that multiple bad experiences with teachers can negatively impact their students' education. We need to work hard to get quality teachers to high-risk schools so we do not let many teachers slip through the cracks. 
   Another disturbing fact is that only 51 percent of African-American students graduate from high school on time in Ohio. This last year, Cleveland municipal schools only graduated 40 percent of their senior class. This is a blatant failure of our education policy. This problem has no simple solution. 
   We are talking about inner-city schools with a lack of resources and crumbling infrastructure. We are talking about environments where juvenile delinquency is the norm and some students fear attending class, where budgets are stretched so thin and there is no money available for arts and education and extracurricular activities. 
   These are schools where classes are overcrowded and the teachers are overwhelmed and forced to teach from outdated text books, and the list goes on. This is not what we intended for our students. We have an obligation to correct this wrong. We need to do more to assist these schools in securing resources that will allow them to lift these students up and provide them with an education that will allow them to continue on to college and to a good-paying job. 
   It is so easy for Members of Congress to demagog ``No Child Left Behind.'' But many of us have supported the policy, and its intention is benevolent. We as a country need to strive for academic excellence and opportunity in our country. It has been a tremendously difficult policy to implement and administer, but we cannot give up on it. 
   We have a complicated primary and secondary education system with responsibility spread through all levels of government. To reach a high level of educational opportunity nationally is a paramount task, but we must persevere. The system already works for haves, and we have an obligation to see it work for the have-nots.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. I am honored to support one of the many noble causes of the late Senator Paul Wellstone and strongly believe that this bill will address and improve our Nation's need for enhanced mental health services. 
   The plight of families suffering from mental illness is immense due to an absence of adequate social services and the unwarranted stigma surrounding mental health issues. Due to the unwarranted social stigma and a systemic failure to ensure health care coverage, over two-thirds of the people who suffer from mental illness go untreated according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Within minority communities, even greater needs exist for mental health services. 
   According to the National Institute on Mental Health, 20 percent of our children and 26.2 percent of American adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year. As the leading cause of disability in the U.S., many people suffer from more than one mental disorder at a given time. Thus, the need for mental health services is immense, and we cannot allow discriminatory practices by insurance companies to be an impediment to accessing available services. 
   Last year, I introduced H. Con. Res. 86 to express the sense of Congress that an appropriate month should be recognized as Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. Bebe Moore Campbell was a premier journalist who, before her untimely death, authored a children's book titled, Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry, winner of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill Outstanding Literature Award. Through this story of how a little girl copes with being reared by her mentally ill mother, Moore Campbell was able to raise public awareness of mental health issues and heighten the consciousness of this topic within minority communities. 
   In conclusion, I would like to affirm my support for H.R. 1424. This legislation is necessary to assist families who are struggling through the effects of mental illness and will contribute greatly to our Nation's overall wellness.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (HONORING WOODBURY MIDDLE SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the pleasure of attending a middle school in my congressional district. The middle school is Woodbury. I have a T-shirt to represent Woodbury Middle School. I thought I could wear it on the floor of the House, but they told me it was inappropriate attire so I had to take it off. But this is a Woodbury T-shirt, and I promised those students at Woodbury Middle School that this week on the floor of the House I would talk about what a great time I had at Woodbury Middle School. 
   The reason I was there, and let me recognize the principal, Barbara Whitaker; the vice principals, WeMet Smith and Eric Grundton; and teacher friends of mine, my neighbor, Barbara Norton; Chante Taylor, who is the wife of one of my district staffers; Aisha Mason, who is the wife of Senator Lance Mason. 
   But what I was there for we have Ohio achievement tests, and we decided on this particular day at this particular school, we are going to celebrate the achievements of the young people of Woodbury Middle School. We had a wonderful time. The band played. They are doing a production of ``Annie,'' and ``Annie'' did a production. We had a dance troupe that I learned how to do a certain dance with these young people. We even had a chance to quote Nas, a famous rapper, who talks about I can be what I want to be. 
   We had a great time. We had a wonderful chance to really celebrate the fact that these young people are going to do a great job on this Ohio achievement test. So Woodbury Middle School, I keep my promise. Hurray for Woodbury Middle School. Pass that test.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL E. GILLMOR, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, my first comments are to Karen Gillmor. Karen, I stand in your stead. Only 4 years ago, I lost my husband suddenly. All I can say to you is hold on to God's unchanging hand. He will help you through all of this. And as you think about all the wonderful memories and the wonderful opportunities and the blessing that you had to have Paul Gillmor in your life. To your sons and daughters, I say the same thing. I always talk to my son, and I say, ``Merv, just remember all the good times. Remember all the fun you had, all the things you learned, and cherish each and every one of them.'' 
   As a Member of Congress, I rise to speak to honor the life of my colleague and friend, Paul Gillmor. Paul and I served on the Committee on Financial Services together. When I first came to Congress, Paul reminded me of the big  bear, kind of a gentle bear. You don't even know he is really in the room until he kind of humbles into the room. I remember him saying on occasion, Stephanie, Congresswoman Jones, so forth and so on. 
   I was pleased to have had the opportunity to cosponsor some legislation with him with regard to historic preservation. He and I both understood the importance of preserving historic buildings in this Nation and offered legislation that would have provided tax incentives for people to be able to shore up that legislation. 
   Unlike Paul, I was not in the legislature when I first came to Congress. The advantage of having a colleague and a friend who has had some experience in the legislature works greatly. I can remember one time at a Financial Services hearing, as usual, I was going at a witness. Later Paul said, ``Now, Stephanie, just calm down a little bit. It ain't like you're in a courtroom anymore.'' 
   We're all going to miss Paul Gillmor. The beauty of the United States Congress is that it is a bipartisan body where you have Democrats and Republicans who are there and who are able to argue or debate their particular issue. But the beauty also of a bipartisan body is that you have Democrats and Republicans who can get along, who understand the importance of raising the issues on behalf of their constituents, but also understand the importance of working together.     
   I know everyone has already placed into the Record all of Paul's background, experience and things that he did to represent the great State of Ohio. Again, I stand here as a colleague and a friend to talk about my experiences with Paul Gillmor, to record them in my memory, and to smile, because at these times it is often hard to smile and lift up a time of laughter. But I call upon all of our friends and colleagues and his family to look to the good times, to look to all the great memories, and, over time, time will heal some of the wounds.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007. I commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, BARNEY FRANK and Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS, the author of this bill, for their leadership on this issue. 
   The meltdown of the mortgage industry, predatory lending practices and excessive foreclosures is an opportunity for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to reassert its traditional role of meeting unmet mortgage market needs. H.R. 1852 is intended to increase the market share of mortgages insured by Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and to encourage greater stability in the mortgage market in coming years. It raises loan limits for FHA-backed loans, boosts loan limits in high-cost areas, allows the agency to vary the premiums it charges borrowers based on their credit risk, modifies disclosure requirements to provide more information concerning mortgage choices, and allows for lower monthly payments for borrowers who make on-time payments for the first 5 years of a loan. It also extends the maximum loan term on FHA single-family loans to 40 years from 35 years. 
   Predatory lending is a leading cause of foreclosures across this country. It compromises the opportunity to own a home and hinders economic stability, creating greater disparities in wealth. In my home State of Ohio, new foreclosure cases grew by 24 percent in one year. Cuyahoga County led the State in new cases with 13,610 new filings last year. This ranking has attracted national attention with Ohio's foreclosure rate currently at 18 percent which is higher than the national average of 17 percent. 
   Subprime lending provides affordable mortgage credit to borrowers with less than perfect credit histories, but who are still creditworthy. Predatory lending occurs when lenders impose excessive rates and fees, prepayment penalties, and reset terms that can result in exorbitant interest rate increases. I believe that FHA could serve subprime borrowers at more attractive rates and provide fairer mortgage opportunities than predatory lenders.  
   I applaud provisions in the bill that require FHA to provide ``payment incentives'' for borrowers that make on-time payments for at least the first 5 years of a loan. The measure authorizes the department to offer these incentives to borrowers after a period of 3 years of on-time payments. 
   I am especially pleased and support provision in the bill which authorizes funds from FHA profits, to be used for an affordable housing fund. This fund is key because it would provide grants to support affordable rental housing and homeownership opportunities for low-income families. 
   Over the past 2 weeks, I have participated in home preservation workshops, where I have had an opportunity to meet with various organizations and lenders in my congressional district to discuss loss mitigation plans for homeowners that are in loans set to readjust to higher rates as well as those that are facing foreclosure. Representatives of lenders, servicers, housing counseling agencies, and State, county and Federal housing officials have been on site to meet with individuals to discuss their personal situations. 
   To help stem the tide of growing foreclosures, I have reintroduced the Predatory Lending Practice Reduction Act, H.R. 2061. This legislation calls for Federal certification of mortgage brokers and agents and stiffer penalties for violation of Federal law. Additionally, it will authorize funding for Community Development Corporations to provide training and counseling on the home buying process. Not all subprime lenders are predatory, but most predatory loans are subprime loans. This legislation would work to weed out the bad actors that are responsible for equity stripping and other predatory practices. 
   I am pleased that the Financial Services Committee brought this bill to House floor for a vote today. It is a great piece of legislation which I support wholeheartedly. I look forward to working with the Financial Services Committtee to advance my legislation, H.R. 2061 which would protect borrowers from unscrupulous lending practices. 
   One of the first steps toward creating wealth is homeownership and I want to make sure that everyone is given the opportunity to not only attain but retain that goal.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Congressman Payne, from the great State of New Jersey. 
   I am going to close out this hour and take these last couple minutes. One of the things that you make a mistake about when you leave a Special Order is you yield to everybody, and you forget to talk about your own workshops. So very quickly, I am going to talk about the two workshops that I did. The first one was ``African American Athletes: Roles, Representation, and Expectations.'' It was a wonderful opportunity where I had the opportunity to host Jim Brown, the former Cleveland Browns player, renowned athlete, to talk about things he has been doing around outreach and mentoring. I had Keven Davis, a partner at Garvey, Schubert & Barer, who provided an overview of how African American athletes are represented in financial transactions. Carlos Flemming, a VP of IMG, who represents Venus and Serena Williams. Everett Glenn, the president and CEO of Entertainment & Sports Plus, who is an agent. Ken Harvey, president and CEO of JAKA Consulting, a former NFL player and a representative. Jacquelyn Nance, who is the executive director of the LeBron James Family Foundation. And finally, William Rhoden, who is the author of ``Forty Million Dollar Slaves,'' and is a sportswriter for the New York Times. And I particularly want to thank him for taking care of the workshop while I was required to be here on the floor voting on some other issues. It was a great opportunity, and we talked about a lot of issues around African American athletes. 
   My second forum was focused on the declining enrollment of African Americans in law schools across the Nation. My panel consisted of Christopher Johnson of General Motors; Vanita Banks, the president-elect of the National Bar Association; John Nussbaumer, associate dean of Thomas Cooley Law School; Dwayne Murray, the Grand Polemarch of Kappa Alpha Psi; John Brittain, a lawyer from the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights; Karen Weaver, associate dean for academic affairs and diversity; and Pauline Schneider, on behalf of the ABA. She's at Orrick & Harrington. 
   And the quick issue around law schools is that African Americans do have a decline in enrollment and that ABA is responsible for accreditation. 
   So with that, Madam Speaker, I want to yield back my time and say thank you to Speaker Pelosi for giving the CBC this Special Order to focus on the ALC weekend. It's not a party; it's a legislative conference with great import for all people across the country.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I have been waiting nearly 30 years for Congress to enact meaningful reentry legislation, as I have been deeply involved in prisoner reentry issues since my days as a judge and county prosecutor in Cleveland, Ohio before serving in Congress. While Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, I helped establish the ``Pretrial Diversion Program,'' as well as the ``Municipal Drug Court.'' Both programs, I am proud to say, still exist and continue to help ex-offenders move on with their lives and become productive citizens of society. 
   Prisoner reentry is not a Democratic issue. It is not a Republican issue. It is a common sense issue. The facts are clear--meaningful reentry programs significantly diminish the chances that ex-offenders will return to prison. That saves taxpayer dollars and increases public safety. So why not invest in enhancing reentry programs in order to end the cycle of recidivism? That is exactly what the Second Chance Act does. 
   In 2002, two million people were incarcerated in all federal and state prisons. Each year, nearly 650,000 people are released from prison to communities nationwide. Nearly two thirds of released prisoners are expected to be re-arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within three years of their release. 
   The State of Ohio has one of the largest populations of ex-offenders re-entering the community, with about 24,000 ex-offenders returning to their respective communities annually. Of those ex-offenders, about 6,000 will return to Cuyahoga County and almost 5,000 will re-enter in the City of Cleveland. Statewide, about 40 percent of ex-offenders will return to prison. In Cuyahoga County, about 41 percent will return to prison. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year and wasted taxpayer dollars, which can be averted through improved prisoner reentry efforts. 
   Today, I am proud to stand with my colleague Representative DANNY K. DAVIS as an original co-sponsor of the ``Second Chance Act of 2007. This legislation allocates $360 million towards a variety of reentry programs. One of the main components of the bill is the funding of demonstration projects that would provide ex-offenders with a coordinated continuum of housing, education, health, employment, and mentoring services. This broad array of services would provide stability and make the transition for ex-offenders easier, in turn reducing recidivism. 
   This legislation is critical to successful re-entry of offenders. The bill provides as a beginning the essential ingredients necessary to assure public safety and recovery. It will help begin the process of breaking down barriers to successful re-entry and allow offenders and their families the tools necessary to break the cycle of criminality. 
   This is first-of-a-kind legislation that is critical to successful reentry of ex-offenders. It provides as a beginning the essential ingredients necessary to assure public safety and recovery. It will help begin the process of breaking down barriers to successful reentry and allow offenders and their families the tools necessary to break the cycle of criminality. 
   A key component of the Second Chance Act is that it makes funds for reentry services directly available to state and local governments and non-profit organizations that offer reentry services. This is important because these are the groups that are committed to reentry and are ``on the ground.'' And if one thing is true, it is that that state and local governments and non-profits need more funds in order to provide reentry services more effectively. 
   Let me highlight two entities that do wonderful reentry work in my State of Ohio and would stand to benefit from the Second Chance Act: (1) Community Reentry in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Charles See, and on which I sit on the Board of Directors, and (2) the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, formerly headed by Reggie Wilkinson, who devoted 33 years of public service to the Department. 
   Community Reentry, which is part of the Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry, has served the City of Cleveland since 1973 by resettling people who have been involved with the justice system to reduce recidivism and enhance the quality of their lives and the life of the community. 
   Community Reentry also provides prevention and intervention social services to youth in low-income public housing facilities who are at high risk for involvement in drug or gang activity and future incarceration. 
   Community Reentry administers a variety of reentry services that benefit the Cleveland community. Let me underscore a few of their programs, all of which are comprised of ex-offenders. 
   Care Team. Care Team members, also known as ``Red Jackets,'' that serve elderly people and people with disabilities who live in apartments managed by Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA). Care Team members escort residents to the market, doctor's offices and the bank, run errands and assist with light chores. 
   When one elderly woman was asked how she feels about two of the members of her building's Care Team, she replied, ``They're not criminals. They are just like my sons!'' 
   Care Team members are paid employees of Community Reentry. Full time employees receive a full benefits package that includes vacation, health insurance, and pension that is fully vested after 1 year. The recidivism rate for Care Team members is less than 5 percent. 
   Friend to Friend. The Friend to Friend program recruits, trains and coordinates volunteers to visit men and women in prison. Male volunteers are matched with men at Lorain Correctional and Grafton Prison--both located in Lorain County, Ohio. Female volunteers are matched with women at the Pre-Release Center in Cleveland. The purpose of the program is to reduce social isolation of people who are incarcerated and to help prepare them for reentry into the community. 
   Volunteers are not asked to do anything they don't already know how to do, and their only job is to be a friend to someone who needs one. 
   Women's Re-Entry Network (WREN). WREN's mission is to enhance the quality of life for women involved in the criminal justice system, their families, and the community, by helping participants reenter society. The program enhances self-sufficiency and access to resources, increases positive social supports and family ties, overcomes barriers to goal achievement, and reduces the risk of recidivism. 
   WREN provides a holistic network of mental health, education, employment, family and supportive services in a safe and welcoming  environment. It is a place where women can begin the process of rebuilding their lives, reconnecting with family and reclaiming their place as productive members of the community. 
   As a member of Community Reentry's Board of Directors, I can tell you that these reentry programs work, and investing in their expansion makes sense. I urge you to contact your Representatives and Senators so that they support the Second Chance Act and see that it passes the House and Senate as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. This bill provides a long-awaited increase to the federal minimum wage by $2.10 over 2 years--from its present level of $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour. 
   WOMEN, FAMILIES AND THE MINIMUM WAGE 
   I am pleased that, in 2007, my home state of Ohio has joined the 27 states across the nation that have fully enacted a minimum wage above the federal level. Minimum wage female workers account for 60 percent of minimum wage workers in Ohio. Ohio Policy Matters reports that approximately 253,000 Ohio children have a parent who benefits from the states recently enacted increase. Even more will benefit 2 years from this bill's enactment, when the minimum wage is raised to $7.25. 
   While opponents of increasing the minimum wage often claim that minimum-wage workers are largely middle-class teenagers, recent reports from the U.S. Census demonstrate that among those workers who would benefit from this legislation, nearly half (48 percent) are the household's chief breadwinner. The Economic Policy Institute reports that 1.4 million working mothers would receive a direct raise and three million working mothers could be positively impacted by the Fair Minimum Wage Act. Nearly 4 million parents would benefit from an increase, including an estimated 623,000 single moms who would receive a direct raise under this bill. 
   According to the Center on Budget Policy Priorities, in 2006, the federal poverty line for a family of four was about $20,000, well below what most Americans would consider a decent standard of living to sustain a family. Currently, a family of four with one minimum-wage earner has a total income, including food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, of only $18,950, $1,550 below the poverty line.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (HONORING MUHAMMAD ALI ON HIS 65TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man known as ``The Greatest,'' Muhammad Ali on the occasion of his 65th birthday. We passed the legislation today, but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to speak. Those that know me know that I am a huge boxing fan, and Muhammad Ali is certainly one of the reasons why I enjoy the sport so much. 
   I can recall watching his fights and being in awe of his style and gracefulness in the ring. He was a masterful self-promoter, and won over throngs of fans and media alike with his charm and charisma. But it is his undeniable skill that kept him at the top of his game. His style is something that has often been imitated but never duplicated. 
   Muhammad Ali defeated almost every top heavyweight in his era, an era which has been called the Golden Age of Heavyweight Boxing. Ali was named ``Fighter of the Year'' by Ring Magazine more times than any other fighter and was involved in Ring Magazine ``Fight of the Year'' bouts more than any other fighter. 
   He is an inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and holds wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductions. He is also one of only three boxers to be named ``Sportsman of the Year'' by Sports Illustrated. 
   But Muhammad Ali was more than an athlete, he was a revolutionary. He was a man that was not afraid to stand up for what he believed in. His prowess in the ring pales in comparison to his character and integrity as a human being. He refused to fight in the Vietnam war, famously stating, ``I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong.'' His actions led to his banishment from boxing in the United States and forced him to fight abroad. 
   Near the end of 1967, Ali was stripped of his title by the Professional Boxing Commission and would not be allowed to fight professionally for more than 3 years. He was also convicted for refusing induction into the Army and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Over the course of those years in exile, Ali fought to appeal his conviction. He stayed in the public spotlight and supported himself by giving speeches, primarily at rallies on college campuses, that opposed the Vietnam war. In 1970, he was allowed to fight again, and in late 1971 the Supreme Court reversed his convictions. 
   When I was a law student at Case Western Reserve University, Muhammad Ali was scheduled to speak. I was driving down the street in this little boxcar, and I looked out my window to the right, and who was walking down the street but Muhammad Ali. I rolled my window down in my modest way and said, ``What are you doing walking down the street? Get in my car.'' 
   Muhammad Ali got in my car. 
   I had two little boys in the back seat, and throughout the ride to the campus he recited poetry to these two young men. 
   When we arrived at campus, I said, ``Mr. Ali, do you have a ride back to the airport?'' 
   He said, ``No.'' 
   I said, ``Now you do. You've got a ride.'' 
   So he spoke. We drove the young people home to their parents. One little boy got out of the car and ran up to the house and said, ``Mommy, mommy, guess who is in the car? Muhammad Ali.'' 
   That mom slapped the little boy and said, ``Stop lying and get in this house.'' 
   Muhammad Ali gets out of the house and goes to the door and knocks on the door, and the mother almost fainted. 
   So then I drive him back to the airport. 
   That was such a wonderful experience, to see this man of such great talent spend so much time with these young people. 
   I will never forget the opportunities that I had to meet Muhammad Ali. On another occasion he came to speak in Cleveland connected with Warith Deen Muhammad, the son of Elijah Muhammad. But Mr. Speaker, it is such a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the life of the man known as ``The Greatest,'' Muhammad Ali.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Good Saturday morning. Here we are in the House, and I'm proud to be part of that great Democrat majority in the House of Representatives, and already this year we have passed major bipartisan legislation and won real victories on behalf of the American people. 
   For example, just last week, many American families received their first pay raise in a decade when the minimum wage increase passed earlier this year. Our Democratic majority also passed strong legislation last week to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and make sure that America is protected from the threat of terrorism. 
   And this week, the House sent a sweeping lobby and ethics reform measure to the President. This landmark legislation provides the toughest ethics reform in a generation. It will go a long way towards returning this House to its rightful owners, the American people, not special interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have worked very hard to make real progress on issues that are important to American families, and we're proud to be the Democratic majority.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding the time. 
   Usually I stay within the subject matter of my committee. But 30 years ago, I used to work for something called the Cleveland Regional Sewer District. It was actually water development. I thought I was going to be an environmental lawyer. I saw how much money and how much help was brought to the City of Cleveland by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act where we were able to build sewage treatment plants to treat water all across northeast Ohio. 
   This is a comparable bill. It gives communities an opportunity to make better what is not in such good shape. At a point back in those days, we had a river that was suffering, a lot of things that were going on. The money that came into northeast Ohio made a real change about how water, how Lake Erie was given an opportunity. 
   So I rise today to encourage my colleagues across the aisle, all of my colleagues, to support this important legislation and override the veto. Not only in Louisiana do we need this help, but we need it in northeast Ohio where we have erosion occurring on properties and small communities. We need it in Michigan. We need it all across the country. What better way to do this job and also put America back to work? Let's invest in our infrastructure. Ladies and gentlemen, all my colleagues, I encourage you to vote to override the veto and support this Water Resources Development Act.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs. Tauscher, for her leadership on this committee and on this issue. When I went to Congress, I never thought that I would be deploying troops or welcoming caskets back to my congressional district. What I am learning is most of the young men and women who get killed in Iraq are on their second or third or fourth tour. Clearly it must indicate that they need some rest and down time. 
   I am here to say I understand, Mr. Leadership in the military, you think you know what you are doing, but I am telling you I sit with mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and aunts and uncles who have lost people in the military. If all it takes to help them save their lives is to give them some rest, give them some rest. 
   Does it need to be mandated? Apparently so. Let's mandate it. Let's give our young men and women the time they need, down time, to be able to do a good job. I support your resolution and am glad to stand up with you.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6275, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. I am pleased to see that once again you have presented a  responsible solution to the alternative minimum tax from a broad, policy-oriented perspective. 
   The alternative minimum tax is a critical issue for the American middle class taxpayer who does not get to take advantage of sophisticated tax planning and legal loopholes in the tax code. It is time that we addressed this issue once and for all to relieve the American taxpayer from the agony of dealing with the AMT. A permanent patch is what we really need, but today we have to plug the dike once again. 
   If you'll recall, in 1969 the public outcry was so loud about the original 155 families who owed no Federal income taxes that Congress received more letters from constituents about that than about the Vietnam war. 
   It is particularly ironic that a tax that was meant for 155 wealthy individuals has become the bane of existence for millions of American taxpayers. Indeed the AMT has become a menace. Over 31,000 hardworking, middle-class Ohioans in my district had the grim task of filing a return with AMT implications in the 2005 tax year. 
   Without this legislation that number would surely grow. Those are families with children, healthcare costs, unemployment issues, housing costs and the other money matters with which American taxpayers must cope, not to mention higher gas prices. Tax relief is due. 
   As I mentioned after the introduction of H.R. 2834, the carried interest legislation sponsored by my colleague, SANDER LEVIN, we must continue to laud the efforts of American capitalists and the strides that they make in enhancing and creating liquidity in our capital markets, and helping our economy grow into the dynamic force that it is today. I am also aware of the critical role that private equity firms play in our economy. We must be aware that this change in taxation can have a deleterious effect on some small venture capital and minority-owned firms. The color of money is green, but if you are smaller than Blackstone or Carlyle, your firm might be seeing red. But we must also have responsible budget offsets. 
   The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notions of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on that traditional framework I am sure that we have come to a rational consensus that will ensure 25 million more Americans will not be hit with the AMT. 
   ``Taxes are what we pay to live in civilized society,'' but dealing with the AMT has become a bit uncivil.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of Ohio. (VOTING RIGHTS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2007, bipartisan compromise legislation to finally allow the District of Columbia voting representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. This balanced legislation, introduced by my honorable colleague from the District of Columbia, would give her constituents a vote in this chamber while adding a House seat for the state of Utah. 
   Among the capitals of democratic nations around the world, the U.S. is the only country where its capital district citizens cannot vote in the national legislature. Washington, DC, while serving as the Nation's capital, also has many of the functions of a county or state. DC operates its own police force, school system, legal code, occupational licensure and vehicle inspections. 
   Today, the District of Columbia is home to 120 neighborhoods and a population of 572,000. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the population of Washington, DC is greater than that of the state of Wyoming (494,000) and is comparable to the states of Vermont (609,000), Alaska (627,000), and North Dakota (642,000). 
   Proximity no longer means influence in the District of Columbia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports its unemployment rate is 6 percent, above the national average of 4.5 percent. DC's poverty rate is 17.5 percent, five points above the national average. 
   According to DC Vote, DC citizens pay higher per capita federal income taxes than any other state. DC citizens are subject to all our laws, serve on juries, fight our wars and pay taxes, yet have no voting representation in the U.S. Congress. 
   Not only does DC have no say in the governance of our Nation, they have diminished voices in the governance of their own city. The very Congress which holds the power of the purse regarding DC's budget, also has the power to repeal any DC law enacted by its city council. 
   It's time for fairness for the citizens of Washington, DC. As the representative of another great city, I am proud to support voting rights for the great city of Washington, DC, am proud to support the Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2007 and call for its swift passage.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment my colleague Diana DeGette and my colleague Mr. Castle for their leadership in this area. 
   I rise today on behalf of my 86-year-old father, who carried bags for United Airlines for 40 years, who currently is suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's. 
   I go visit him, and he knows who I am. But this man used to walk and play 18 holes of golf. He used to talk to me about golf. He used to talk to me about being just a great daughter and how proud he was of me. And now I do get, ``I love you,'' but I would have loved to have been able to see him be more of the Andrew Tubbs that I grew up with. 
   So I rise in support of my father, and I rise to say to the American public and my colleagues, it is time for us to understand the difference between being able to do research ethically and to get caught up and lost in some conversation about what we should or should not be doing. 
   In my congressional district, the Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, composed of investigators from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, Case Medical Center, the Cleveland Clinic, Athersys, and Ohio State University, is doing fantastic research. The mission of the center is to utilize adult human stem cells and tissue engineering technology to treat human disease. It would be wonderful for them to be able to expand the research they are doing. 
   I met a young woman who is having a problem walking. Based on the research that was done, they took her tissue, did some research, and I don't know all the details, and now she is able to walk. I met a young man who was having problems with cancer. Based on the research they have done at that center, this young man is fostering and doing well. 
   I just say, ladies and gentlemen, vote for this legislation. We need the research.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the gentlewoman from California for her leadership in overseeing this Out of Iraq task force. Clearly, the work that this task force has done had an impact on the elections of 2006 and continues to have an impact as we go down the line. 
   I want to be very brief. Last night, I went home and I turned on the President's speech; and as a good American, I wanted him to convince me that there was reason to send 21,000 young men and women back into Iraq. See, as a young Congresswoman, this is my 8th year, I have attended five funerals: a young man 19, another young man 28, another young man 28, another one 40-something, and another one in his 30s. 
   And I sat there and I looked into the faces of those mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, spouses and children; and it was hard for me to come up with words to explain to them why their family members had died. 
   We can talk about how they paid the ultimate price; but I wanted to say to them, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to let their deaths be just another number in this 2,000, 3,000 young men and women we have lost. So I waited last night for President Bush to tell me something, give me an indication, say, STEPHANIE, this is why we need to send 21,000 more people; and I never got it. I never, ever got it. So it is hard for me to explain to my constituency that we ought to send 21,000 more people. 
   So I come to the floor once again this evening to say to Ms. Waters and all the rest of my colleagues in the Out of Iraq conference, it is the same old song with a different meaning. Same beat, same old song over and over again. It is time to come out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this housing package because it is imperative that Congress take action to assist homeowners struggling today. The epidemic of home losses in this country is severe, with the impact not only causing harm to the families who lose their homes, but also affecting nearby homeowners who suffer drops in their property values and communities who suffer the impact of lower tax revenues. 
   Nationally, the number of seriously delinquent loans and new foreclosures in January and February of this year was over 2.1 million, an increase of 8 percent over the previous quarter and a 55 percent increase from a year earlier. 
   The housing crisis has severely impacted my congressional district, particularly the city of Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland's weak housing market coupled with a housing over-supply has created a large number of foreclosures and abandoned properties. As of December 2007, the number of properties in Cleveland identified as abandoned, nuisance properties was 8,588. According to the Cleveland Department of Community Development, the estimated number of homes entering the tax foreclosure pool in 2008 was 1,000--with 900 homes within this pool requiring public demolition. These abandoned and foreclosed properties exist in every neighborhood in Cleveland, but there are concentrations in communities in my district where the real estate market has completely collapsed. 
   I support this housing package because it will greatly assist my constituents in Cleveland as well as thousands of Americans across the country by helping families stay in their homes while they repay their mortgage debt. This legislation will also help avoid the decreased property values and increased crime rates that often come with concentrations of foreclosed and abandoned properties. 
   I wish to thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY as well as Chairman FRANK and Subcommittee Chair WATERS for their work on these important pieces of legislation. I am extremely pleased that sections of H.R. 1043, the Community Restoration and Revitalization Act, a piece of legislation I have introduced for the past two Congresses, was incorporated into the housing legislation before us today. 
   This bill simplifies the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, ``Rehab Credit'' thereby making it easier to utilize the credit for revitalizing our nation's older neighborhoods, harnessing greater housing potential in underutilized historic and older buildings, and focusing more private sector investment in smaller, ``main street'' oriented commercial structures. 
   The language in the bill that explicitly refers to the ``historic nature'' of development projects is important because, for the first time, it directs state housing agencies to create a priority within their qualified allocation plans for historic properties that can be converted to affordable housing through the use of both the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the Federal historic tax credit. 
   Additionally, the bill simplifies the rules for nonprofit and government agencies who sponsor or rent space in historic tax credit projects and significantly lowers the cost of these transactions. 
   In addition to simplifying the Rehab Tax Credit, the bill would also facilitate coordination of the credit with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit by exempting both credits from the restrictions of the AMT rules. 
   Since its inception, the rehab credit has been responsible for 133 residential and commercial projects in the city of Cleveland, leveraging about $760 million of private investment. Because of the credit, downtown Cleveland and neighborhoods like the Warehouse District, the Gateway District, and East Fourth Street are being revitalized--pumping more investment into the region and revenue to the city and State. This legislation is crucial to furthering the economic development of Cleveland and the State of Ohio. 
   My hope is that as we move forward we shall have the other important parts of H.R. 1043 enacted, as well as further simplification and clarification of the regulations regarding nonprofit and government use of historic buildings rehabilitated with the help of the Federal historic tax credit. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this housing package.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, it's befitting that you are in the Speaker's chair today as we discuss this very important hour. 
   I have the pleasure to manage this hour on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus. And we're going to be talking about black history and women's history, a combination of last month and this month's themes. 
   I want to begin by saying that we will have an opportunity to discuss the state of black women in America and pay tribute to African American women in our communities. We felt it befitting, as we recently celebrated Black History Month in February and currently are in the midst of Women's History Month. 
   Tonight we will begin by highlighting some of the findings from the recent study of ``The State of Black America,'' released by the Urban League, and discussing some of the wonderful women from our own congressional districts. 
   I would like to begin now by yielding time to my colleague and good friend from the great State of California, Diane Watson.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS MESSAGE HOUR -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I would like to thank my colleague for always being with me and supporting me and the Congressional Black Caucus on issues that we present. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to begin this evening by paying tribute to one of my she-roes and a pillar of the 11th Congressional District of Ohio and the Cleveland community, Judge Jean Murrell Capers. 
   At 95 years of age, Judge Jean Murrell Capers is still ticking and kicking. Known for her feistiness and zest for life, Judge Capers has been a trailblazer for many black women including myself in the law and politics. 
   A native of Kentucky, Judge Capers moved to Cleveland with her family 88 years ago. She still resides in the family house located in the heart of Cleveland. Judge Capers credits her parents with her success and longevity to the teachings instilled in her by her parents: ``My parents provided my four siblings and me with what we needed, not what we wanted. The two things that impact on the individual are heredity and environment. The most important thing for you is to learn.'' 
   In 1932 Judge Capers began teaching in the Cleveland Public Schools. She went on to receive her law degree from Case Western Reserve University, which she calls the ``Harvard of the Midwest.'' 
   Raised as a devout Presbyterian, Judge Capers says that the Bible and the Constitution are the two books she lives by. Through the teachings of the Bible and her Christian upbringing, she learned the importance of serving the community. That belief led her into politics. 
   Judge Capers began her profession in law and politics in 1945. She was the first black woman in the United States to be elected a city council member and the first to serve as an assistant county prosecutor in Cuyahoga County. Because of her commitment to her community, Judge Capers was appointed by then Governor James Rhodes to serve as a municipal court judge, a position she was elected to once her appointment expired. 
   A member of my great sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Judge Capers has accumulated numerous awards including the Frances Payne Bolton Award presented by the Western Reserve Republican Club and has been inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame. 
   The interesting thing about Judge Capers' life is the fact that she was born on the very day that Delta Sigma Theta was founded and in the very same year. So we always call her our representative of Delta Sigma Theta. 
   Widely recognized for her gorgeous hats, Judge Capers continues to be an advocate for all people in the community. She still practices law at the age of 95. I can honestly say there would be no Stephanie Tubbs Jones were it not for Judge Jean Murrell Capers. So tonight I'm pleased to recognize her for her life of service and for all that she does on behalf of candidates throughout the State of Ohio and throughout the United States of America. Tonight she's still actively involved in the presidential elections. Though we're not on the same side, I still love her dearly. 
   Let me go on to talk now about the Urban League's State of Black America Study. Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial states: ``By uplifting black women, especially those struggling hardest to keep their families together and their dreams on track, we lift up every American community.'' 
   I want to applaud the Urban League for having the vision to highlight the issues of black women in this country in this year's report. Oftentimes our issues are overlooked and/or marginalized. I would like to share with you a few excerpts from some of the essays featured in this year's report. This year's essayists do a fantastic job of highlighting the many struggles of black women in America. 
   Black women and the workplace: In her essay ``African American Women and Work: Still a Tale of Two Cities,'' Alexis Herman has this to say regarding the inequality women face in the workplace: 
   ``Over the last 60 years, the labor force participation of women has more than doubled, which means nearly one out of every two workers is a woman. However, this increase in labor force participation was driven largely by non-African American women deciding to work outside their homes. African American women have a long history of working outside of their homes and have the highest labor force participation rate among women, 63.4 percent. Not only are more women working, but more of these working women are mothers as well. Further, one in four married working women earn more than their husbands. However, many African American women are concentrated in low-paying service jobs or staff positions. African American women are 6 percent of the workforce but 14 percent of workers earning between $15,000 and $30,000 per year and are less than 1 percent of workers earning over $100,000 per year. Not only do African American women earn less, the growth in their earnings has lagged behind that of white women, 19 percent and 29 percent respectively. At the upper end of the earnings distribution, disparities in the labor market impact approximately 1 percent of African American women in corporate officer positions whose earnings are on average $229,000 compared to $250,000 for white women.'' 
   Taking the conversation even deeper is Dr. Julianne Malveaux, who in her essay, ``Shouldering the Third Burden: The status of African American Women,'' she states: 
   ``The labor market presents the most striking example of the third burden. Black men and women both experience higher unemployment rates than the general population. However, the unemployment and underemployment of black men shifts a disproportionate economic responsibility onto the shoulders of African American women, who then must support households and children without sufficient contribution from their spouses, partners, or fathers. The failure of public policy to create jobs and access to employment in the wake of urban deindustrialization puts African American men at a particular disadvantage and thereby places the burden of family survival on African American women.'' 
   Another article about black women and the foreclosure crisis is written by Andrea Harris, the president of the North Carolina Institute for Minority Economic Development, and she had this to say about the impact of the foreclosure crisis and its effect on African American women: 
   ``Nearly two-thirds of the wealth possessed by African American families is in the form of home equity. Without homeownership most of these households own very little and have few opportunities to build economic security. Half of all African American households with children are headed by women; therefore, homeownership is an important economic advantage for these families. 
   ``The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act was enacted to abolish redlining, but it created a market for predatory lending. A recent report by the Consumer Federation of America notes that subprime loans have gone disproportionately to women and that African American and Latina women have the highest rates of subprime lending when compared to all other Americans, especially white men who receive the lowest share of subprime  loans. Moreover, the disparity increases as income increases. In fact, upper-income African American women are more than five times more likely to receive a subprime mortgage than white men. Since subprime borrowers typically refinance from one subprime loan to another, this translates into projected foreclosures for more than one-third of subprime borrowers. 
   ``Considering that over half of all loans made to black borrowers in 2005 and 2006 were subprime and that African American women accounted for 48.8 percent of all African American subprime borrowers in 2006, it is easy to imagine the devastation that is headed toward black women and their communities. A January, 2008, report issued by United for a Fair Economy says that the subprime mortgage crisis will drain $213 billion in wealth from black Americans, producing for African Americans the greatest wealth loss in modern U.S. history.'' 
   Let's talk about black women's health for a moment. Dr. Doris Browne, president and CEO of Brown & Associates, Inc., had these observations about the impact of health disparities on African American women: 
   ``Particularly striking are disparities in the occurrence of illness and death experienced by African Americans caused by higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and a shorter life expectancy. For instance, heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. However, the death rate for heart disease is 20 percent higher for African American women than white women. In addition, cancer is the second leading cause of death among women; yet the 5-year survival rate is 10 percent lower for African American women compared to their white female counterparts. Also, 15 million black women in the United States are afflicted with diabetes, roughly double the number of U.S. white women who are diagnosed with the disease. 
   ``With regard to HIV and AIDS, 61 percent of those under age 25 with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS are African American, and African American women are diagnosed with AIDS at a rate nearly 24 times higher than white women. Black women are more likely to be infected by heterosexual means, sexual contact with men who are HIV positive, compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Possible explanations for these disparities are the complex interaction of biological factors, environment, ethnicity, insurance, and certain health behaviors or life-style choices. Equally important are the effects of socioeconomic factors such as education and income in creating health disparities. For African American women, poverty, race, and ethnicity play a significant role in lower health quality and health outcomes. 
   ``Overcoming persistent health disparities and promoting healthy behaviors for African Americans is a formidable health challenge. African American women must devote more time to care for their own health needs because health education, awareness, and screening are essential in preventing and controlling chronic diseases in women.'' 
   All of these points that have been made in this wonderful publication by the Urban League point to issues that predominate in the African American community, which particularly fall upon African American women in our country. The Urban League should be applauded for focusing in on the state of black women in America. And we focus in again around education, around health care, around job opportunities, around income within the workplace. 
   When we have been looking at issues around women and the workplace, one of the things that we have noticed persistently is that women still only make about 70 cents of every dollar that men make in the workplace, and we have to continue to fight for our opportunity to be paid equally in the workplace. It becomes even a greater dilemma as we focus in on the foreclosure crisis, which has caused so many families to go under. 
   In the State of Ohio, 90,000 houses or homes in Ohio are in the predatory lending process. I am told that the number across the country is somewhere around 900,000 families or houses in this country are in debt or in trouble as a result of the foreclosure crisis. It becomes even more important that Members of Congress and my colleagues begin to focus in on these issues and try to do what we can to assist those families in the process. 
   One of the dilemmas that we really face as well is, though, that the proposals that have been placed upon the table to try to fix the foreclosure process have not really focused on the people who are stuck in the foreclosure. They are more focused on the banking and financial institutions than on the people and the process.     
   We need to push as Members of Congress to make sure that we pursue other opportunities to assist people who are really in need of our support. 
   It is exciting as we go on and celebrate Black History Month and Women's History Month together that we think about all the great leaders and great women who have come before us in this country. 
   I had an opportunity about 2 weeks ago to be in Akron, Ohio, with a group of women. We were focusing on Women's History Month and that great woman, Sojourner Truth, an African American woman who was a leader in the suffragette movement, even though she recognized back then, even though she fought on behalf of the suffragette movement, that she as an African American woman would not have the opportunity to have the right to vote, even if she won the suffragette movement. 
   We recalled in our discussion this great speech that she gave that was called ``Ain't I a Woman?'' and she talked about that she had worked and slaved in cotton fields, that she was able to till the land just like a man, that she was able to cut down trees like a man and she said, But ain't I a woman? And she went on to talk about the fact that women across this country have worked very hard and very diligently but, in fact, they have not been given the rights or recognition that they should. And she ends this great speech by saying, if one woman can be determined to have turned this world upside down, surely all the women in this room ought to be able to turn it right side up again. And then she said, And the men ought to let them do it. 
   So it is an exciting time as we focus in on Women's History Month that we have a time to reflect on great women like Sojourner Truth and others who were leading the charge to make sure that women had the right to vote and participate in the process. 
   I am excited to discuss in that same vein 22 women, and these 22 women were the founders of my sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated. These 22 women had been part of another sorority and decided that they wanted to be more focused on political and social issues and created Delta Sigma Theta Sorority at Howard University back in 1913, the same year that Judge Jean Murrell Capers was born. Part of their first act was to participate in the suffragette march. 
   I gave a speech the other day that was interesting in the conversation that the people who put the march together, they wanted to push all the African American women to the back of the march because they knew that they would not be able to vote, but the African American women started participating in the march and they said, to heck with this, we're going to be at the front. And so they moved around the march and moved to the front of the march on behalf of the people that are represented. So it was really women who were participating in the forefront that clearly had the chance to give us or set the example for what we should be able to do. 
   I am just so pleased to have had this opportunity on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus to talk about Women's History Month, to talk about African American women who have done such a great job in the process. I am confident that my colleagues would have been here this evening but for other commitments and that is why I have sought to have the privilege to have them be able to revise and extend their remarks so that they can add information to this particular time. 
   It is always great to have a chance to participate in these Special Orders on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus; our Chair, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick; our Vice Chair, Barbara Lee, who happens to be the Speaker in the chair right now. 
   Madam Speaker, with that I am willing to yield back the balance of my time such that the next person who has a Special Order can come forward. I thank you for the time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. And for the RECORD, I want to compliment the Chair, Mr. Rangel; the ranking member, Mr. Stark; and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee for all of their hard work, because I was one of those at the table battling on behalf of a whole lot of people. 
   This piece of legislation will be critically important to children. But while expanding access to health care for children is my key focus, I remain watchful of the provisions that could have adversely affected persons with end-stage renal disease. I'm pleased that there are provisions in the bill that will help measure and, hopefully, reduce racial and ethnic disparities in kidney care, bolster the health and health care of our low-income seniors and protect our Nation's hardworking health providers. 
   As I have said many times before, the CHAMP Act is an example of a socially responsible and medically appropriate health policy that will improve the health and well-being of our Nation's most vulnerable residents. 
   I call upon all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the House Ways and Means Democrats have put our nose to the grindstone and produced a well-balanced piece of legislation that will ultimately provide necessary and much improved care for both children and seniors. 
   Along with providing health care to 11 million children, including five million who currently lack health insurance, it eliminates pending physician cuts in 2008 and 2009 and enacts a positive .5 percent increase in both years, providing for stability in reimbursement and ensuring that beneficiaries can continue to see the doctor of their choice. Additionally, the legislation expands preventive benefits including mental health services and physical, occupational and speech therapies, and reduces costs for seniors, people with disabilities and low incomes. 
   Some of the most encouraging provisions of this legislation relate to health disparities. The legislation provides both incentives and instructions to our national health care providers on addressing the critical and debilitating phenomenon of health care disparities in the minority community. For the first time we identify, codify and target health care disparities with a goal toward eradicating these problems. Additionally, the bill proposes significant changes to the treatment of patients in End Stage Renal Disease and I have proposed a study on its impact on the African American community. Through this study we will learn how best to provide this most critical service to some of the nation's most vulnerable patients. 
   I am pleased that we were able to secure a Medicare waiver for the Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospital Health Systems that will  allow them to provide immediate care to Medicare patients upon operation. 
   While I do have some concerns regarding provisions regarding wheel-chair access, oxygen and imaging services, I am confident that as we move toward enhancing our healthcare systems that these issues will be adequately addressed.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1592, The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. 
   In 2003 the FBI announced that there were more than 9,000 reported hate crime victims in these United States. This means that on average 25 people per day were victims of violence fueled by the toxic fumes of hate. If you are not outraged by this figure then you haven't been paying attention. As a former prosecutor in Cuyohoga County, OH, I know that these numbers are shocking for a number of reasons. 
   In a country as blessed as we are, and with the resources that we have, we still have an absurdly high crime rate. Violence is taken to be the norm. Local news in most big cities begins with a report on who was shot. Then, we have a country which regularly puts out a report on the human rights records of other countries around the world. Is a hate crime not a human rights issue? It has been long established constitutional doctrine that individuals should not be treated differently based on their race, color, creed, nationality, gender or sexual orientation. 
   This Act allows the Justice Department to grant local jurisdictions up to $100,000 to help prosecute hate crimes. It also provides moneys for preventative programs to stem the growing tide of hate crimes committed by minors. In the Bible, verse 5:43 in the Gospel of Matthew, it says ``Love thy neighbor.'' That is what this bill is about. 
   The time is now to pass this legislation. We honor our founders, ancestors, and the people who built this great Nation by ensuring that going forward, Americans from every walk of life can walk down our streets in peace.

This amendment will encourage partnerships between Head Start and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The Johnson Amendment will encourage African American students to focus on early childhood education and participate in Head Start. My home is Cleveland, Ohio, and it is one of the poorest cities in the nation, with half of the children living below the poverty line. Head Start provides a vital service to my community, it allows the youngest and most helpless children to have a chance at the developing basic skills so they are not behind when they start attending school. I am so pleased that my colleague from Texas, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON has offered this amendment. It will encourage more African American teachers to return to some of the most impoverished communities across this country. They will not only serve as teachers but also as role models land mentors to inspire young children to succeed as they have. I would like to once again Congresswoman JOHNSON for offering this amendment and encourage all of my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 63. Today through this resolution, we reiterate our support for our troops, these brave men and women, who even when they did not have proper equipment and resources, continued to serve and protect this country. Today we pledge to offer them the same support they have so willingly given us throughout the conflict. 
   To date, 3,100 soldiers have given their lives in this war and over 20,000 have been injured. I often feel that we gloss over the numbers and forget that each one was an actual person. They were somebody's son, daughter, somebody's mother or father, somebody's brother or sister. They were real people, as real as 19-year-old PVT. Brandon Sloan and 1SG Robert Dowdy, who were the first soldiers from my congressional district to become casualties of this war. 
   There have been many others, including SGT Michael Wiggins, a graduate of Shaw High School in East Cleveland, killed on January 23; or Charles King, a man described by family and friends as a highly decorated, hardworking soldier, died October 14 of injuries sustained when an improvised device detonated near his vehicle; and Samuel Bowen, who was affectionately called ``Smokey'' and always had a great smile on his face. He was killed when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded near his vehicle. 
   At his funeral, Specialist Ronald Eaton, a soldier rescued by Bowen, said, Without regard to himself, without regard to the injuries he had sustained, Sam grabbed me and pulled me to safety. 
   All of these are special stories, but I will share a few more with you about Brandon Sloan and Robert Dowdy. 
   Brandon Sloan was a special young man who exhibited a unique blend of personality and strength, a loving child who played and enjoyed spending time with other children. Later he became a big brother to his sister Brittany, with whom he shared a close relationship. 
   He began his education in East Cleveland and remained in the district until his family moved to Euclid. While in East Cleveland, he developed a love for basketball and continued in various athletic pursuits. 
   In 1996, the family moved to Oakwood in the Bedford School District, and there Brandon became a Bearcat. He confessed his hope in Christ during his high school years and was baptized. Later, he pursued a career in the military where he subsequently gave his life.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I won't do all the thank-you's that Mr. Davis has already done. 
   I want to say to you, Judge, if I offended you, I apologize. But you know as well as I do that it is so important for us to have programs for ex-offenders. In the time that I was a judge and prosecutor, it was those young people that we helped, that we gave a second chance to, that we said to them, all right, you made a mistake, let's make a difference in your life. 
   I can't tell you how many times I have walked down the street, Judge GOHMERT, and young people have walked up to me and said, ``Judge, you gave me a break and I thank you.'' ``Judge, you gave me an opportunity.'' And more than those young people need an opportunity. They need a second chance. This is the program. 
   We can't study anymore. We have studied. There are all kinds of studies that have shown that community reentry works. There is all kind of programs that say diversion works. And there is a lot of young people out here who don't have a mother or father that is a judge or a prosecutor or a Congresswoman or a State Representative to call and say I am a good person. They need us to say in the world that young people, older people, whatever their age, who have been involved in the criminal justice system, paid their dues. They need a chance, and we ought to give them the second chance. 
   Last week we were talking about reading the Bible, the week of the Bible and how important it was to follow God's word. What more important? God said you visited me when I was sick, when I was in jail. Second Chance can do that. 
   And, Judge, all I am saying to you, and I didn't mean to offend you, but if I did I want you to know, your comments that fuel the fire make it hard for us to do a second chance.  
   Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting nearly 30 years for Congress to enact meaningful reentry legislation, as I have been deeply involved in prisoner reentry issues since my days as a judge and county prosecutor in Cleveland, Ohio, before serving in Congress. While Cuyahoga County prosecutor, I helped establish the Pretrial Diversion Program, as well as the Municipal Drug Court. Both programs, I am proud to say, still exist and continue to help ex-offenders move on with their lives and become productive citizens of society. 
   Prisoner reentry is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is a common sense issue. The facts are clear--meaningful reentry programs significantly diminish the chances that ex-offenders will return to prison. That saves taxpayer dollars and increases public safety. So why not invest in enhancing reentry programs in order to end the cycle of recidivism? That is exactly what the Second Chance Act does. 
   In 2002, 2 million people were incarcerated in all Federal and State prisons. Each year, nearly 650,000 people are released from prison to communities nationwide. Nearly two-thirds of released prisoners are expected to be re-arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within three years of their release. 
   The State of Ohio has one of the largest populations of ex-offenders re-entering the community, with about 24,000 ex-offenders returning to their respective communities annually. Of those ex-offenders, about 6,000 will return to Cuyahoga County and almost 5,000 will re-enter in the city of Cleveland. Statewide, about 40 percent of ex-offenders will return to prison. In Cuyahoga County, about 41 percent will return to prison. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year and wasted taxpayer dollars, which can be averted through improved prisoner reentry efforts. 
   This legislation is critical to successful re-entry of offenders. The bill provides as a beginning the essential ingredients necessary to assure public safety and recovery. It will help begin the process of breaking down barriers to successful re-entry and allow offenders and their families the tools necessary to break the cycle of criminality. 
   I would like to thank my colleague DANNY DAVIS for all of his hard work on this issue as well as former Congressman Rob Portman who was the first to introduce the legislation. I encourage my colleagues to support this very important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I am so happy, Mr. Speaker, to have an opportunity to be on the floor with two of my favorite Congress people, Tim Ryan and Kendrick Meek. Over the past few years, these two young men have shown such great leadership in the 30-Something Working Group, and I am just proud to be counted among the 30-Something group even though all of us know I am not 30-something, though I think I manage well anyway. 
   It is just so significant that we have an opportunity to be here this evening to talk about an issue that is so very, very important to all of America: our children. 
   A child. You think about when your baby is born or before your baby is born, how important it is to you to contemplate that he or she be of good health. More important than it be a boy or a girl, it's important that they come here and you start counting, do they have all their fingers? Do they have all their toes? Is their heart working? Are their eyes open? Can they hear? Can they see? And for some parents, it becomes a difficult moment because all those wonderful things that you would hope would be the case are not. 
   But moving along, regardless, every parent wants their child to have access to good health care. And one of the wonderful things about this program called SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program, is that it will provide health insurance for all of our children. And who could not want that? 
   Our President. Our President has made a decision that SCHIP is not  something that he can support. Now, he has made all kinds of excuses as to why he can't support it, but the reality is that 72 percent of the American public support the State Children's Health Insurance Program. And it's not a panacea. It's more than many children have. 
   Now, the argument that the President would want to make is that children who don't have health insurance can go to the emergency room and get health care. Anybody can walk into the emergency room and get health care. What kind of sense does that make? One of the most expensive ways in which to deliver health care in America is the emergency room, and if any of you have been in the emergency room recently, I have. When my father was very ill, he was in the emergency room. And people were loaded. We sat for hours waiting to get X rays. There were not enough doctors, not enough nurses, not enough facilities. And the people in the emergency room do a great job. I commend them. University Hospitals is where I usually go with my dad or some member of my family. But the reality is that is not the place where we should be rendering health care. 
   I am going to move on because there are other people here to talk, but contemplate this: We want our children to be competitive. We want our children to be able to compete with children from China, children from Russia, children from every country in the world, and we want to deny them health care. 
   An unhealthy child cannot learn. An unhealthy child causes a dilemma or problems for other children in the classroom. All of you that are new parents and you take your child to day care and the first thing you know is that baby comes home with an ear infection, pink eye. It's guaranteed. You even get sick from whatever it is that baby has going to day care and brings it home to you. 
   We know that the children of America deserve better. We know that the children of America deserve health care coverage. And we know that all children who are required to compete in this world in America by the tests that we are giving them to be No Child Left Behind that health care is the most important thing in addition to a great education that we can give to them. The most important thing that will give them the opportunity to be successful in their childhood, in their middle age, and in their lifetime is good health care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program is the beginning of that. And it is a shame, it is a shame that we would have a President who would get partisan with an issue so important to both Democrats and Republicans and veto that legislation.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Oh, now, cut it out. You're getting personal out here now. But the reality is that I am a coffee drinker, and that $3.50 could go so much further if we were to invest it in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   And the other dilemma that the President is faced with is, he is claiming about States who have been given waivers to provide health care to those other than children, but it was his administration that granted the waiver. Now, if you're mad about a waiver, then bite your own nose, smack your own face, but don't hurt children over the fact that they have been given an opportunity to have health care in America. 
   And the other thing I want to switch to, and I'm jumping around a little bit, is there are Republicans, there are strong-minded, good-thinking, good-hearted, smart Republicans who have voted with us on the SCHIP bill. In the Senate, 68 Senators, including 18 Republicans, voted for the bill. There are 43 Governors, including 16 Republicans, who have voted for it. In the House, 45 Republicans voted with us on this SCHIP bill. And the good thing is that they recognize the need that we have for child health insurance. 
   I don't know if anybody has given these quotes. Senator Grassley, ``The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him to reconsider his veto message.'' Senator ORRIN HATCH, ``We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this.'' Let me say that again. ORRIN HATCH said, ``I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this issue.'' And SUSAN COLLINS, ``I cannot believe the President would veto a program that benefits low-income children.'' 
   I yield.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I just want to make one point and then yield to my colleagues. My colleague Kendrick Meek so eloquently put forth the debt that we are, as a Nation, in and you think about it from this perspective. Every child born in the United States at the time they are born are owing, owe part of the U.S. debt. They say it's now somewhere between $27,000 and $28,000. If that is a fact, why then can we not allocate $3.50 a day to health care coverage for our children? $27,000 they owe when they are born. They are entitled to $3.50 a day for good health care. It is fiscally sound and it makes great sense.

   Ms. JONES of Ohio. Let's take President Bush's own words. He says, ``I have strongly supported SCHIP as a Governor. I have done so as president. My 2008 budget proposed to increase SCHIP funding by $5 billion over 5 years.'' 
   Now, this is Bush math, because it is a 20 percent increase, according to him. But reality, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the President's budget for SCHIP would result in 840,000 children currently enrolled in SCHIP losing their coverage. According to CBO, due to rising health care costs, the President's increase of $5 billion for SCHIP over 5 years fails to cover the cost of simply maintaining the current SCHIP enrollment of children of 6 million. Indeed, according to CBO, over the next 5 years, the President's budget so underfunds SCHIP that it will result in 840,000 children losing their SCHIP coverage. 
   Even more, the number of uninsured children jumped by 600,000 in 2006, up to nearly 8.7 million children. Yet President Bush, the Bush budget does nothing to reduce the number of up insured children. 
   Finally, what I would just say is, it is not just us saying it. Listen to what newspapers across the country are saying. 
   The Washington Post editorial: ``Children's health check.'' 
   Austin American Statesman editorial: ``For many kids, the doctor is not in.'' 
   Atlanta Journal editorial: ``Kids lose out to politics.'' 
   Chicago Tribune editorial: ``A sound children's health bill, SCHIP.'' 
   New York Times: ``Overcoming a veto and helping children.'' 
   The Daily News, New York: ``Presidential malpractice.'' 
   Akron Beacon Journal: ``SCHIP at the brink.''

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Wow. Wow. The only thing that I want to end on, and I am going to be very quick to yield for the last time to my colleagues Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy, was I participated one Saturday afternoon in a program at University Hospital in my Congressional district called ``healthy children.'' The purpose of the program was to help these children who were overweight understand the importance of choosing the right foods, the right diet and exercise. 
   There are so many unhealthy children in these United States. There are so many children who are suffering from type II diabetes, who are suffering from all types of conditions that could be dealt with given a strong health care opportunity, given an opportunity for their parents to have the appropriate guidance. 
   We cannot afford to let our children down, because when we have children who are unhealthy, who may be overweight, who are suffering from diabetes, it also leads to children who have depression, children who don't want to be here because somebody is kidding them or their self-esteem is low. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, will give our children the opportunity to have a chance, have a chance to be successful in a world where you would think it would be no big deal; that it would be no big deal to say to the American public, yes, we are going to give you health care, children.     
   We owe it to them. We are morally obligated as the grownups in this country. I am just so proud of my colleagues that I am here on the floor with. I am proud to be part of the 30-Something. I thank them for their leadership and their guidance.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 of which I am a co-sponsor. 
   Three years ago last week, Congress formally declared that genocide was taking place in Darfur. For many years now we have seen the devastating atrocities taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan. With the support of the Sudanese Government, the Janjaweed militia has ravaged the people of Darfur, raping, torturing, murdering, and forcing hundreds of thousand of Darfuris to flee to refugee camps in neighboring Chad and the Central African Republic. 
   It is time that we begin to put in place legislation that will end this genocide. This legislation supports state, city, and university efforts to divest funds from, or restrict investments in, companies that conduct business operations in Sudan. This is a positive first step in achieving this goal. 
   We saw the same devastation in Rwanda over a decade ago, and the American people have made their voices heard on this issue vowing never again to remain silent when humanity is threatened. 
   A few months ago, an event was held in my congressional district regarding this issue. During the event it was noted that according to www.darfurscores.com I was receiving a grade of ``C'' in my support of ending the genocide in Darfur. While it may appear on the surface that I have not been supportive of these efforts, it is important that you know I am in total support of ending the genocide in Darfur. 
   I along with many of my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues including DONALD PAYNE and BARBARA LEE were some of the first members of Congress to speak out about this issue. During the last Congress, we specifically addressed this issue with President George W. Bush in a meeting asking him to take immediate action. Additionally, I have co-sponsored and voted in favor of legislation as far back as the 108th Congress regarding this issue. Some of the bills I have supported included a bill for the appointment of a Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan and to prohibit companies that conduct business operations in Sudan from receiving government contracts. Most recently, I voted in favor of legislation calling on the League of Arab States and each Member State to acknowledge the Darfur genocide as well as signed onto a letter to the China government asking them to use their significant economic influence with the Government of Sudan to end these crimes against humanity. 
   While I understand that there may be some gaps on paper with regard to my record on this issue, trust that my support for ending the genocide in Darfur has been unwavering. It is my hope that I will be able to work with the people of the 11th Congressional District and across this country to continue to let our voices heard on this issue. I encourage my constituents to contact me with your ideas and resources so we can continue to fight this injustice against humanity.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the privilege. 
   They say some things bear repeating. These words bear repeating. 
 Southern trees bear strange fruit, Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze, Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. Pastoral scene of the gallant South, The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth, Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh, Then the sudden smell of burning flesh. Here is fruit for the crows to pluck, For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck, For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop, Here is a strange and bitter crop.  
   The words of a songstress, but the words of the South, the words of African Americans from across this country and other ethnic groups. Seeing somehow in America we have begun to believe that this conduct is acceptable, that we can hang nooses, we can do crosses, we can do all kinds of things against people without believing that it has some impact or that it can hurt. It hurts like a knife. It cuts like a knife. My mama from Alabama, my daddy from Alabama, my in-laws from Georgia, Alabama; the stories go on and on about how terrible nooses can and have been. 
   America, this is the Congress saying our sense is that this is terrible conduct and that it should be criminalized. But, America, wake up. What if it were you that got the noose. What if it was your grandfather or grandmother that was hung. What if they were required to hang on a tree and let the blood suck and sip from them and crows gnaw at them. It would be a terrible situation for you. As one American to another, you should cry for us, too. 
   Let's pass this legislation, ladies and gentlemen. Let's tell our country, let us tell the world that we will never, ever allow such a thing or such conduct to happen again. No more nooses.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a proud sports fan from the City of Cleveland, Ohio. Yes, I have said it. What about those Indians? It has been years since Clevelanders can stand up and say they are proud of their professional sports teams and can actually point to success. Yet just this year the Cavaliers made the NBA finals for the first time in franchise history and on the back of our young superstar, Lebron James. After a strong draft in the spring, the Cleveland Browns looked competitive for the first time since the franchise returned in 1999, save one season. 
   But the main reason I stand today is to congratulate the Cleveland Indians for their first trip to the ALCS since 1998. Cleveland fans have been through a lot of disappointment in our sports history. Two losses for the Browns in the 1980s in the AFC championship by a drive and a fluke fumble. Losses to Michael Jordan's Bulls by the Cavs in the Eastern Conference finals in the early 1990s, and most recently in a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series in the 9th inning to the Florida Marlins. 
   As a lifelong Clevelander, it has been difficult to live through so many near misses, and it makes you yearn for the days of Jim Brown and Bob Feller. The Indians displayed such a consistent level, failures during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, that the movie ``Major League'' was made depicting a fictional Indians team that was supposed to be the worst ever in baseball. However, all this disappointment changed in the 1990s when the Indians moved to their current home, Jacobs Field. 
   It was not so long ago that the Indians were competing for the World Series every year. Throughout the 1990s, the Indians made the World Series twice, in 1995 and 1997, and made the playoffs 5 straight years from 1994 to 1999. After a few bad years, the Indians were rebuilding through the early part of the 2000s, and I must credit General Manager Mark Shapiro for putting together a young, talented team that looks poised to become the class of the AL Central for years to come. 
   This year, the Indians won the AL Central crown and tied for the best record in baseball with the Boston, what are they called? Boston Red Sox. I must say, this team is exciting to watch. We have a rising star in center fielder Grady Sizemore, the best one-two pitching punch in baseball with CC Sabathia and Fausto Carmona. 
   I want to give a special shout out to veteran outfielder Kenny Lofton. Kenny is the only player on the roster who played with the Indians during  their playoff runs in the 1990s. Kenny has played for 11 teams in his 17-year baseball career, including nine different teams in the last seven seasons. He played nine of those seasons with Cleveland, and I was so happy to see him return during this season. He provides veteran leadership in the Indians lineup, and his performance in the ALDS is one of the main reasons the Indians have moved on to the ALCS. Cleveland is proud to have him back, and hopefully he can help lead the Tribe to the World Series victory he has worked for. 
   The Indians have been very impressive so far this postseason, defeating the vulnerable--veteran, excuse me, vulnerable now, New York Yankees in four games and closing out the series this past Monday in New York. I can't wait to see them take on the Boston Red Sox this Friday and hopefully win the series to get into the World Series. 
   It has been a tough few decades for Cleveland sports fans, but this year is providing hope for success in the future. This success is so wonderful and cherished by a community that has experienced so much economic loss. So I am grateful that our sports serve as a beacon of pride for Cleveland. I want to thank the owners, the management, and most of all the hard-working, young players, the Browns, the Cavs and the great Indians. And I want to say they do a good job in representing the City of Cleveland. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I just want to close with one more thing. Go Tribe! Go Indians! Go Cleveland!

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (PRAY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE CLEVELAND SHOOTING -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, Members of the House that are still here this afternoon, and people of America, I ask you to join with me in a moment to say prayers for the families of the victims from the Cleveland shooting this afternoon. 
   It is unfortunate that we as a Nation once again face a shooting in a public schoolhouse. It is unfortunate that we once again face children who have access to guns in an educational environment. 
   I ask you to pray for the family of the young man who was the shooter. I ask you to pray for the families of the persons who were injured in this shooting. 
   Day after day we will get all kinds of questions about what happened and how it happened and what we could have done. But today is a day when we should stop and just for a moment say prayers on behalf of all those families. 
   The city of Cleveland is my home. I grew up there. I currently represent it, and I ask you to hold us in your thoughts and prayers and pray that God will give us the strength and the ability to work through this difficult time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that once again we have a responsible solution to the alternative minimum tax from a broad, policy-oriented perspective. 
   The alternative minimum tax is a critical issue for the American middle class taxpayer who does not get to take advantage of sophisticated tax planning and legal loopholes in the tax code. It is time that we addressed this issue once and for all to relieve the American taxpayer from the agony of dealing with the AMT. A permanent fix is what we really need, but today we have to plug the dike once again. 
   It is particularly ironic that a tax that was meant for 155 wealthy individuals has become the bane of existence for millions of American taxpayers. Indeed the AMT has become a menace. Over seven thousand hardworking Ohioans in my district had the grim task of filing a return with AMT implications in the 2005 tax year. Those are families with children, healthcare costs, unemployment issues, housing costs and the other money matters with which American taxpayers must cope. Tax relief is due. 
   As I mentioned after the introduction of H.R. 2834, we must continue to laud the efforts of American capitalists and the strides that they make in enhancing and creating liquidity in our capital markets, and helping our economy grow into the dynamic force that it is today. I am also aware of the critical role that offshore hedge funds play in asset management. But we must also have responsible budget offsets. 
   The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notions of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on that traditional framework I am sure that we have come to a rational consensus that will ensure 21 million Americans will not be hit with the AMT. 
   ``Taxes are what we pay to live in civilized society,'' but dealing with the AMT has become a bit uncivil.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 976, which will provide tax relief to small businesses, the backbone of our economy. 
   It is my hope that this revenue-neutral tax bill will be coupled with the $7.25 minimum wage increase this House of Representatives passed in its First 100 hours. We owe it to hard-working Americans to give them a living wage, as well as provide tax relief to small businesses that would allow them to continue to grow and play a vital role in our local economies across the country. 
   In my hometown of Cleveland, OH, over 95 percent of the businesses are considered small businesses, employing about 58,000 Clevelanders. In the State of Ohio, over 490,000 people are employed by small businesses. These workers and businesses will benefit from the tax benefits in this bill, allowing them to thrive and reinvest in our communities. 
   Let me praise two key provisions in this bill. H.R. 976: 
   1. Extends and expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The WOTC provides employers with a tax credit for employing ex-offenders, qualified veterans, TANF recipients, high-risk youth, food stamp recipients, and other targeted groups. The credit helps break down many of the barriers preventing these Americans from getting work. H.R. 976 extends the WOTC, and expands the credit for the benefit of disabled veterans and residents living in empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and renewal communities. 
   2. Extends the Section 179 small business expensing, and increases from $112,000 to $125,000 (indexed for inflation) the total amount of expensing allowed. The bill also expands the number of small businesses that can qualify for the maximum benefit by increasing the phaseout threshold amount from $450,000 to $500,000.  
   Let me also discuss another important provision in this tax bill, and that is the enhancement of the tip credit. I was recently approached about this issue by a chef and restaurant owner in my Congressional District, Sergio Abramof. Sergio owns two excellent restaurants: Sergio's in University Circle, and Sergio's Sarava at Shaker Square. 
   Fortunately, H.R. 976 will allow businesses to continue claiming the full tip credit despite an increase in the Federal minimum wage. That provision will assist workers and restaurants like those owned by Sergio, so I am very pleased that we are including it in this legislation. 
   H.R. 976 is fair, bipartisan legislation that will allow small businesses to continue to be an economic engine. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I want to thank the Chair of this wonderful committee, NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I was on this committee when I came to Congress, and she helped me understand what legislative bodies were all about, and I want to thank her for her leadership because many times people want to give small business to the Republican Party, but this Chair has shown that small business is a Democratic as well as a Republican issue. And I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for the work that he has done. 
   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1332, the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007. This act is a tremendous effort to adapt the sometimes arcane SBA rules to the American businesswoman. 
   Among the impressive provisions of this act are a requirement to authorize SBA loans for projects that reduce energy consumption by at least 10 percent. In addition, the rural lending outreach program sends a great message to our small businesses in rural areas, who sometimes have to manage isolation and lack of resources because they have no proximity. 
   In addition, by making the Community Express Program permanent, you provide an attractive incentive for the erstwhile disenfranchised entrepreneurs to set up legitimate businesses. These businesses help to keep families together, and eventually contribute to our tax base. 
   I am from Cleveland, Ohio, which at the moment is said to be the poorest city in the Nation. Ninety-five percent of the private sector jobs are provided by small businesses. Therefore, the creation of jobs and growth of our small businesses is vital to our economic recovery. 
   The Small Business Administration's 7(a) lending program is essential for small business owners who cannot access capital through conventional markets. However, the program has been and is currently underfunded, and the burden has been shifting increasingly onto small business owners. Recent  changes to the program have increased the fees to access 7(a) programs, which diminishes access of small business owners. 
   I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for their leadership around this issue. I want to thank you for the opportunity to be heard. And small business is not only a Republican issue, it is a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased once again to host the Congressional Black Caucus message hour on Monday, the first hour of the week. 
   In the past weeks we have talked about all kinds of issues affecting the American people and have focused on issues particularly affecting African American families. Once again, however, we are compelled to this week focus in on the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which the President chose to veto a couple weeks ago. 
   This week on the floor of the House we will again be debating SCHIP and the President and our effort to override that veto. I am confident that my colleagues will join me in overriding that veto because they understand the importance of children in the United States having health care. 
   I am joined this evening by several of my colleagues who will be speaking on this very issue. And I also want to say on behalf of the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, who appointed me to lead this message hour, I want to thank the American public for listening in to our messages. 
   I am pleased at this time to yield to my colleague, my good friend, and my sister from Oakland, California, Congresswoman Barbara Lee.

   The cost of providing health care to children is $3.50 per child. Now, those of us who drink expensive coffee spend more than that on a cup of coffee every day. And wouldn't it just make sense?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. SCHIP, one of the best ways to deliver health care to America's children. SCHIP, one of the best ways and cost-effective ways to deliver health care. 
   You know, I was stunned when I heard President Bush tell the people of America, well, these children have health care already; all they have to do is go to an emergency room. I don't know how many of you had the opportunity, just very recently, to see the news show talking about how the emergency rooms in this country are overladen and overburdened by so many people coming into emergency rooms across the country. 
   In my efforts of obtaining earmarks over the past 4 years in my congressional district, I have sought money for improving the emergency rooms in several hospitals in my congressional district. I've been in the emergency room. I've been there, and the pictures show it, where there are people laying on gurneys in the hallways because there are not enough private spaces for them to use. There are children, seniors, people of all ages in these hospitals and using the emergency room as their primary care. Emergency rooms were created just for that, emergencies, not for the delivery of ongoing preventative care. 
   And the only way that we can make sure that our children are more healthy, the only way that we can ensure that children who are being educated, they have to be healthy in order to get a good lesson. That's why we started Head Start and we started lunch programs and breakfast programs at school so that children could go to school and they wouldn't be hungry. So now that we're feeding them and they go to school and they're not hungry, we ought to make sure they have health care coverage so they go to school healthy. 
   And I don't know how many of you there are listening, but I know you've heard the story where your granddaughter or your niece or your nephew or your child goes to a day care facility for the first time and they come home with all kinds of whooping cough or something, running noses, and it's because a lot of young children come to day care without having received any health care. 
   It will make a real difference in the lives of a lot of people if we provide health care to our children, and particularly preventative health care. 
   The other reason it becomes so important is that an unhealthy child is not going to be able to pay attention in school. An unhealthy child who is not paying attention in school, is not doing well, is unlikely to do well in junior high school, unlikely to do well in high school, unlikely to make it to college. It may be the precursor to dropping out for a number of children here in the United States of America. And that is why this issue becomes so very important and vital to all of our communities. 
   Let me just read to you some of the things that some of the national newspapers have said about SCHIP. The Miami Herald said: ``Vote to Override the Veto of Children's Health Bill.'' ``President Bush's veto of the children's health insurance bill is like Imelda Marcos denying a barefoot child a pair of shoes.'' That makes me laugh because I think about all my girlfriends who have lots of shoes, and they're much like Imelda Marcos. ``The President complains that expanding health care coverage for low-income children will cost too much and lead to socialized medicine. Neither assertion is true. Now it's up to Congress to override this veto. We urge the Representatives who voted against the bill, most of them Republican, to reconsider. Instead of supporting the questionable priorities of a lame-duck President, they should vote to improve the health prospects of low-income children.'' 
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said: ``Some People, All the Time.'' ``Caring for and protecting children is among the highest values of society, and one of its most crucial obligations. On Wednesday, President Bush vetoed a bill to renew and extend the reach of a program that provides health insurance to American children whose families can't afford it or can't get it at any price. Congress now must stand up for children's health and override the President's veto. Mr. Bush's misleading rhetoric calls to mind the warning about gullibility made by a very different Republican President, Abraham Lincoln. As Congress prepares to override the President's veto, those who voted against the SCHIP plan should take care to ensure that they're not fooled all the time.'' 
   The Philadelphia Inquirer: ``The SCHIP Veto: Children Last.'' ``There was no convincing reason for President Bush to deliver on his long-standing threat of veto for the SCHIP bill other than that he hoped to score political points. Bush's stated reason for opposing the congressionally approved $35 billion increase in the program was that somehow it was a step towards socialized government-run medical coverage benefiting low-income families. That doesn't square with the facts, since most of the kids helped by the program are in working-class households. And it doesn't jive with the widespread support for SCHIP among the American public, not to mention the impressive number of Republicans who backed the veto measure. So it's difficult to see how the President's strategy on SCHIP puts any more children first.''  
   The Columbus Post-Dispatch: ``Veto Lament.'' ``President Bush's veto yesterday of the expansion of SCHIP not only leaves millions of children without health care coverage; it can leave many of Bush's fellow Republicans exposed to political attacks in next year's election. Bush said the expansion passed by Congress would cost too much. At $35 billion over 5 years, it certainly is expensive, but this investment in the health of America's children will pay big dividends. Healthy children do better in school and in life. And those who get well-child care in a doctor's office take some of the burden off the Nation's crowded emergency rooms, saving on medical costs overall. Congress' plan, which has the support of the public and backers from both sides of the aisle, would add 4 million children to the rolls.'' 
   The Seattle Post Intelligencer: ``Children's Health: Overturn the Veto.'' 
   It said: ``In vetoing a much-needed expansion of children's health coverage, President Bush distorted the issues, put partisanship over compassion, and defied the goodhearted will of the public.'' 
   And finally, in terms of newspaper endorsements, Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier of Iowa: ``Bush Should Have Compromised on SCHIP Program.'' ``President Bush's veto Wednesday of a bill that could have dramatically expanded children's health insurance came as no surprise. He had promised to do so even before a compromise was hammered out in Congress. Bush's determination, in the face of bipartisan support for the bill and with polls showing the bill is favored by nearly two-thirds of Americans, is troubling.'' 
   All of these newspapers have said pointblank that President Bush is wrong on this issue, that President Bush should not use this as a political partisan dagger, that he should move forward and allow the children of America across the board to have access to health care coverage.     
   The other reason this bill becomes so very important is because a lot of employers no longer are providing health care coverage for their employees. A number of employees can't afford the health care coverage that employers provide. So it is particularly important for these young children to have access to well care, as well. 
   Let me tell you what Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY, Republican, said, ``The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him is to reconsider his veto message.'' Senator ORRIN HATCH, another Republican, said, ``We are talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this.'' I want to echo that. I think whoever is advising President Bush on this issue is doing a detriment to the President as well as a detriment to the people of America. Senator SUSAN COLLINS, a Republican, has said, ``I can't believe the President would veto a program that benefits low-income children.'' I couldn't believe it either, Senator Collins. He should not have vetoed it. But he did. So our job, as Members of Congress, is to override this veto on Thursday of this week. 
   Today, 50 million Americans have no health insurance. That includes more than 8 million children. Eight out of the 10 uninsured Americans either work or are in working families. Jesse Jackson, when he was running for President, Rev. Jackson, used to use the term the ``working poor.'' They get up every morning. They go to work. They work 40, 50 hours a week. They come home every evening. The kind of money that they are receiving, even with the increase in minimum wage, still puts them below or within 200, 250 percent of poverty. So not only do we have poor people who are with no income or low income, we have working poor who need health care coverage. 
   My colleague, BARBARA LEE, spoke to earlier the whole issue of disparity in health care. The studies say that an African American male and a Caucasian male can have the same health care coverage but that the delivery of that health care to the African American male is less than the delivery to the Caucasian male. There are all kinds of disparities in what is going on in health care in our Nation, and this is one of the ways that we can level the playing field. We can get rid of some of the disparities within our support of SCHIP. 
   Being uninsured means going without needed care. It means minor illnesses become major ones because care is delayed. Tragically, it also means that one significant medical expense can wipe out a family's life savings. Right now, everybody is talking about the problem with the mortgage industry, and one of the reasons there are a significant number of foreclosures and bankruptcies is because there are families who have had to pay for health care coverage, and as a result of being required to pay for health care coverage, they are losing their houses. That should not be happening. There are millions of working uninsured Americans who go to bed every night worrying what will happen to them and their families if a major illness or injury strikes. 
   In Ohio, my home State, there are currently 1,362,000 uninsured. It is an increase of 18,000 people since 2003. We have also seen this drain on many of the local hospitals in my district when people are forced to use emergency rooms. The problem is getting worse. As the price of health care continues to rise, fewer individuals and families can afford to pay for coverage. Fewer small businesses are able to provide coverage for their employees, and those that do are struggling to hold on to the coverage. 
   It is a problem that affects all of us. We cannot sit idly by while the people of this country continue to go without health care coverage. We must continue to push. And today is Monday. On Thursday, this House will vote to override the veto of SCHIP. Those of you who are listening across this country, if you have not contacted your Member of Congress, if you have not contacted your Senator and said to them that they need to vote to override this veto, I encourage you to fax, call, e-mail, stop by the office, whatever you need to do so that we can advocate on behalf of our people. This will be an opportunity this week for the people of America to stand up and say to this President that health care is a priority for us. But more importantly, health care coverage for our children is our highest priority. 
   I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work on the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. I wanted to get on that committee because that is an opportunity for me to be engaged in long-term policy development of health care in this country. In my congressional district, the largest employers are the health care industry. We have a large number of hospitals. I want to work to assure the people of the 11th Congressional District that they are going to have access to health care. I want to work to assure that people of America, black, white, brown, yellow, that we are working in order to make sure that they have health care coverage. 
   It has been a privilege to serve on the Health Subcommittee with my good colleague, PETE STARK, from California and a privilege to serve on the Ways and Means Committee under the leadership of CHARLES RANGEL. I have the privilege of leading this Special Order, this message on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and our leader CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK. It is so very, very important that we continue, the Congressional Black Caucus continues to lead on these issues. I am pleased to have the opportunity to lead this message hour in and around SCHIP this week. 
   Again, everyone needs to pay attention to this issue and pull out all the stops and say to President Bush that we are going to override your veto. We understand that you have chosen to go down the wrong path, that you are reaching out to the wrong people and supporting the wrong people. And you are overlooking the most important group of people in our country, and that is our children.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to come to the floor in support of this great legislation. I want to say I am so proud of the Chair of the Small Business Committee. She was my first ranking member when I came to the Congress back in 1999, and I had the opportunity to serve on the Small Business Committee along with Financial Services. 
   We have all been talking about small businesses and how important it is, and it is all right to talk about it. But if you don't do anything about it, that presents a problem. 
   I think about the district that I represent, the greater Cleveland area, and the need we have to do economic development in the City of Cleveland. I am so glad this legislation focuses in on some of those areas. I represent a district that is 52 percent African American, and it is important that African American businesses in my congressional district have an opportunity to sit at the public too and receive some of those dollars in terms of developing their businesses. 
   One of the things that has happened over the years is being a minority business has gotten so good, there are people who perpetrate. That means they pretend they are a minority business. They will get a minority to stand in the front of their business, and the business is really a majority business. Or they will get a woman to stand in front, and it is really a majority business. And this legislation focuses in on the fraud. 
   I am so happy because there are so many businesses that deserve an opportunity to do business with the Federal Government. In addition, there are so many other areas of focus that this chairwoman has put a focus on around small business. 
   If we really believe that small business is the engine that pushes and grows America, let's give small businesses the train to push it. I thank her for her leadership. I thank her for an opportunity to speak this afternoon. I encourage all of my colleagues from the Democrats, as well as the Republican, who truly believe that small business needs a leg up to support this legislation.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our Chair, Mr. Rangel; Mr. Neal, our subcommittee Chair; Mr. McDermott; and all the members of this committee for this great piece of legislation around energy and tax extenders. 
   I know my colleagues have done a great job talking about the energy portion of the bill, so I am going to move straight to a couple of areas that are important specifically to people who reside in my congressional district. 
   In my role as the Chair of the Congressional Philanthropic Caucus, I am especially pleased to see the inclusion of the IRA rollover provision, which has become an important fund-raising and development tool in the philanthropic community. More and more today we are calling upon the philanthropic organizations to do the job that others have stepped away from. 
   In addition, the extension of the active finance exemption sends a message to corporate America that this Congress has their interests at heart because this provision, along with the subpart F look-through, allows them to remain competitive and keep jobs here and not abroad. The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notion of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on the traditional framework, I am certain that we are driving towards a rational consensus. 
   It is in this environment or within this context I am pleased to support this piece of legislation, and encourage my colleagues throughout the Congress to join us in passing this legislation that will impact energy and other extenders in the Tax Code.

   Tonight, however, we will be focusing in on the Southwick nomination. And as we focus in on that nomination, we always remember that for people of color the court has been the place of last resort. Many of the opportunities that we've had to raise issues with regard to school desegregation, civil rights, economic opportunities, equal employment opportunity, have come through the courts. And it is that reason that we are particularly raising our voices with regard to this nomination. 
   I am joined this evening by my colleague and good friend, the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. BENNIE THOMPSON. And Judge Southwick, the nominee, actually is a resident of Mississippi and being considered for that seat which oversees Mississippi and several other States where the population of people of color is significant. 
   I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague and good friend, the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, BENNIE THOMPSON.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank you very much for your time and your attention and your leadership around so many issues, Congresswoman Barbara Lee. 
   Once again, I have an opportunity to invite another one of my wonderful colleagues to join me this evening for the CBC Message Hour under the leadership of our Chair, Congresswoman CAROLYN C. KILPATRICK. The next colleague that I call upon is a former judge. She has been serving on the Judiciary Committee for the past 13 years. She has shown leadership around so many issues. I want to compliment you this evening, Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, on your presentation and the work you did during the Judiciary Committee hearing last week around the Jena Six. Unfortunately, I couldn't be at the hearing, but over the weekend I watched the replay of the C-SPAN presentation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the Chair, our good friend from Detroit, Michigan (Mr. Conyers), but I also want to commend you on the work that you do in and around that area. I will yield you such time as you will consume.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank Ms. Jackson-Lee for her leadership on these issues and for joining me during the Congressional Black Caucus hour. 
   Let me talk about Judge Southwick for just a few minutes, and then I would like to review some of the progress that has been made under the leadership of our Chair, Ms. Kilpatrick, in the 110th Congress. 
   As we were talking about Judge Southwick, you have to understand this will be the first controversial judicial nomination considered by the Senate since Democrats took the majority. It has been 10 months since the Senate changed hands, and the people expect a difference in the way judicial nominations are handled. We don't want to go back to the way they were handled under the Republican leadership. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus and the civil rights groups warned the Senate about Roberts and Alito, yet they were both confirmed. The first full Supreme Court term of the Roberts court showed that we are able to predict how judges will act or respond on civil rights cases once confirmed. 
   To confirm a lower court judge in the face of a bad record on civil rights will simply be too much to bear. Let me step aside for a moment, and I heard my colleague Ms. Sheila Jackson-Lee talk about there being a white judge and an all-white jury and a white prosecutor. I served as a judge for 10 years in the Common Pleas Court, a general jurisdiction court, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. I served for 3 years as an assistant county prosecutor and 8 years as an elected prosecutor. I have been in courtrooms where there have been all-white juries, and I will not say that an all-white jury cannot be fair. But what the law says is you should have a jury of your peers. And the law also says that people should not be excluded from a jury just because of their race. I have seen an attempt for that to happen in other cases. 
   It is so very, very important that if we expect people to follow the law and be a part of the law and be a part of the judicial system, that they have a belief that the judicial system will be fair. Once you have that perception and belief, then you can succumb to the rule of law. In this country, so often we see instances where young men and women have come before the court and they have not had fairness, and that is when it is important to have a circuit court where you can appeal your decision in a trial level court to the circuit court for relief. 
   The fight in the Fifth Circuit is a fight worth having. It has the highest percentage of minority residents, black and brown, of any circuit. At the same time, the civil rights jurisprudence is far to the right. We have already talked about the Jena Six. 
   There is a history with this seat. President Bush is intent on placing someone who has a history adverse to civil rights in Mississippi sit on this court. Charles Pickering and Michael Wallace were nominated, but couldn't get confirmed because of their civil rights records. This is the third try by the administration, and the pattern is very clear. We believe that the President, if he was really paying attention to the people of America, what he would in fact do is withdraw this nomination and go on and allow us to have someone who would be fair and honest. 
   We may not win this battle on a sound bite or our debate on the floor of the House of Representatives, but we believe that the Senate, we believe that this Senate under the majority, Democratic majority, is going to step up to the plate and make the right decision. We expect that they will take a look at his background and experience and make that decision. 
   So I am pleased, as I said, having been a judge, and it is a difficult job being a judge. You have to have the right temperament. You have to give people the opportunity to present their evidence, and you make decisions and rulings on evidence and admissibility and whether it is probative, whether it can be prejudicial. And if it is prejudicial, is it outweighed by the probative value. And be familiar with the rules of evidence such that when you sit in the chair as the judge making a decision, and the reason, and it is symbolic, under the law, the reason judges wear robes, the robe is supposed to cover the human frailty of a judge and allow the judge to step up and be fair and set aside any of their background or experience that would be adverse. 
   So we are concerned about this judge, Judge Leslie Southwick, and we implore the U.S. Senate to not confirm his nomination. 
   I am going to close on a few of the accomplishments that the Congressional Black Caucus has been involved with over the first 9 months. We are pleased to have an opportunity to be in the leadership role. We fought for minimum wage. Nearly 13 million people will enjoy the benefit of an increase in the minimum wage. 
   We fought for stem cell research which provides Federal funding for research that has the potential to treat sickle cell anemia, diabetes, paralysis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. And many of these diseases are prevalent in the African American community, and we have been fighting for them. 
   We fought about student loans. I heard on the news today that George Washington University will be the first university to publish that their tuition and room and board is $55,000, and that the largest increase in tuition is actually going to be in public universities, not private universities. And we all know that most working-class folks send their children to public universities, so we are happy to be in the forefront of fighting for student loans. 
   We have also been pushing for disadvantaged businesses, disaster eligibility in light of what happened with Hurricane Katrina. We fought for the Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007. 
   We fought for United States Troop Readiness, Veterans Health and Iraq Accountability Act because we understand that there are young men and women of all colors fighting over in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is very, very important that they have the ability to have the kind of health care they need and that this government be held accountable for their conduct. 
   We have fought for the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act because so many people were left out as a result of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 
   We fought for accountability in contracting because all of us have learned that many of the dollars that have  been squandered over these past few years under this administration have come as a result of contractors not being held accountable. 
   We fought for the Hate Crimes Act which provides legal protection for churches, synagogues, and mosques against hate crimes. 
   We fought for the Farm Nutrition and Bioenergy Act addressing the issues around that. 
   We stood up on behalf of the Children's Health Insurance and Medicare Protection Act, CHAMP. It was defeated in the Senate, and so it really didn't get anywhere; and that brought us back to SCHIP, which recently was vetoed by the President. 
   We want everyone to know that Democrats are going to continue to fight to be assured that 10 million children in the United States of America have health care coverage. 
   We fought on behalf of the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act, and the list goes on. I am so proud to be in the U.S. Congress. I often tell people the story that my father was a skycap for 38 years for United Airlines and my mother was a factory worker. And for them to have the opportunity in a generation to see their daughter serve as a judge, a prosecutor, and then have an opportunity and the ability to be in the U.S. Congress is just something wonderful. 
   I always tell people if I am judged, and we always talk about honor thy father and thy mother, that if I am judged on honoring thy father and thy mother, I am probably going to get to heaven. Now some of the other conduct I've engaged in may keep me out of heaven, but I want to say I am pleased and proud to be the daughter of Andrew and Mary Tubbs and to represent the Congressional Black Caucus and represent the country in the U.S. Congress. 
   Lastly, I will say, the first time I had the opportunity to sit in that chair where you are, Mr. Speaker, I looked up to my mom and dad and said: ``Mom and Dad, look at me now, I am in charge of Congress and I'm swinging the gavel.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, usually I am not on the floor speaking twice in one day, but two issues have come to the floor today that are of great importance to me. First was the Medicare veto override; and, secondly, voting. 
   Yesterday I had an opportunity to attend the NAACP national convention. Next year that organization will be 100 years old, and in the course of all of the work that the NAACP has done over the past 100 years, voting has clearly been at the forefront of all that they have done, and I am aware that the NAACP voter fund is supporting this legislation. 
   I come from the great State of Ohio, but voting in Ohio has not been great in many years. In fact, in 2004, I objected to the counting of the Ohio electoral votes because of some of the problems we faced in Ohio in 2004, and one of those was running out of ballots, a lack of sufficient machines available for people to vote, and young people in Kenyon College standing in line for 10 and 11 hours. 
   Our new Secretary of State, Jennifer Brunner, supports this legislation. And in fact in our primary in March of this year, we used paper ballots as backup. It is so very important that we don't disappoint any voter when they come to the ballot box because a machine is down or paper ballots are not available. 
   I want to applaud my colleague and applaud the work she is doing. The people of the United States of America are pleased and proud that we are standing up to ensure that everybody has the right to vote, that their vote is counted, and that vote is secure. I thank you very much for your leadership.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

And but for Medicare and the services they received, their last health care probably would not have been as good or as great. We can stand here and talk about, well, the President didn't want to hurt anybody by overriding the veto. And we can stand here and talk about long-term policy down the line. But what we can't talk about is the health disparities that exist in our country and the study that was recently released that talked about minorities have more amputations than any other group of folks in America. And it doesn't talk about the issue of diabetes that overrides the minority communities across this country. Come on, y'all, let's get a life. Let's wake up, and let's help these seniors by overriding this veto. 
   And if we want to talk about better health care, better policy down the line, then let's do it. But let's not do it on the backs of the seniors who have worked all of their lives in order for us to be here to even be in Congress. Thank God I had a mom and a dad.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (PREDATORY LENDING -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join my colleague, Mr. Cummings, as he organizes this hour around predatory lending. 
   I rise today to speak out against the issue of predatory lending within the subprime lending industry. 
   I came to Congress in 1999, served on the Committee on Financial Services, and started instantly raising the issue of predatory lending practices. One of the things that we have learned is that all subprime lenders are not predatory lenders, but all predatory lenders are subprime lenders. 
   Let me say it again. All subprime lenders are not predatory lenders, but all predatory lenders are subprime lenders. In fact, subprime lending has been a way in which many people who have been locked out of and left out of the credit area, or having an opportunity to have credit, have been able to come in. But what has come in with that practice are these predators who prey on our communities. 
   I have heard from countless constituents in my district regarding this issue. As you know, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) said, Ohio has one of the highest rates of foreclosure in the country. Members of my community who have owned homes for years are being forced with foreclosure, after owning a home for more than 40 years in some cases. 
   Seniors are being affected at a disproportionate rate. Lenders prey on seniors who have been in their homes all of their lives and have a substantial amount of equity in their home. They get them on the phone and say: ``Oh, Ms. Jones, do you need a new kitchen? Oh, I can help you get a new kitchen and it won't cost you any money. But, Ms. Jones, you might need a driveway also. Let me help you out.'' 
   And it goes on. So they enter into this agreement. They enter into these balloon and adjustable rate mortgages that look attractive and are affordable in their initial stages. However, after 2 years or more, these loans readjust to much higher payments with higher interest rates. 
   For instance, one of my constituents is currently in an adjustable rate mortgage which locked in a payment of $1,088 for 2 years. After 2 years, the mortgage payment increased to $1,488. And 3 months later, the payment increased to $1,715. This payment increase has had a significant impact on this individual's budget, and because they are not in a position to refinance, they are currently facing foreclosure. And that was one of the deals made in the early predatory lending situations. 
   ``Oh, get it now. The interest rate is going to go down, and you will be able to refinance or purchase your house.'' The thing they don't say is often the appraisal far exceeds the value of the home, and if it exceeds the value of the home, by the time they get ready to refinance, they owe more on the home than the home is worth. 
   Creating wealth is the most fundamental goal of minorities that seek economic equity. One of the first steps towards creating wealth is home ownership. The equity from owning a home is often the only means to secure funding for a new business, college tuition or retirement. I know my girlfriend, Barbara Lee, talked about her home was the way in which she started her first business. 
   Predatory lending targets low-income and minority communities. It compromises the opportunity to own a home, and hinders economic stability, creating greater disparities in wealth. 
   Mr. Kucinich went through a lot of the statistics with regard to predatory lending and issues that came through the Nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending, so I won't try and go after that again. But what I will say, predatory lending has expanded its reach beyond mortgage lending. Predatory practices are becoming increasingly prevalent in refund anticipation, auto and payday loans. There were over 12 million refund anticipation loan borrowers in 2003. That is where you go into the place and they say, ``Oh, you are going to file your taxes. Let me give you a loan on your taxes and you can get your money right now,'' and the interest rate is outrageous. 
   Tax preparers and lenders strip about $1.57 billion in fees each year from the earned income tax credit paid to working families, according to a 2005 study. 
   It is also estimated that predatory payday lending practices cost American families $4.2 billion annually. Understand that the reason that the payday loan people have been able to come into our community is because often some of the traditional lending institutions have left the community and people have nowhere to operate. There are people who never get a checking or credit account. They pay their bills in cash. How can that be in the United States of America, but it is true. They walk up and want to pay the phone bill and the light bill and gas bill. 
   Anyway, I have been hollering, screaming, dancing about this issue since 1999. It is unfortunate that the only way we come to pay attention to this issue is when it begins to have an impact or threat to corporations and financial mortgage security industries in our country.  
   The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending projects that as this year ends, 2.2 million households in the subprime market will either have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold subprime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 billion, primarily in lost home equity. 
   It is also projected that one out of five (19 percent) subprime mortgages originated during the past two years will end in foreclosure. This rate is nearly double the projected rate of subprime loans made in 2002, and it exceeds the worst foreclosure experience in the modern mortgage market, which occurred during the ``Oil Patch'' disaster of the 1980s. 
   The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending analyzed 15.1 million subprime loans from 1998 through 2006 and found that only about 1.4 million were for first-time home buyers. Most were for refinancing. To date, more than 500,000 of those subprime borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosures. An additional 1.8 million are likely to follow as the market deteriorates. That's nearly 2.4 million lost homes. 
   In Ohio the foreclosure epidemic went from bad to much worse last year as the number of new cases grew by nearly 24% from 2005. Cuyahoga county led the state in new cases with 13,610 new filings last year. This ranking has attracted national attention with Ohio's foreclosure rate currently at 18% which is higher than the national average of 17%. The problem has gone from bad to worse and from worse to regress in Ohio, with $7,479 filings in February 2007 alone. 
   Predatory lending has expanded its reach beyond mortgage lending. Predatory practices are becoming increasingly prevalent in refund anticipation, auto, and payday loans. 
   There were over 12 million Refund Anticipation Loan borrowers in 2003. Tax preparers and lenders strip about $1.57 billion in fees each year from the earned-income tax credits paid to working parents, according to a 2005 study by the National Consumer Law Center. 
   It is also estimated that Predatory payday lending practices cost American families $4.2 billion annually. In addition, research indicates that minorities pay on average $2,000 more  per vehicle purchased than nonminorities. Predatory auto lending is taking an estimated $2 billion dollars a year out of African American communities alone.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (WORLD SOCIAL WORK DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud recognition of World Social Work Day. First off I would like to extend my gratitude to all social workers for the important work they do. It is selfless work that impacts the most impoverished and sick among us. Your hard work assists millions of individuals, families and communities across the country and the globe. 
   I have always been a strong advocate for social workers. The field of social work can be a thankless profession which is not very lucrative, so having fully trained professional social workers is always a blessing. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, I introduced a bill that would provide loan forgiveness to social workers who work for child protective agencies. I hear from students all the time who express desire to work as a social worker, but may choose a different field in order to be able to pay for their education. 
   I want to encourage people who are interested and have a desire to become a social worker, and not have them choose a different career based on the cost of their education. Their work is vital to my community and to all communities, and we need to encourage young people's interest in social work. 
   This year's theme for National Professional Social Work Month is ``Hope and Health.'' My home is Cleveland, Ohio, and we have been rated as one of the most impoverished cities in the nation. With so many individuals unemployed and unable to provide for themselves or their families, a strong social worker presence is vital for my community. 
   Thirty-two percent of Clevelanders live below the poverty line. 
   Almost half of the children live below the poverty line compared to a national average of 18 percent. 
   Nineteen percent of those children lack any type of health coverage. 
   There are over 21,000 social workers in the state of Ohio, and the majority of them work in the fields of Mental Health, Child and Family Welfare, Health, and Aging. 
   I would like to highlight North East Ohio Health Services, which is a behavioral health care organization that provides services to the residents of Cuyahoga County. They have many programs that reach children through seniors in crisis intervention to continuing care. I am grateful for organizations like North East Ohio Health Services that employ social workers to assist my constituents with the greatest need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the House who are social workers, and especially Congressman Ciro Rodriguez for arranging this special order to recognize World Social Work Day. And I would like to reiterate my deepest respect and admiration to all the people who choose to devote their lives and careers to providing a helping hand to the most desperate among us.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, tonight I'm joined by members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the first of what will be many CBC message hours. This evening we will be discussing health care disparities, as well as the SCHIP program, which is the State insurance health program. 
   But before I get into it, I need to ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subjects that I just mentioned, that of health care disparity and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   For the past few Congresses, the CBC has made confronting health disparities one of its major initiatives. We have been champions for access to affordable health care, meaningful coverage for prescription medications for every American, and increased representation of African Americans across all health care professions. 
   The health care statistics are staggering in the African American community. While African Americans comprise approximately 12 percent of the U.S. population, in 2000 they represented 19.6 percent of the uninsured. The African American AIDS diagnosis rate was 11 times that of the White diagnosis rate, 23 times more for women and nine times more for men. 
   African Americans are two times more likely to have diabetes than whites, four times more likely to see their diabetes progress to end-stage renal disease, and four times more likely to have a stroke. And African Americans are only 2.9 percent of the doctors, 9.2 percent of the nurses, 1.5 percent of dentists, and 0.4 percent of health care administrators. Yet African Americans comprise 12 percent of our population. 
   These problems are just the tip of the iceberg. Tonight, along with my colleagues, we will outline some of the various health issues that currently impact the African American community. Additionally, many of us have legislation that we are working to have passed to provide necessary care and resources to the African American community. 
   I want to thank the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK, and our executive director, Dr. Joe Leonard, for their assistance and work in this effort, and for the record, my communications director Nicole Williams. 
   At this point I'd like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. BOBBY SCOTT.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Scott, thank you very much for your leadership on that issue. 
   Let me speak for a moment about another piece of legislation that I've introduced with regard to health care disparities. About 7 years ago, one of my staffers approached me with an idea for a piece of legislation. He told me a story of one of his female friends who had been suffering from uterine fibroids. Her condition had taken a tremendous toll on both her and her family, mainly because she was unsure of her options. 
   This young lady is not alone. There are many women across this country who are silently dealing with this painful, sometime deadly, disease. 
   Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that form within a woman's uterine lining. It is estimated that three in every four American women have uterine fibroids, with one in four women seeking medical care for the condition. African American women are three to nine times more likely to develop uterine fibroids. 
   Uterine fibroids can be hard diseases to combat, given the fact that women are diagnosed with the disease at various stages and physical conditions. While the fibroids may develop slowly in some women, others may develop more aggressively. 
   Right now, hysterectomy is the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for 200,000, or 30 percent, of all hysterectomies in the United States. It is for this reason that I have reintroduced the Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act to find new and better ways to treat, or even cure, uterine fibroids. 
   The Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act would double Federal funding for uterine fibroid research and fund a public education campaign on the condition. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland introduced companion legislation in the Senate, and we introduced identical legislation in the 109th Congress, but neither received a floor vote. 
   Even though an estimated three-quarters of all reproductive-age women have uterine fibroids, little is known about them, and there are still few good treatment options available. Women deserve better. I have made it a priority to make sure women are not left out or left behind when it comes to health care. 
   This legislation would authorize $30 million in Federal funding for uterine fibroid research each year for 5 years, doubling the budget from last year's $15 million. Research is needed to find out what causes uterine fibroids, why African American women are disproportionately affected, and what can be done to prevent and treat the condition.  
   It is time that we put the health of the women of America in the forefront of our agenda. Therefore, I'm asking all to be supportive on this crucial issue. 
   Right now I'd like to yield such time as she may consume to Representative Donna Christensen, who is, in fact, a medical doctor; and she chairs the Congressional Black Caucus Health Disparities Health Brain Trust. And this weekend in the Virgin Islands you're hosting a health care health disparities conference, correct?

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure at this time to have the opportunity to yield to the awesome Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She has shown such great leadership not only in this role but as Chair of so many other events that the Congressional Black Caucus has done. 
   I yield to my sister, the Congresswoman from the great State of Michigan, CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Madam Chair, for that great presentation and for your leadership. 
   Being uninsured means going without needed care. It means minor illnesses become major ones because care is delayed. Tragically, it also means that one significant medical expense can wipe out a family's life savings.  There are millions of working uninsured Americans who go to bed worrying about what will happen to them and their families if a major illness or injury strikes. 
   In my home State of Ohio, there are currently 1,362,000 uninsured, an increase of 18,000 people since 2003. We've also seen the strain on many of the local hospitals in my district when people are forced to use emergency rooms as their source of primary care. The problem is getting worse. As the price of health care continues to rise, fewer individuals and families can afford to pay for the coverage. Fewer small businesses are able to provide coverage for their employees, and those that do are struggling to hold on to the coverage they offer. It is a problem that affects all of us, and we cannot sit idly by while the people of this country continue to go without health insurance. 
   I am pleased at this juncture to yield such time as she may consume to my colleague and good friend from the great State of Texas, Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the State Children's Health Insurance Program is one of the most important priorities for the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me give you some information about SCHIP. 
   Of children living in rural areas, one in three children have health care coverage through SCHIP or Medicaid. More than half of all those whose family income is under $32,180 receive health care coverage through Medicaid or SCHIP. Of the 50 counties with the highest rate of uninsured, 44 are rural counties, with many located in the most remote and isolated parts of the country. Because SCHIP's goal is to reduce the number of uninsured children, reauthorizing and increasing support for this program will be crucial to helping the uninsured in these counties and reducing the 17 percent of uninsured. 
   Let's talk about children living in urban areas. One in four children have health care coverage through SCHIP or Medicaid. More than half of all the children whose family income is under $32,180 receive health care coverage through Medicaid or SCHIP. Nineteen percent continue to be uninsured. Because SCHIP's goal is to reduce the number of uninsured children, reauthorizing and increasing the support will be crucial in this area. 
   Let me talk about minority children just for a moment. SCHIP had a dramatic effect in reducing the number of uninsured minority children and providing them access to health care. Between 1996 and 2005, the percentage of low-income African American and Hispanic children without insurance decreased substantially. In 1998, roughly 30 percent of Latino children, 20 percent of African American children, and 18 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander children were uninsured. After SCHIP's enactment, those numbers have dropped by 2004 to about 21 percent, 12 percent, and 8 percent. 
   Half of all African American and Hispanic children are already covered by SCHIP or Medicaid. More than 80 percent of the uninsured African American children and 70 percent of the uninsured Hispanic children are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP, so reauthorizing and increasing support will be crucial to insuring this population. 
   One of the discussions that we have been having about the program is apparently the difficulty in getting young children enrolled in the program, whether they are African American, Hispanic, low-income, rural, or urban. One of the things that we have been talking about with the reauthorization is implementing new ways in which we can enroll children and get parents on board with providing health care to their children. The beauty of the program, as we have talked about previously, is the preventive arm of the program, so that children who have injuries or conditions can get treatment early in the process so that their problems will not escalate. 
   One of the exciting things that is going on this weekend is the fact that the Congressional Black Caucus is going to be participating in health care disparity events all over the country. In South Carolina, Congressman Clyburn will be hosting a health and wellness event in Charleston this coming weekend. The 5th Annual Tri-Caucus Minority Health Summit will be held in San Diego, California. As I said previously, Representative Donna Christensen will be hosting an event in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. 
   We continue to be concerned about the SCHIP program. We are supportive of reauthorization. We are not only supportive, we are demanding reauthorization and requiring that the amount of money that is put into the program be extended such that it will cover most of the young men and women, or children, excuse me, in America. There is some debate about whether or not pregnant women ought to be included in this process. But the reality is, if we don't take care of pregnant women, the children will suffer as a result. So we are moving forward with those issues, as well. 
   I want to close with just a few more additional facts in and around the issue of health care disparities, because we can never say enough about the impact that it has. Let me talk to you for a moment about amputation. The differences in amputation rates reveal one of the many treatment disparities that exist between racial and ethnic minorities. In general, African Americans and Latinos have higher rates of lower extremity amputation than non-Hispanic whites. It brings to my mind an aunt that I have. Her name is Evelyn Shelton. She is in a nursing facility, having lost both of her legs as a result of a condition of diabetes. Among Medicare beneficiaries, the rate of amputation of all or part of the lower limb was 6.7 percent per 1,000 for African Americans and 1.9 percent per 1,000 for whites. 
   Let's talk about asthma care. Asthma rates are disproportionately high among racial and ethnic minorities, particularly among the African American community. Moreover, disparities also appear to exist in how asthma is treated in minority populations, with racial and economic minorities often receiving inadequate asthma care. Insured African Americans with asthma are more likely than insured whites to be hospitalized for asthma-related health conditions and are less likely to be treated by an asthma specialist. 
   African American children are about three times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than their white peers, and about five times more likely to seek care at an emergency room. Among families in which parents lack any postsecondary education and do not have access to a primary care physician, African American and Latino children with asthma are more likely than white children to underuse routine medications, such as anti-inflammatory agents. 
   There are other facts that I would like to go on and discuss at the moment, but I don't have the time. There are issues around cancer care, there are issues around, cardiovascular care, there are issues around HIV treatment. 
   But I am pleased to stand this evening with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss the issue of health disparity and to bring attention to those State Children's Health Insurance Program. This is the first of future hours that the Congressional Black Caucus will be hosting on issues that affect the African American community, and particularly but often affect the entire community of our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleague Baron Hill, we came to Congress at the same time, and I thank you for having the opportunity to speak out on these issues.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I don't know whether I did or not. I wanted to come to the floor and say how proud I am of my ``sons,'' Kendrick and Tim. Actually, they are not my sons, but I call them that anyway. 
   But I come here and look, and I have Anna and Mary who are visiting the House floor today, and these two young women are examples of how important SCHIP could be to the children of America. I am so glad they had a chance to join me with one of my good friends, Robin. We serve on a couple of  committees together, and this is what we talk about, bipartisan action on the floor of the House. 
   Ladies, thank you so much for coming to visit with me. I will take this pink sweater and this red ribbon and I will look gorgeous. 
   But I am glad to join my colleagues here on the floor of the House as we talk about the economic stimulus, because the people of Ohio need a stimulus. They need jobs, they need health care, and they need jobs that make real money. They need to be saved from these mortgage brokers who have hurt them deeply. 
   I recognize my ``sons,'' of whom I am so very proud.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3915, The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. For the past 8 years I have introduced the Predatory Lending Practices Reduction Act, which seeks to establish a mortgage licensing system for mortgage brokers. It also provides grants to nonprofit community development corporations to educate and train borrowers and community groups regarding illegal and inappropriate predatory lending practices. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 3915 incorporates language from my bill that establishes a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry to license and register individual mortgage brokers, and register bank employees that originate mortgages. I believe that brokers should be prohibited from being the original provider of loans, loan originators, without having first obtained, and continue to maintain, registration within the NMLSR. 
   This legislation has been warranted for a very long time. I have been preaching about this issue since I came to Congress as a member of the Financial Services Committee. We are facing a national housing crisis and without this legislation, the problem will only get much worse. 
   The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending projects that as this year ends, 2.5 million households in the sub-prime market will either have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold sub-prime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 billion, primarily in lost home equity. 
   In Ohio, and particularly in my congressional district, the problem has gone from bad to worse with nearly 42 percent of loans generated in the past year being sub-prime, and an estimated one in six sub-prime loans in the district will ultimately end in foreclosure. These sub-prime foreclosures will result in price declines for more than 198,000 surrounding homes, with homeowners in my district losing about $249 million in equity. 
    Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman FRANK and the Financial Services Committee on their hard work and commitment to this issue. I am glad to see this bill on the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this meaningful and necessary legislation.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, there is a God. For the past 8 years I have introduced legislation called the Predatory Lending Reduction Act, saying to the community and the world that there is a problem happening out here. And here we are in 2007, some 8 years later, and there is a wake-up call going on. 
   Across the country, people are having problems with their mortgages and communities are losing tax underwriting as a result thereof. I am pleased that H.R. 3915 incorporates language from the Predatory Lending Reduction Act that I introduced 8 years ago and that it requires a licensing and registration for mortgage brokers. 
   We all know that all subprime lenders are not predatory lenders, but we also know that all predatory lenders are subprime lenders, and we have to get on top of this. 
   Thank God we are saving the people of America.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, DIANE WATSON, for organizing this event. 
   You know, when I think of JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, I think of this  piece of poetry called ``A Phenomenal Woman.'' In one of the lines in that piece of poetry, it says, ``Does my sexiness upset you? Do you find it awful hard that I dance like I have oil wells growing in my back yard?'' And JUANITA was like that. She danced and she walked and she showed off, and that is what I loved most about her. 
   When I came to Congress, I learned that we had Alabama roots. I learned that she was an AKA and I was a Delta. And on the floor of the House I would wear pink, and she would say, oh, you look good in that pink. And I would say, oh it is only faded red that I have on, because Deltas wore red. 
   We talked about issues affecting women. It was as a result of her work and that of Bob Ney that I had an opportunity to bring the Secretary of State of Ohio before a hearing and get him to answer questions. I thank JUANITA for that, to my best. 
   But I think the thing that JUANITA and I talked about most, and my words are to you, Keith, that she loved you. We talked about our sons. And African American sons are so important in the lives of mothers. And we used to talk about you. And I used to talk about Mervyn. And she loved her daughters, but we talked about our boys. 
   And I just want to say to the family, Jim and all, that we here in the Congress will miss JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. But the thing that we will always remember is she was right there on that aisle, right there, just sitting there talking, smiling, walking, being involved. And we thank God for JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. 
   And, God, you know, AKAs came first, but the Deltas were second. So I will always think of her as my sister. We are from the same root.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues, both on the Democratic and Republican side, for introducing this legislation. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Act of 2007. 
   It comes as no surprise to most Americans that when debt is forgiven by lending institutions in a foreclosure, this amount must be included as income in their tax statement. In a time of rising foreclosures, I cannot imagine anything more upsetting to a family than this scenario. The situation usually occurs when the family cannot pay their mortgage and then must give up their home. Then they must pay tax on phantom income when the lender forgives some part of the homeowner's mortgage. 
   More than 8 years ago, I introduced a piece of legislation called the Predatory Lending Reduction Act of 2001, I believe it was. And in that legislation, I suggested that we needed to monitor or regulate mortgage brokers. 
   The reason I raised the issue is because most of the subprime lending that occurs in America comes through brokers who are brokering subprime lending mortgages. 
   The reason I'm so concerned about the statement of my colleague before about this taxation should not be permanent, the reality is, for many families who lose their homes as a result of the situation we're in, it's permanent. It's permanent loss of assets that would pass from one generation to the next. And they can never recover from it. It's permanent loss for communities  where the tax duplicate is reduced because they don't have that money upon which they can build a rating so that that community could then borrow money on a bond. It's a permanent loss for public school systems that no longer receive the tax that you allow them to be able to support that public school system. So this legislation is very, very important. 
   And whatever happens in the housing market, and hopefully we're going to get a hold on these subprime lenders who have devastated permanently our communities across the United States of America, we're going to get a hold on that. But in the interim, let's give the people who are in this position a break.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is like deja vu. We were right here last night talking about many of these same issues. But these issues are so very important to the people of America, to the children of America, that it just makes sense that we are back here again trying to make sure that people across America understand the importance of providing health care for children across America. 
   I was sitting and smiling as you were talking about your children, or someone having a child and they go to day care and they come back home and the next day they are ill. The germs just keep floating around and around. If you have children that don't have access to health care, you present a real problem for other children in day care, and for yourself as well. 
   It is a problem that not only will greet those who vote against this legislation in 2007 and 2008, but they will look back on these young people who are now 4, 5, 6, 10 years old, in 10 years these children will say, well, where were you when I needed some health care? Now that I am old enough to vote, I remember back in 2007 when you voted not to support children's health care across America. I remember. I might have been a better athlete. I might have been a better student. I might have been able to go to medical school. Instead, because I wasn't able to have the appropriate health care, I wasn't able to pay attention to what is going on in class, I wasn't able to have the appropriate dental care, I am doing X. 
   So it will not only resound throughout America in 2007 on October 18 when we vote to override the President's veto; it will resound for years and years to come. 
   You know what the wonderful thing I have to say to Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek is? That today I have been going around the floor of the House talking to some of my colleagues who voted to support the SCHIP bill several weeks ago and asking them are they going to hold up their vote; are they going to vote with us when the time comes up on October 18. And I haven't run into anybody yet, except for one who has got an issue about something else, that said they won't be with us again on October 18 when it is time to override the President's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   This program has been so valuable. It has been so useful. It has been a hallmark for children, 6 million children in the United States of America; and it is time for us to extend it to another 4 million and to every child in these United States who needs to have great health care, some of the greatest health care that is given to all the rest of the people. 
   The funny thing is, I happened to be over in the United Arab Emirates, and I was seated at the table of one of the higher-ups of this country, and he said, you know, my father just came back from Cleveland getting health care services. I said, he did? And I got the information. 
   I am not mad at him. He can come here, we have the greatest health care in the world, and he can get it. But how is it that children right here in America can't get that same health care? That is the problem, and we got to fix it.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Yesterday, again, we had an opportunity to have this discussion. The interesting thing is that we are not alone in the position that we have taken about SCHIP. We are not alone, because newspapers across this country, across the country the newspapers have said that this President is wrong. 
   The Washington Post: ``Children's Health Check.'' 
   The Austin American Statesman: ``For many kids, the doctor is not in.'' 
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: ``Kids lose out to politics.'' 
   The Chicago Tribune: ``A sound children's health bill,'' talking about SCHIP.  
   The New York Times: ``Overcoming a veto and helping children.'' 
   The Daily News: ``Presidential malpractice,'' the veto on SCHIP is ``Presidential malpractice.'' 
   The Sacramento Bee: ``The SCHIPs are down.'' 
   The Akron Beacon Journal: ``SCHIP at the brink.'' 
   The USA Today: ``Plan to protect kids' health spawns needless veto fight.'' 
   The Charlotte Observer: ``Vote for healthy kids.'' 
   The Des Moines Register: ``Don't abandon kids needing health care.'' 
   Charleston Gazette: ``Child health--override the President.'' 
   The Houston Chronicle: ``Wrong priorities--Presidential veto of SCHIP expansion would place ideology over children's health.'' 
   The Republican: ``Bush abandons kids on health insurance.'' 
   And the Connecticut Post: ``Insurance change to help children.'' 
   Do you know what I heard the President say today? ``I am willing to negotiate.'' 
   Mr. President, don't negotiate with our children. Give them health care. Forget the negotiation, forget the political stuff you're trying to do on SCHIP, and all your Republican and Democratic colleagues in the House. Override the veto.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Then the President says, if the gentleman will yield, that everybody in America can get health care because they can go to the emergency room. Could you imagine if the 4 million children who don't have any health care coverage lined up in emergency rooms all across America, what a dilemma we would be in. It's just outrageous. 
   Mr. Speaker, the other important thing we have to think about is the fact that when families have children who are sick in them, that means parents have to stay off work, that means they aren't able to function or pay attention on the job, that means they are dysfunctional at their job if they go there because they are going to have to leave and pick up their children. I mean, it goes on and on and on. 
   Health care for children is good for America, it's good for American business, it's good for American families. George Bush needs a wake-up call.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Lest you think it is only Democrats saying SCHIP is a good bill, let me read the statements of some of my Republican colleagues. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas said: ``The administration is threatening to veto this bill because of `excessive spending' and their belief that this bill is a step towards federalization of health care. I am not for excessive spending and strongly oppose the federalization of health care, and if the administration's concerns with this bill were accurate, I would support a veto. But bluntly put, they are not.'' That is Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.  
   Jim Ramstad of Minnesota said: ``We have a moral obligation to cover all our children so every child in America can grow up healthy. It is the right thing to do. It is also the cost-effective thing to do, and that is why I strongly support extending and expanding SCHIP. I also hope we can work together to provide greater access to private insurance coverage for America's children and other uninsured Americans. There is no better investment than to invest in the health and well-being of America's children.'' That is Jim Ramstad. 
   Mr. Regula, one of the senior Members in the House of Representatives said: ``I voted today with the majority of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to extend SCHIP to expand health care access to the children of working parents whose income is too high to qualify for Medicaid but who, for one reason or another, do not have any health insurance coverage through their employers. The program has proven to be extremely successful in covering many children who have fallen through the cracks and providing them with quality preventive and acute health care. This bill provides States with new tools to enroll more eligible low-income children with health care coverage.'' That's Ralph Regula of Ohio.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. And the crazy thing about that statement is that if you talk to senior Americans across this country and you ask them about Medicare, they will say that Medicare is one of the finest systems of delivery of health care in this country, and they are so happy that we have Medicare and that the cost of running Medicare is equal to the cost that people pay, that it is a well-run program. So, even if we were talking about government-run health care, which we are not, let's talk about how great a program Medicare and Medicaid have been. 
   So I just want to close out, as I leave the two of you with the last few minutes of this, I'm calling upon everybody who can hear what I'm saying, and if you can't hear me and you're reading my lips or there's a script going under your TV, call your congressperson. Ask them, are you supporting SCHIP? If they are not, ask them why. Call your neighbor; ask your neighbor to call your congressperson. 
   This is down to a battle, and the battle is either for the children or against the children, and we're for the children.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure this evening to have an opportunity to stand in the well of this wonderful House of Representatives on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and our Chair, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick. 
   This evening I will be joined by several of my colleagues to talk about the black community, the African American community, and the economy and the impact that this downturn in the economy has had on the African American community. 
   Before I go to that subject matter, I just want to take a moment. One of the things that we have an opportunity, as Members of Congress, to do is to travel all around the United States, meeting people who say, oh, we watch you on television, we've seen you on television. And the fact is this weekend I had the opportunity to be in Orlando, Florida, on behalf of my sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. And I met one of the finest families in Orlando, headed by Janet McDowell-Travis and her husband, Michael Travis, son Jordan, who is 10 years old, who drew me this really, really nice card, Janet's mother, Vergnoustene, my soror as well, and Janet's aunt, Aunt Romelda. So, I just want to take a moment this evening, Mr. Speaker, to have an opportunity to  say hello to that McDowell-Travis family and say to them, thank you so much for making my weekend in Orlando so great. And hopefully I'll have another chance to see you in July, when I come back to Florida for our national convention. Hi, everybody. Hope you're doing well. 
   Back to the reason that I'm here on floor to talk about the Congressional Black Caucus message hour, the declining economy and its impact on the African American community.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, let me begin by seeking unanimous consent that my colleagues have 5 days in which to revise and extend their remarks, to allow other Members to have the opportunity to submit their remarks in writing. In fact, I have in my hand a signed statement by my colleague and good friend from the great State of Texas, Eddie Bernice Johnson, which I will choose to submit for the Record.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Let me begin with a quote. ``At the bottom of education, at the bottom of politics, even at the bottom of religion, there must be economic independence.'' Booker T. Washington from 1903. These words, spoken more than a century ago by one of our foremost African American thinkers and educators, perhaps might be more relevant today than they were in 1903. 
   For far too long, the current administration has danced around this issue, hoping that it would go away. But it is time that we state the truth. Our economy is in decline. Today, hardworking African American families are struggling to make ends meet in this slowing economy. Wages are flat, prices are high, and for many, jobs are hard to come by. 
   These problems are even greater in the African American community. Unemployment rates for African Americans are consistently almost double for white Americans. The median family earnings of full-time African American workers is consistently over $130 less than white workers who are similarly educated and situated. 
   The poverty rate for African Americans is almost double the national poverty rate, 24 percent versus 12.5 percent. And more than triple, 33 percent versus 9.8 percent, for children under the age of 18. 
   Home ownership for African Americans is 48 percent compared to 72 percent for white Americans. And African Americans are more than two times more likely to have been denied a mortgage, and more than two times more likely to receive predatory loans. 
   In this most recent research around foreclosures, it has been shown that African Americans who, in fact, qualified for prime mortgages were, in fact, steered to subprime mortgages, predatory loans because the advantage for the lender was greater, they could make more money on the predatory subprime loan than they could on a prime loan. 
   Minority-owned businesses received only 57 cents of each dollar they would be expected to receive based on the percentage of ``ready, willing and able'' businesses that are minority owned. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus remains committed to economic empowerment in the African American community. This includes, but it is not limited to: 
   One, eradicated employment discrimination and ensuring the employment of a diverse workforce by employers in the private sector and in government, including staff of committees and Members of Congress. 
   Two, protecting the rights and working conditions of all employees. 
   Three, providing support to enable people to work, such as child care, transportation, health care, job retraining and a living wage. 
   Four, promoting the advancement of African Americans into management, executive and director positions. 
   Five, providing equal access to capital for individuals and businesses, and the elimination of redlining and predatory lending practices. 
   Six, expanding affordable rental and ownership of housing. 
   Seven, achieving aggressive minority business goals and participation in government and private contracting. 
   So, tonight you will hear from various members of the Congressional Black Caucus as we discuss the many economic problems facing the African American community, as well as our plans to address those issues. 
   If I can go back to my experience in Orlando this weekend. I had an opportunity to participate in this wonderful ceremony involving 10 young African American men and women that were juniors and seniors in high 
   school. And the experiences and backgrounds of these young men and women were just fantastic. And one of the things I reminded them of was, no deposit, no return. I talked to them about, we used the expression, birds of a feather flock together, and that eagles do not fly with sparrows. And I suggested to them that they needed to be eagles so that they could fly far above and do more. But even in the midst of all of flying higher, doing more, in an economy like we are experiencing today it would be difficult for these young men and women to be successful. 
   So, I'm going to take a break for a moment and yield to my colleague and good friend from the great State of California, the honorable gentlewoman from California, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, such time as she may consume.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for her leadership, and hope that she will decide to hang around a little while with me as we go through a few more issues. If you can't, I absolutely understand. 
   I want to go back to the housing crisis for a moment. The loss of a home is both devastating for the family and the community. For a family, owning a home is often their only piece of the ``American Pie.'' The equity from owning their home is often the only means to secure funding for a new business, college tuition or retirement. For the community, increased foreclosures often turn neighborhoods that once were vibrant into neglected, blighted areas which ultimately raise costs for local governments. 
   In the State of Ohio alone, 90,000 homes are in foreclosure. In fact, one of the things that we often talk about is that working class families usually pass their biggest asset from 1 generation to the next, and that is a house. So not only are we devastating the income and wealth of this generation, we may well be devastating the income and wealth of future generations. 
   Predatory lending is the leading cause of the foreclosures across this country. And I need not go on and on about the issue, but let me just point out a few statistics. 
   The Nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending projects that as this year ends, 2.2 million households in the subprime market will either have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold subprime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. The real dilemma that many of the families face is the amount of mortgage that they own on the home far exceeds the real value of the home. 
   Additionally, only about 1.4 million of 15.1 million loans analyzed from 1998 through 2006 were for first-time home buyers. Most were refinancing. And all of us got those calls from people calling up, Mrs. Jones, you have a unique opportunity right in your community to refinance your home, and this program is just for your neighborhood. And a lot of people got fooled by those calls. To date, more than 500,000 of those subprime borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure. An additional 1.8 million are likely to follow as the market deteriorates. That's nearly 2.4 million lost homes. 
   And predatory lending has expanded its reach beyond mortgage lending. Predatory practices are becoming increasingly prevalent in refund anticipation, auto and payday loans. There were over 12 million Refund Anticipation Loan borrowers in 2003. In other words, anticipating what your income tax checks would be, people borrowed on those tax checks. 
   Tax preparers and lenders strip about $1.57 billion in fees each year from the earned income tax credits paid to working parents, according to the 2005 study by the National Consumer Law Center. 
   And imagine what the new programs are going to be as we come up with these rebates that the President has proposed for working families in order for us to shore up Wal-Mart or Target or one of these other stores. In fact, I think it is pretty scary that we are now going to try and shore up the economy by taking the money of people who have worked hard for it. 
   I bet that many people are going to pay attention; they're not going to stick it back in the economy. They, in fact, may in fact put it in a savings account or try to make some money on behalf of their families, or pay off an existing debt. 
   In December, the Congress enacted the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act which, for 3 years, stops the tax on phantom income when a lender forgives some part of the family's mortgage in foreclosure. Under prior law, the debt forgiven following mortgage foreclosure or renegotiation was considered  income for tax purposes, resulting in a tax liability for individuals and families meaning, at a time when people were down and out, they were then required to pay tax on something that was forgiven by a lender. It was crazy, and thank God this whole Congress understood the impact, and we passed that legislation. 
   In December, the Congress included $180 million for housing counseling in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill to assist many distressed homeowners who are trapped in unaffordable loans in avoiding 
   foreclosure on their homes. 
   The Economic Stimulus Bill, which the President will sign this week, increases the FHA loan limits up to $729,750 to expand affordable mortgage loan opportunities through the FHA for families in danger of losing their homes. This was done because in areas like the area in which Congresswoman Barbara Lee lives in, housing, middle income housing costs as much as $800,000 to $1 million. In Cleveland, an $800,000 home would buy you a lot of house, but not California. 
   Both the House and Senate have passed an FHA reform bill which would enable FHA to serve more subprime borrowers at affordable rates and terms to attract borrowers that have been turned to predatory lenders in recent years. 
   The House has passed a mortgage lending reform bill which cracks down on predatory lending, making sure that consumers get mortgages they can repay, strengthening consumer protections against reckless and abusive lending practices, and giving consumers the ability to seek redress. 
   I have to say that in 2001 I introduced the Predatory Lending Reduction Act, and this act was focused on mortgage brokers. And the reason I focused on mortgage brokers was because mortgage brokers were not licensed, they were not required to be registered. They were not required to give notice to a purchaser or a borrower that they were not representing that borrower; they weren't their agent. They were not required to tell the borrower that they were going to get a percentage or a commission on the loans that they made. So you had a lot of mortgage brokers operating out here without any licensing, without any registration, without being required to give notices to, like banking persons, to borrowers. So it was very important for us, and that was included in the Mortgage Lending Reform Act, number 3915. 
   In October, the House passed the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Bill, 2895, which establishes a trust fund, at no cost to the taxpayer, to build or preserve 1.5 million affordable homes or apartments over the next 10 years. The trust fund is financed by fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and by increased FHA loans. 
   The fact is that we have needed a national affordable housing trust fund for many, many years and finally, in 2007, 2008, we have one that's available. 
   At this time, if my colleague is interested, I'd like to yield to her for some additional commentary, Congresswoman Barbara Lee.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I'd like to thank my colleague. There are just a few more things that I'd like to point out and point to, and if there is another person coming behind me with some, a special order, I would suggest that we should probably be finished in about 15 minutes. 
   I, first of all, would like to focus in on some of the legislation I've been working on around wealth building, because one of the most difficult things for families in the downturn of an economy is to try and put aside savings. And one of the things that we see happening right now in our country are a number of companies that are closing down, and people are placed in a situation where they are now being required to retire and they're being given lump sum benefits in order to lessen the weight or the impact that the retirement has on them. 
   And as a proponent of wealth building, I've been working on a couple of pieces of legislation in that area. One of them is the Retirement Security for Life Act. 
   Last year I, along with Congressman Philip English, a Republican from Pennsylvania, reintroduced the bipartisan tax legislation that would encourage Americans to select life annuities and ensure requirement security. The Retirement Security for Life Act provides a tax incentive available to all retirees when they elect to receive a guaranteed stream of income for life from their annuity. The bill will exclude Federal taxes on half of the income generated by the annuity, up to a maximum of $20,000 annually. For the typical retiree, it would provide a tax break of up to $5,000. 
   The bill is designed to help Americans who have savings maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. Research indicates that many future retirees, including an estimated 77 million baby boomers, will have difficulty maintaining an adequate standard of living. By providing incentives, the Retirement for Security for Life Act will encourage Americans to invest in their own retirement.     
   The periodic payments from a life annuity would guarantee income throughout retirement as a complement to Social Security and pension benefits. A life annuity provides beneficiaries with guaranteed lifelong monthly payments. After-tax dollars, such as the proceeds from the sale of a house or small business, can be used to purchase the annuity. Income from employers' sponsored plans that already enjoy a tax advantage, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, are not eligible. This bipartisan legislation encourages Americans to select lifetime annuity payments, thereby generating a steady income for life and helping them manage their savings. 
   One of the limits that happens when people receive a lump sum is it seems like a lot of money at the time when you receive it, but it very easily wanes away by the time you lend your cousin $2,000, your son $5,000, your aunt or uncle a couple of dollars, and that $50,000 is gone very quickly. And that is one of the reasons that I'm encouraging our Retirement for Security for Life Act. 
   Another piece of legislation is called Savings for Working Families Act. This legislation was introduced, and it's H.R. 1514. It provides a tax credit to financial institutions that match the savings of low-income families through individual development accounts, or IDAs. The individual savings in an IDA are matched on a one-to-one basis, up to $500 per person per year; although, personal contributions into an IDA are not limited. The match only goes up to $500. It is a unique way and a great way that we could have low-income families begin to understand the importance of saving and receive a match for their dollars. 
   Thousands of working families across the country currently take advantage of IDA matched savings and asset accumulation. They are run by community-based organizations in partnership with a qualified financial institution that holds the deposits. IDA funds can be used for college and post-secondary education, purchasing a home or starting a small business. Those who save in IDAs also receive financial planning  education. Nationally, 500,000 Americans are presently enrolled in 500 IDA programs. In the State of Ohio, nearly 5,000 benefit from 15 IDA programs. 
   The goal of the Savings for Working Families Act is to encourage low-income families to save. 
   Cleveland's Save program, which is a program in the City of Cleveland where I live, is a national social marketing campaign that encourages individuals, particularly low and moderate income, to save. It was launched in 2001 in the City of Cleveland. America Saves now has 53 local and State national campaigns which include locations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Diego, California; and New York State. More than 1,000 nonprofit organizations participate. They recently celebrated American Saves Week, which is a new and expanded effort which is aimed at reaching more institutions. 
   Let me now give any further time to my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Barbara Lee.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I want to associate myself with the comments of my colleague with regard to ending the war in Iraq and the devastation that it has had not only on more than 4,000 families but as well as the economy of America and the infrastructure of America. All you need to do is pick up a paper any day and see that in any city there is a bridge that's fallen down, there's a sewer that's blowing up, there's streets that are in trouble, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I want to close on this particular note. 
   It is so important to the improvement of this economy and the status of America that we make sure there are good-paying jobs that come back to America. I keep hearing these discussions about, well, there are jobs, and there are not people in America who want to do these jobs. That is not correct. There are good, hardworking people. The people of America work harder than people in any other country. They have less vacation, less time off, and they work very, very hard. 
   The dilemma that's faced is the offering of jobs that do not pay good salaries; that do not, in fact, provide appropriate benefits. And the people of America are going to want go to work, and the innovation agenda that was passed last fall in this Congress and signed into law by the President speaks to some of those issues. 
   And it is so important that we do things to improve the education of our young people so they are better qualified to work on jobs, and that was done through the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2008. 
   It is also important that we encourage young men and women to go into the sciences. The statistics show that, in 2000, only 4 percent of the science and engineering jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Nearly 40 percent of Americans under the age of 18 are African Americans or other minorities. So we need to do more and more and more to encourage young people to go to college to be able to get the kind of degrees where they can get a great job such as we talked about with the children in Orlando in the Eminence Program. 
   And finally, we need to support and strengthen small businesses. Two-thirds of American jobs are supported, are given by small business, and we need to encourage small business to continue. 
   African Americans own an estimated 1.2 billion small businesses with annual revenues of more than $88 billion. Legislation enacted in 2007 included provisions cutting taxes for small business by $4 billion over the next 10 years. And the economic stimulus package also speaks to those issues as well. 
   I want to close with this. The Congressional Black Caucus is tirelessly working on issues that are important to the African American community but as to the greater community as well, and the economy is the issue that's in the forefront of everybody's mind right now, regardless of their color, regardless of their background. And this evening, it was our job to point out to America, those of you listening here on C-SPAN, to the issues that are facing the African American community and the economy and to help people understand that, if it hits the greater community in one way, it doubly impacts the African American community. 
   And on behalf of my colleagues at the Congressional Black Caucus and our Chairwoman, Carolyn C. Kilpatrick, I'm pleased to close this message hour out and thank the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, for the opportunity to present.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. This legislation prevents the pending 10-percent payment reduction for physicians in Medicare, enhances Medicare preventive and mental health benefits, improves and extends programs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and extends expiring provisions for rural and other providers. 
   While I do have some concerns regarding the lack of protections for African American end stage renal disease patients, I am encouraged by many of the provisions included in this legislation. I am particularly pleased that the bill extends and improves low-income assistance programs for Medicare whose income is below $14,040.00 including the qualified individual program that pays part B premiums for low-income beneficiaries. Additionally, the bill adds new preventative benefits to the Medicare program and reduces out of pocket expenses for mental health care. 
   Specifically, provisions of the legislation include modest steps to reduce Medicare payments to private plans that receive more than 100 percent of the cost to treat a beneficiary in fee-for-service Medicare. The legislation would accomplish this by phasing out the Indirect Medical Education double-payment, eliminating the Medicare ``slush'' fund to further increase payments to private plans, and ensuring that Private Fee-for-Service, PFFS, plans comply with quality requirements and have adequate access to providers. 
   Additionally, the legislation provides assistance to physicians and pharmacies including eliminating the pending 10-percent cut in Medicare payments to physicians through 2008, a 1.1 percent update in Medicare physician payments for 2009, and requires Medicare Advantage plans to pay pharmacies promptly within a 14-day period.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and our Chair, CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK, I'm pleased to anchor this Congressional Black Caucus message hour today. 
   Let me commend all of the original cosponsors on this piece of legislation; the lead sponsor, DANNY DAVIS, who's joining me this evening in this Special Order; cosponsors STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, JOHN CONYERS, ELIJAH CUMMINGS, SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, BOBBY SCOTT, HANK JOHNSON, BARBARA LEE, MAXINE WATERS, and the list goes on. The majority of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus are signatories to this very, very important piece of legislation. 
   The purpose of the Second Chance Act is to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and help States and communities to better address the growing population of prisoners returning to communities. The bill will focus on four areas: jobs, housing, substance abuse, mental health treatment and families. 
   Nearly two-thirds of released State prisoners are expected to be arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years of their release. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year and wasted taxpayer dollars, which can be averted through improved prisoner re-entry efforts. 
   The Second Chance Act of 2007 allocates $360 million towards a variety of re-entry programs. One of the main components of the bill is the funding of demonstration projects that will provide ex-offenders with a coordinated continuum of housing, education, health, employment, and mentoring services. This broad array of services will provide stability and make the transition for ex-offenders easier, in turn, reducing recidivism. 
   I sat here this evening, Mr. Speaker, and enjoyed the speeches by many of my colleagues talking about National Bible Month. I am so pleased that they chose that subject matter, and I hope that the many Members that spoke this evening about the Bible and where it specifically says ``when I was in prison you visited me,'' they will remember that their good talk and great conversation about the Bible apply to ex-offenders and that they will support the Second Chance Act. 
   It gives me great pleasure at this time to yield to my colleague and good friend, SHEILA JACKSON-LEE of Texas.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Prisoner re-entry is not a democratic issue. It's not  a Republican issue. It is a commonsense issue. The facts are clear. Meaningful re-entry programs significantly diminish the chances that ex-offenders will return to prison.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you. 
   Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I have been waiting 30 years for Congress to enact meaningful reentry legislation, as I have been deeply involved in prison reentry programs since my days as a municipal court judge, common plea judge, and county prosecutor in Cleveland. While prosecutor, I helped to establish the Pretrial Diversion program, as well as the Municipal Drug Court program. And I am so happy to be able to say that it's my understanding that the drug court program in Cleveland is going to move from the municipal court to expand to the common pleas court so it is county-wide. Both programs, I'm proud to say, still exist and continue to help ex-offenders move on with their lives and become productive citizens. 
   The State of Ohio has one of the largest populations of ex-offenders reentering the community, with about 24,000 ex-offenders returning to their respective communities annually. Of those ex-offenders, about 6,000 will return to Cuyahoga County, my county, and almost 5,000 will reenter in the City of Cleveland. Statewide about 40 percent of ex-offenders will return to prison. In Cuyahoga County about 41 percent will return. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year and wasted taxpayer dollars. 
   Today I am proud to stand with my colleague Danny Davis as an original cosponsor of the Second Chance Act of 2007. This legislation is forward-thinking. It provides opportunities for all the Members of Congress who sincerely believe in helping their brother or their sister in times of need to support this legislation. 
   It gives me great pleasure to yield to the lead sponsor of the Second Chance Act, Danny Davis of Illinois, and say to him, Danny, thank you for your leadership on this issue. I'm proud to join with you around the work that we have been doing on behalf of ex-offenders across the Nation.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. And if the gentlemen would yield, that legislation prohibits offenders who have drug convictions from getting student loans. So if they wanted to go back to school and change their lives, we've got legislation that prohibits them from having the opportunity to go back to college.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I want to highlight, if I might, just a couple of programs in the City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, that have been successful in community re-entry. 
   I have served on the board of the Community Re-Entry Program under the Lutheran Metropolitan Ministries for some 25 years. I remember with great glee Rev. Dick Searing, who has gone on to shine down upon us as we continue his work, as well as Charles See, who is the executive director, and a lot of the members that were on the board. We were able, through Community Re-Entry, to do a number of things, and one of those was to develop care teams, and the care teams were made of ex-offenders. And we developed these care teams such that at one point in time they were literally serving as caretakers or workers for senior citizens staying in public housing. 
   One of the senior citizens actually said that she viewed the, we called them ``care team members,'' and they wore red jackets, and she stated how she felt about them. And she said, ``They're not criminals. They're just like my sons. And they've been taking care of me.'' 
   The care teams were paid employees of Community Re-Entry. They received a full-time benefit package, including vacation, health insurance and pension that was fully vested after 1 year. The recidivism rate for our care team members was less than 5 percent. 
   We also had a program under Community Re-Entry called Friend to Friend. The Friend to Friend program recruited, trained and coordinated volunteers to visit men and women in prison. Male volunteers are matched with men at Lorain Correctional and Grafton Prison located in Lorain County Ohio, and females were matched with women at the Pre-Release Center in Cleveland. The purpose of the program is to reduce socialization of people who are incarcerated and help them prepare for re-entry into the community. Because one of the dilemmas is that sometimes the penal institution is so far away from the family background, that they have a family home that they have no way of going to visit. Also, it is said that an inmate in prison is more likely to successfully re-enter if he has a support base around him when he or she returns home. 
   Another wonderful program that we had was we started a catering service that was run by ex-offenders who prepared boxed lunches, and we were able to serve many of the downtown businesses who did box lunches. We also had a painting company, and we were able to paint many of the different houses across the county. 
   What I would really just want to say in concluding this is that this is a unique opportunity for this Congress to step up and support a program that truly has been successful across the country. Community entry means that we will say to ex-offenders in this Nation, if you have done your time, then you have paid your commitment to the United States, the State of Ohio, whatever State you come from, and we now want to help you come back to be a productive citizen in the United States of America; paying taxes, raising families, paying child support, and really helping to make our community a better place. 
   I am so pleased to have an opportunity, and I said, I've been waiting 30 years for the Federal Congress to come back and do what they need to do with regard to community re-entry. 
   I thank all of my colleagues and friends for the opportunity. And I'm going to say it one more time, if we are truly going to celebrate the Bible, and my grandfather was a minister, I'm a student of the Bible, and I can name Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and go down the list, but I will say to you, the best thing that we can do is to take care of one another.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank my chairman for giving me this opportunity to be heard. 
   You know, my friend from New York, I tried to feel what he was saying to me. And it was emotional and everything, but it did not speak to the issue that we're talking about. 
   I went to law school, and I wanted to be a civil rights lawyer. I thought that if I was a great civil rights lawyer, I could really help the people of America, the people that live in my community. But I should have been a tax lawyer, because had I been a tax lawyer, then I would have better understood how I could help middle-class families by fixing the AMT. If I had been a tax lawyer, I would have understood how I could help people purchase homes and get a benefit from it. Had I been a tax lawyer, I would have understood how fairness operates in the United States of America through the Tax Code, because by the Tax Code, poor people might have a chance, working people might have a chance. 
   I say to my colleagues today, vote for this, vote for this bill. It may not be all that we wanted. And if you think about it, if we hadn't spent so many trillions of dollars in Iraq, maybe there would be a pay-for in this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that today, the House is taking up tax relief for the 23 million Americans who otherwise would be saddled with the onerous alternative minimum tax. In addition, we are also providing relief for 7.4 million low-income workers by increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
   Families across America will this weekend sit down at the dinner table take an accounting of their personal finances and balance their checkbook. The Government is charged with balancing the checkbook of the United States. While I enthusiastically support the efforts of private equity and hedge fund managers, I am very aware that service income is just that and should be taxed that way--at ordinary income rates. It is the responsible thing to do because we must not mortgage our future by continuing to borrow from foreign countries such as China. 
   We are also, Mr. Speaker, enabling more than 6.5 million working families to use the refundable Child Tax Credit. This is allowing more families to remove themselves from the depths of poverty. This legislation is helping Americans help themselves. It is okay to ask people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but if they don't have boots, we are asking too much. H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act is sound legislation, progressive tax policy and the right direction for America. 
   When a member of Congress hails from one of the poorest congressional districts in America as I do, there is a special responsibility to ensure that the interests of constituents are being addressed. That is why I am pleased to see that while we are pursuing a patch for the AMT, we are also increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for an additional 7.4 million low-income workers. 
   The alternative minimum tax is an important issue for the American middle class taxpayer who does not get to take advantage of sophisticated tax planning and legal loopholes in the tax code. It is time that we addressed this issue once and for all to relieve the American taxpayer from the agony and pain that arise from having to figure out their taxes twice in order to come up with their tax liability. 
   It is particularly ironic that a tax that was meant for a few wealthy individuals has become the bane of existence for millions of American taxpayers, who could be affected. Indeed the AMT has become a menace. Over 7,000 hardworking Ohioans in my district had the grim task of filing a return with AMT implications in the 2005 tax year. Those are families with children, healthcare costs, unemployment issues, housing costs and the other money matters with which American taxpayers must cope. Relief is due. 
   We should consider alternatives to this alternative that might include a complete repeal. Relief is due. ``Taxes are what we pay to live in civilized society,'' but dealing with the AMT has become a bit uncivil. 
   On the one hand we have people that have to live paycheck-to-paycheck and on the other hand we have partners in partnerships, whether they be real estate or private equity who sippeth from the public trough. I am cognizant that many of these partners work diligently to bring companies to market and to grease the wheels of capitalism from which we all benefit, from East Cleveland to East L.A. to East Harlem. As I mentioned after the introduction of Representative LEVIN's H.R. 2834, we must applaud the efforts of American capitalists and the strides that they make in fostering growth in our economy and, the global economy to wit. Yet we must also tax compensation income as compensation income and capital gains thusly. 
   We must also be mindful of the effect that our tax policy has on potential reinvestment in low-income and minority communities. It is important to note that women and minorities are often the last to the table and just when they are getting ready to participate in the large-scale ``financial festival'' that is private equity and hedge funds, etc, the rules appear to be changing. It is incumbent upon members of the aforementioned parties that fair and equitable tax policy should not be confused with the opening up of capital markets and the extension of new opportunity. 
   The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notions of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on that traditional framework I am sure that we have come to a rational consensus.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. There is a piece of poetry that starts like this, ``I'd rather see a sermon than to hear one any day, I'd rather one should walk with me than just to show the way. 
   ``The eye is a better pupil and more willing than the ear; Advice may be misleading, but examples are always clear. And the very best of teachers are the ones who live their creeds.'' 
   It goes on to talk about how you can deliver lectures, but I would rather get a lesson by observing what you do. 
   I am saying to my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, the children of America are listening to us gibe at one another about whether they deserve health care. They deserve health care, and we could give it to them today. 
   They deserve health care because many of them are spending so many hours in an emergency room, costly, many of them are spending times at home when they could be educated. Many parents are not at work because they are staying home with their children. Health care should be a right in America, and our children are saying they would rather see a sermon than to hear one. They want us to walk and give them health care and stop talking about it.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I wish to submit a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, dated October 25, 2007, to Speaker Pelosi. And it specifically says under current law individuals who apply for Medicaid and claim to be U.S. citizens are required to provide certain documents, passport or birth certificate, in order to receive any such health care. 
   ``Section 211 would allow States the option to either use the requirements created in the DRA for citizenship documentation under Medicaid or instead verify an individual's name and Social Security number with the Social Security Administration. Some States have reported a drop in enrollment since implementation of the DRA because some Medicaid applicants have had difficulty satisfying the documentation requirement. Available evidence, based on State reports and other information provided by State officials, suggests that virtually all of those who have been unable to provide the required documentation are U.S. citizens.''

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand on behalf of the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives this afternoon to say we are going to pass a prescription drug change in the benefit given to seniors last year. And it is not going to take us 3 hours and any arm twisting, because this is our opportunity to say to seniors across this country that you ought to have your Secretary of Health and Human Services be able to negotiate the lowest price. 
   Right now it is going great, but we need to put in place in the law an opportunity for the Secretary to make a change when the winds of time change, because they will change. It is important that our seniors understand that they do have a benefit, but the benefit can be improved. 
   It is always interesting to me that they dump on the Veterans' Administration when they want to tout it all the time as not a good health care plan. If it ain't a good health care plan for the veterans, change it. Make it better for the veterans. They are over there fighting and losing their lives. 
   A prescription drug benefit is such a significant opportunity for our seniors, and so I am glad to stand on behalf of all the Democrats and those good-thinking Republicans in the House of Representatives. Pass H.R. 4.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4, which will require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate for lower drug prices for people enrolled in Medicare prescription drug plans. 
   As drug prices soar, this issue is becoming more important for Medicare recipients and their families. 
   According to a recent AARP study, between 2002 and 2005, prices for the most widely used brand-name prescription drugs increased an average of 6.6 percent per year. 
   That is more than twice the 2.5 percent average inflation rate for that same period of time. 
   It is not fair to expect American families to keep paying such price increases for their prescription drugs. 
   In my home state of Ohio, we have about 1.8 million Medicare beneficiaries who stand to benefit from the lower prices that could result if the Secretary of HHS is given the power to negotiate. 
   Of those 1.8 million Ohioans, 625,000 are already enrolled in Part D and would immediately see the benefits of lower drug prices. 
   Congress should no longer stand in the way. 
   We need to require the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug prices and soften the health and economic burden that millions of American families currently experience. 
   This would not be anything new. 
   Right now, government-funded health programs, such as Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs, are able to negotiate with drug companies and reach agreements that offer their participants low drug prices while still rewarding drug companies for the valuable research they conduct. 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, the VA achieves savings of between 30 and 50 percent for their patients through negotiation. 
   This same level of saving can also be achieved for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Moreover, the result of not allowing the HHS Secretary to negotiate lower drug prices puts a disproportionate burden on senior citizens and retirees, who are those that need affordable drugs the most. 
   Drug companies deserve applause for the advances they have made for the good of all people, but we also owe it to the American people to ensure they receive the medication they need at a fair price. 
   With rising health care, housing, and energy costs, a decrease in drug prices would go a long way to helping middle class Americans meet their needs. 
   Support H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mrs. JONES of Ohio. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This legislation will help break down the barriers, particularly the ever-rising costs of higher education, for Americans to obtain a college degree. 
   I am extremely excited about the provision from my legislation, the Campus Fire Safety and Prevention Act, that is included in this bill. This legislation would establish a demonstration incentive program within the Department of Education to promote installation of fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or prevention technologies, in qualified student housing or dormitories, and for other purposes. 
   Fire safety and prevention is an issue that needs to be addressed across this country. Over these few years we have seen many tragedies involving fire at colleges, places of business, entertainment venues and places of residence. 
   Nationwide, 126 people have been killed in student housing since January 2000, as identified by the Center for Campus Fire Safety, a non-profit organization that compiles information on campus-related fires. 
   Almost 83 percent of the fire fatalities have occurred in off-campus occupancies such as rented houses and apartments. Common factors in a number of these fires include: lack of automatic sprinklers, disabled smoke alarms, careless disposal of smoking materials, and alcohol consumption. 
   We must begin to put in place suppression measures against fires and increase support and resources for our fire fighters to ensure that no more lives are lost to fires that could have been prevented. 
   I encourage my colleagues to pass the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This legislation would reform our higher education system so that it operates in the best interests of students and families.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007, as reported by the Education and Labor Committee under the able leadership of the gentlemen from California, Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MCKEON.   
   I want to commend the chairman specifically for including in the bill a provision requiring the Government Accountability Office to examine the impact that law school accreditation requirements and other factors have on the costs of law school and student access to law school, including the impact of such requirements on racial and ethnic minorities. I would also like to thank my colleague Representative BOBBY SCOTT for his efforts to have this amendment included. 
   This provision is important and timely in light of a 15 year decline in minority law school enrollment documented by a Columbia Law School web site created in conjunction with the Society of American Law Teachers. As described in the National Law Journal and other publications, the site uses 12 graphs and nearly 200 data points to illustrate an 8.6 percent drop in law school enrollment among African American and Mexican American students between 1992 and 2006. This disturbing trend has occurred even while overall law school enrollment numbers have increased and admissibility indicators for minority applicants have improved. 
   in addition, 2007 statistics from the Law School Admissions Council suggest that high shutout rates may be discouraging African American and Mexican American students from applying to law school in the first place; data show that the number of African American and Mexican American applicants has fallen significantly since 2004. 
   One certain factor in the trend is the over-reliance of law schools and accreditors on L.S.A.T. scores as an admissions criterion and I expect the GAO study to bear that out. 
   In the meantime, Madam Chairman, this trend threatens great harm to minority and disadvantaged communities throughout the United States where the consequences will include reduced access to quality legal services and less economic opportunity and empowerment. It is therefore critical that Congress understand and take active steps to counteract the various factors that have contributed to the decline. 
   Realizing the promise of ``equal justice under the law'' requires that we ensure equal opportunity to legal education for students who come from, and intend to serve, our Nation's neediest communities. Despite the remarkable progress that has been made, many obstacles to opportunity remain. We cannot stand idle as minority underrepresentation in the legal profession increases. 
   So, as we await the results of the GAO study, I respectfully urge my colleagues on the Education Committee to conduct hearings that will illuminate the problem, its causes, and expert recommendations for alleviating it. 
   In closing, I will insert into the RECORD the aforementioned articles. There are current efforts underway by members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses to formally request a hearing on this subject and to urge the ABA Section of Legal Education to adopt law school accreditation standards that are consistent with the goal of increasing minority representation in the legal profession. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   
   Minority Enrollment Is Faltering  
   A web site recently established by an elite law school paints a dismal picture of enrollment among certain minority groups in law schools generally--a picture that may well become still bleaker. 
   Enrollment of blacks and Mexican-Americans has fallen by 8.6% in the past 15 years, according to a Web site created by Columbia Law School and the Society of American Law Teachers (SALT). 
   The decline has occurred as applications to law schools among those two groups have remained constant and as law school enrollment overall has increased since 1992. 
   With law schools continuing to revere U.S. News & World Report rankings and with anti-affirmative action initiatives possibly being on the ballot in five states in November, it appears that the situation may only worsen. 
   ``It's not a pipeline problem,'' said Conrad Johnson, clinical professor of law at Columbia. Johnson and two law students working with the school's Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic helped create the Web site, along with SALT. He said that the statistics, compiled from information provided by the Law School Admission Council, dispute the notion that the low enrollment numbers among blacks and Mexican-Americans are due to dwindling applications from those groups.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a statement that says: ``To believe that God will do everything while you do nothing is not faith but superstition.'' We have an opportunity to do something, not to wait for God to do it. 
   But let me start where I was. On May 21, I buried my dad, a veteran of the Korean War. He died at age 87. As I stood before that flag-draped coffin, I thought about all the mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, children, nieces and nephews who have buried their loved ones as a result of this Iraqi war--3,600. I don't want to go to another funeral, I have been to five. Not another deployment, I have been to three. Not another memorial, I have been to six. 
   I want our soldiers to come home as soon as possible. We have an opportunity to do a deployment that makes sense, that fits within all that we can do as Members of Congress. Members of Congress, step up to the plate. Don't be afraid. Vote in favor of this redeployment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today the administration released its ``Assessment Report'' on Iraq. While attempting to tout ``progress,'' it is plain to see that this is more of the same rhetoric that has become so commonplace in this administration. The sad truth is that since President Bush launched this war, more than 3,600 American service men and women have been killed in Iraq, more than 26,000 have been injured, and the American taxpayer has spent nearly half a trillion dollars on this war. 
   The report highlights that the Iraqi government has not met a single one of the 18 security, political, and economic milestones that the Congress laid out as measurements for success. It also substantiates the fact that of the 18 benchmarks Congress laid out, Iraqis are making progress on only eight. The report also shows us that Iraqi security forces are not providing even-handed enforcement of the law and that Militia presence is still a prevalent force within the security services of a number of ministries. 
   It is for this reason that I am in support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. In addition to requiring the redeployment of American forces this legislation requires the development of a comprehensive strategy for U.S. policy in Iraq and limits missions any remaining forces in Iraq may undertake to duties such as counter-terrorism, and protecting American personnel at the embassy in Iraq. 
   It has been said that faith without action is merely superstition. We now have the opportunity to change course in this war. My father was a World War II veteran. He died a few months ago at the age of 87. As I looked at the flag draped across his coffin, I thought about the many mothers, fathers and families that had to bury their loved ones, many of them barely adults, and see that flag draped across their caskets. 
   I, along with the American people, have no more patience with regards to this war in Iraq. I've been to three deployments, five funerals and countless memorial services; I don't want to go to any more. I want to be able to go to one last homecoming celebration when we can bring an end to this war.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman for yielding time. I would like to thank the subcommittee Chair, MAXINE WATERS, for all her leadership and work on this; the Chair, Mr. Frank; and my old colleague from Ohio, Bob Ney for the work. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1851. In my district the problems with section 8 housing have bubbled to the surface, particularly in many of the inter-ring suburbs such as Bedford, Bedford Heights, Euclid, Cleveland Heights, and Shaker Heights. They have seen an increase in section 8 housing and are beginning to see a clash in culture between owners and renters, between those who have long time been owners and those who are new at renting property. 
   It is very important that when we start to look at some of the urban centers, some of the older housing, we start looking at the inter-ring suburbs with older housing, and even the newer suburban municipalities, that we have an opportunity to reform how we have section 8 housing and how it is used. The reform provisions in this bill will not only open access to low-income Americans to rent and even buy, it will provide incentives so that the program can truly serve its purpose of empowering people to become self-sufficient. 
   Certainly, as we have gone through this whole year or past 2 or 3 years where we have had predatory lenders preying upon our communities, we want to be able to give those new homeowners an opportunity to understand what homeownership means, to understand what kind of situation they could put themselves in without the necessary education. But as important to owning a home is the ability to have a decent job, to be well trained, to take care of your family, et cetera. And through the proposals that are set forth in this program, I believe we will have an opportunity to see that come to fruition. 
   This bill also includes a number of provisions designed to create other incentives. 
   I am so proud to have an opportunity to stand on the floor of the House saying that section 8 is going to be more than it has been in the past, that it will reach its true fruition.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I would like to thank my colleague, the gentleman, John Tanner, for yielding me time. I just came from a memorial service for one of our former colleagues from Ways and Means, Charlie Vanik. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of legislation calling on the President of the United States and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic. 
   For many years now we have seen the devastating atrocities taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan. With the support of the Sudanese Government, the janjaweed militia has ravaged the people of Darfur, raping, torturing, murdering, and forcing thousands of Darfuris to flee to refugee camps in neighboring Chad and the Central African Republic. Today, we highlight some of those most vulnerable of these victims in Darfur, women and girls. 
   We saw the same devastation in Rwanda over a decade ago, where it is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women and girls were raped during the genocide in Rwanda. The American people have made their voices heard on this issue, vowing never again to remain silent when humanity is threatened. To date, there have been numerous reports of rape. On July 19, 2004, Amnesty International reported that it collected the names of 250 women who have been raped in Darfur and information on 250 additional rapes. 
   On January 25, the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, in a report to the U.N. Secretary General, reported numerous cases of mass rape throughout Darfur. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We must do all that we can to ensure that no more women and girls are violated. 
   So today we give voice to the voiceless. Today we speak up for those who are often overlooked and ask that in this country we do all within our power to stop the rape and sexual violence against the women of the Darfur region. 
   I would like to add my support to the other pieces of Darfur legislation discussed today and applaud all the groups who have truly been on the front line of this issue, particularly the students, who have been so passionate in their support. It is my hope that we will be able to work with the people in the 11th Congressional District and across this country to continue to let our voices be heard on the issue. I encourage my constituents to contact me with your ideas and resources. 
   I know that I'm speaking on another piece of legislation, but they all affect Darfur, and it gives me an opportunity to be heard.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, another opportunity to be here on the floor on Monday night during the Congressional Black Caucus message hour, and you are in the chair. What a privilege. 
   I rise tonight, Madam Speaker, during this message hour to pause to address an ongoing crisis in Darfur. For many years now we have seen the devastating atrocities taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan. With the support of the Sudanese Government, the janjaweed militia has ravaged the people of Darfur, raping, torturing, murdering and forcing hundreds of thousands of Darfuris to flee to refugee camps in neighboring Chad and the Central African Republic. We saw the same devastation in Rwanda over a decade ago; and the American people have made their voices heard on this issue, vowing never again to remain silent when humanity is threatened. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus has been a leader on this issue. I, along with many of my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues, were some of the first Members of Congress to speak out about this issue. We have been to the Sudanese embassy to protest. Many were arrested. We have visited the region numerous times and we have repeatedly addressed this issue with President George Bush in meetings, asking him to take immediate action. Yet, once again, we come to the House floor to challenge this administration to take a stand in Darfur. 
   Madam Speaker, today's Washington Post had this to say about our progress in Darfur: ``A year and a half later, the situation on the ground in Darfur is little changed. More than two million displaced Darfuris, including hundreds of thousands in camps, have been unable to return to their homes. The perpetrators of the worst atrocities remain unpunished. Despite a renewed U.N. push, the international peacekeeping troops that Bush has long been seeking have yet to materialize. Just this weekend, peace talks in Libya aimed at ending the 4-year conflict appear to be floundering because of a boycott by key rebel groups. 
   ``Many of those who have tracked the conflict over the years, including some in his own administration, say Bush has not matched his words with action, allowing initiatives to drop because of inertia or failure to follow up, while proving unable to mobilize either this bureaucracy or the international community.'' 
   I continue to quote from the Washington Post: ``The President, who famously promised not to allow another Rwanda-style mass murder on his watch, has never fully chosen between  those inside his government advocating more pressure on Sudan and those advocating engagement with the Islamist government. So the policy has veered from one approach to the other.'' 
   Today, I am pleased to say that the House passed three resolutions on Darfur, which I will discuss as I come back to the microphone. I am pleased to be joined again this evening, Madam Speaker, by one of my colleagues and good friends, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California. She has been out front, particularly on this issue. We have had an opportunity to have press conferences with several leading Hollywood-types who have really been with us on the issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield such time as she may consume to the great woman from the great State of California (Ms. Lee).

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I include for the Record from today's Washington Post, October 29, 2007, this first part of the article entitled, ``U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions'' by Michael Abramowitz.  
   U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions  
   In April 2006, a small group of Darfur activists--including evangelical Christians, the representative of a Jewish group and a former Sudanese slave--was ushered into the Roosevelt Room at the White House for a private meeting with President Bush. It was the eve of a major rally on the National Mall, and the president spent more than an hour holding forth, displaying a kind of passion that has led some in the White House to dub him the ``Sudan desk officer.'' 
   Bush insisted there must be consequences for rape and murder, and he called for international troops on the ground to protect innocent Darfuris, according to contemporaneous notes by one of those present. He spoke of ``bringing justice'' to the Janjaweed, the Arab militias that have participated in atrocities that the president has repeatedly described as nothing less than ``genocide.'' 
   ``He had an understanding of the issue that went beyond simply responding to a briefing that had been given,'' said David Rubenstein, a participant who was then executive director of the Save Darfur Coalition, which has been sharply critical of the administration's response to the crisis. ``He knew more facts than I expected him to know, and he had a broader political perspective than I expected him to have.'' 
   Yet a year and a half later, the situation on the ground in Darfur is little changed: More than 2 million displaced Darfuris, including hundreds of thousands in camps, have been unable to return to their homes. The perpetrators of the worst atrocities remain unpunished. Despite a renewed U.N. push, the international peacekeeping troops that Bush has long been seeking have yet to materialize. 
   Just this weekend, peace talks in Libya aimed at ending the four-year conflict appeared to be foundering because of a boycott by key rebel groups. 
   Many of those who have tracked the conflict over the years, including some in his own administration, say Bush has not matched his words with action, allowing initiatives to drop because of inertia or failure to follow up, while proving unable to mobilize either his bureaucracy or the international community. 
   The president who famously promised not to allow another Rwanda-style mass murder on his watch has never fully chosen between those inside his government advocating more pressure on Sudan and those advocating engagement with its Islamist government, so the policy has veered from one approach to another. 
   Meanwhile, a constant turnover of key administration advisers on Darfur, such as former deputy secretary of state Robert B. Zoellick and presidential aide Michael Gerson, has made it hard for the administration to maintain focus. 
   ``Bush probably does want something done, but the lack of hands-on follow-up from this White House allowed this to drift,'' said one former State Department official involved in Darfur who did not want to be quoted by name criticizing the president. ``If he says, `There is not going to be genocide on my watch,' and then 2 1/2 years later we are just getting tough action, what gives? He has made statements, but his administration has not given meaning to those statements.'' 
   Since the United States became the first and only government to call the killing in Darfur genocide, Bush and his aides have grappled with how to provide security for civilians in a large, remote area in the heart of Africa. 
   While almost everyone involved in Darfur policy agrees that an African Union peacekeeping force of just 7,000 troops is not up to the task, the United States has refused to send troops and, despite promises of reinforcements, has yet to secure many additional troops from other countries. At the same time, it has been unable to broker a diplomatic resolution that might ease the violence. 
   Even Bush has complained privately that his hands are tied on Darfur because, with the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, he cannot be seen as ``invading another Muslim country,'' according to people who have spoken with him about the issue. 
   ``It's impossible to keep Iraq out of this picture,'' said Edward Mortimer, who served as a top aide to then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and says resentment over Iraq caused many countries to not want to cooperate with the United States on Darfur. 
   Bush advisers argue that the lack of success reflects the limitations of working through institutions such as the United Nations, NATO and the African Union. They cite the billions of dollars of U.S. relief aid that has kept millions of Sudanese alive. They say U.S. pressure has kept the issue on the world's agenda. 
   ``If there was ever a case study where the president sees the limitations and frustrations of the multilateral organizations, it is the issue of Darfur,'' said Dan Bartlett, former White House counselor. ``Everybody for the most part can come to a consensus: Whether you call it genocide or not, we have an urgent security and humanitarian crisis on our hands. Yet these institutions cannot garner the will or ability to come together to save people.'' 
   There is no doubt that responsibility for inaction on Darfur can be spread around. The Sudanese government has resisted cooperation at every step in the saga and has been shielded at the United Nations by China, its main international protector. Few other Western nations, with the notable exception of Britain and some Nordic countries, have shown much interest in resolving the crisis. The process of raising peacekeepers from U.N. members has proved tortuously slow. 
   ``There's an enormous stain on the world's conscience,'' said Mitchell B. Reiss, former State Department policy planning chief. ``We collectively stood by and let it happen a decade after it happened in Rwanda.''

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I want to thank both of my colleagues for their leadership. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, all that you've done around this issue and so many other issues, thank you so much and again for joining me as we do this Congressional Black Caucus message hour. 
   I'm so pleased today that the House passed the three resolutions on Darfur. One of them, H. Res. 573, recognizing and commending the efforts of the United States public and advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening humanitarian crisis and genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and for other purposes. 
   H. Res. 726, calling on the President of the United States and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. 
   And, finally, H. Res. 740, condemning in the strongest terms the attacks on African Union peacekeepers that occurred in Haskanita, Darfur, Sudan, on September 29, 2007. 
   I want to reference back for a moment to the person that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee mentioned and that was my friend from ECOWAS, and ECOWAS is an acronym for the Economic Commission of West African States, and my friend who went to Case Western Reserve Law School as I did is Dr. Muhammad Chambas. Was there something else you wanted to say about Dr. Chambas?

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. The Congresswoman is referencing H. Res. 573, and I want to add my comments to encourage the young people on the college campuses across this country. Many of us recognize in the history of the United States many of the great movements were begun by young people, by students sitting at lunch counters and just the involvement of so many young people. 
   One of the things that people often have said about young people these days is that they're self-centered and only concerned about what's going on in their own lives. I found that not to be true, and I had the opportunity even as recently as this weekend, I happened to be in Iowa campaigning for my candidate for President. 
   And while I was campaigning there, campaigning for Senator Clinton, I met with a group of young University of Iowa students who were complaining about the fact that nothing has happened in Darfur and that they are expecting this government to step up on their behalf. 
   So I want to join my colleague in commending college students, as well as all of the nonprofit organizations across the world who are trying to focus a light or shine a light on what's happening in Darfur. 
   I want to talk for a moment about the whole issue of sex crimes against women and girls in Darfur. One of the worst things to happen to a woman, and particularly a young woman, is for her to be sexually abused or raped. 
   We recognize in this country the impact that this has had. In fact, we recognize it such that we passed the VAWA Act which is the Violence Against Women Act, to help address the issue of violence against women. 
   When you begin to think about the fact that there are thousands of women and girls in these various refugee camps and the things that happen, all we need do is to focus on what happened with Katrina. We had people of the United States of America in a football stadium, and the stories about what happened to young women that were raped right there in Louisiana, in New Orleans, being raped. So you can imagine, if you exponentially take a look at that and see how many thousands of women and children are there, and these women venture out just to get things to help themselves and to continue to live and the fact that they would be subjected to rape and others does not make sense. 
   I can only think about that movie, ``Time to Kill,'' where that young girl in the South who was like 7 or 8 years old got raped by three men and raped her such that she was never able to have any children. It just makes no sense that we would not focus, and let me give you a few statistics. 
   During war, rape and sexual violence are often used systematically as a weapon of intimidation, humiliation, terror and ethnic cleansing. We know right here in America that generally rape is not about sex. It really is about being in control, being in charge. It has nothing to do with the sexual act itself. I won't say ``nothing.'' In many instances, when you're involving children, it does in fact have to do with the sexual act, but it means being in charge. 
   It's estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women and girls were raped during the genocide in Rwanda. On September 2, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Jean-Paul Akayesu guilty of rape and held that rape and sexual assault constitute crimes against humanity.  
   On October 31, the United Nations Security Council adopted Security Council Resolution 1325, calling on all parties to an armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse. 
   The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which entered into force July 1, 2002, states that rape and any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity may constitute both crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
   Since 2003, mass rape committed by members of the Sudanese armed forces and affiliated militia with the support of the Government of Sudan has been a central component of the Government of Sudan's violence and ethnic cleansing in Darfur. 
   Can you imagine this is the army, the militia of a country just having their way, going into camps and violating women and girls, thousands of women and girls who have been violated as a result. 
   Women and girls leaving internally displaced persons camp in Darfur and refugee camps in Eastern Chad to seek firewood, water or outside sources of income are often attacked and subjected to rape. My colleague already spoke to that issue. It is just outrageous that this could continue to happen. 
   On March 9, 2007, members of the United States-United Nations High Level Mission on the Situation of Human Rights in Darfur reported that rape and sexual assault have been widespread and systematic, terrorizing women and breaking down families and communities and that women are also attacked in and around refugee camps in eastern Chad. 
   Think about this: systemic, widespread, terrorizing of women and girls. Systemic. That is just something that I can't even imagine that we would continue to allow happen in another country. We know how great the impact of rape and sexual assault on women and girls in our country over time, and imagine what it would be in a country where they don't have available to them what our women and girls have available to us. Be it counseling, medical care, long-term mental health counseling, it just doesn't happen. 
   So I'm just so happy that the House passed by way of suspension bills today three resolutions around Sudan. 
   Finally, I think that what I would say at this point is that the people of America and all of these nonprofit organizations and the children across this country, women and children and students, must stand up. They must speak up about what's going on in Darfur, and you all know that old statement, that piece of speech that someone gave, and I can't think of the author, and it said, if you're quiet when they come for other people, who's going to speak up when they come for you? And that is what we should all be thinking about, that we need to speak up on behalf of the people of Darfur and say enough is enough; we're not going to have this happen anymore. 
   The United States, under the leadership of George Bush, who's been talking loud and saying nothing on this issue and not moving forward, should move forward to make sure that there are people and peacekeepers going into this area and making sure that these people are taken care of. 
   With that, I would again commend the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK, for her leadership and thank her for giving me the opportunity to lead the Congressional Black Caucus message hour every Monday evening and to give us the opportunity to step up, speak out, and really shine a light on issues that the Congressional Black Caucus is concerned about and that the people of America, regardless of their color, are concerned about. 
   Again, thank you very much, Madam Speaker. It's always good to be leading a Special Order when you're in the chair. I thank you for your leadership as well.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Subcommittee Chair Maxine Waters for your leadership in hosting a hearing in my congressional district. 
   Very quickly, I want to talk about the opportunity to simplify the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit which is included in this bill, and I want to thank you because I have been working on that for years. 
   But I'm really having a problem here today because years ago, we were talking about expanding homeownership opportunity and we did it. But we didn't protect the people. So the predatory lenders got in there and they stole people's property. They stripped the equity from our neighborhoods so that there are senior women who own their homes outright that are now on the streets somewhere. They don't have a home. There are families who will not be able to pass that wealth from one generation to the next. Not only have we robbed this generation, we've robbed grandbabies and great-grandbabies.     
   So what I'm saying to you is we have an opportunity to fix it. We have an opportunity to take care of these folks that have been robbed.

   For the Record, I have a statement from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson to be submitted for the Record. 
   Listen to these statistics. Of the percentage of persons serving in the military, 60 percent are white, 23 percent are African American, 10 percent are Hispanic, 3 Asian American Pacific. Of those serving in the Navy, 62 percent are Caucasian, 19 percent are African American. Those serving in the Air Force, 72 percent are Caucasian, 15 percent are African American, in the Marine Corps, 66 percent are Caucasian, 12 are African American. 
   Let's look at the statistics with regard to deaths as a result of this Iraq war. Of the 3,734 who have been killed in this war, 40 are American Indian or Alaska Native, 69 Asian, 350 African Americans, 405 Hispanic, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 440.     
   Totally in 2007, Caucasian, a total of 3,734.

I want to thank my colleague, the newest Member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who has joined us in the House, Congresswoman LAURA RICHARDSON, from the great State of California, who has joined us on the floor this evening, for her support. I also want to thank my staffer, Aaron Wasserman, for his work and research. 
   Let me close out this Special Order with a few more statistics and a couple of statements. Can you imagine this: The amount of money that we've spent on the Iraq war so far, 270,850,440 children could benefit from receiving health insurance for 1 year. In addition, a Census Bureau news release stated that 8.7 million uninsured children in 2006 could be insured for 31 years with the amount of money that has been used in the Iraq war. The number of 4-year scholarships that could be provided, 21,927,497 scholarships could be provided to the children of the United States nationwide if we used the money from Iraq. 
   And let's talk about, for a moment, the cost to the people of Iraq. A recent article by the Washington Post has said that Iraq needs 10,000 megawatts of electricity per day, but they're only producing 4,110. In civilian casualties, since April of 2004, the average number of Iraqis killed per day has grown from just over 20 to over 100. The total number of Iraqi casualties is estimated to be between 70,264 and 150,000 people. 
   I am so pleased and honored to have an opportunity to be on the floor leading this Special Order on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus. I personally am opposed to any permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq, and no control by the U.S. of Iraqi oil. I am opposed to the surge. The benchmarks not being met are, the GAO says three of 18 were not met, and I am opposed to continued funding for the surge. 
   There is no military solution to this war, and only political and diplomatic solutions will actually work. We should not arm Iraqi security forces when the United States leaves, and we should not leave behind weapons that can be used to perpetuate violence. We have a moral obligation to help with Iraqi national reconciliation and reconstruction. 
   I've been a Member of Congress now for 9 years, and I never thought when I ran for Congress that I would have the responsibility or obligation of attending deployments or attending funerals of my constituents, but as a Member of Congress I see it as my obligation. I'm so happy that even though I oppose this war, that I have a chance to go and meet with many of the Army Reservists and National Guards who have been deployed from my congressional district, and go to them with their families and say to them that I pray for their safe return, that when they return from their mission over in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they all come back. 
   I remember one of the deployments I took a flag that I had flown over the Capitol and gave it to these young men. And I said, I pray that you will bring my flag back. I want you to fly it every day, but when you come back, bring it back, but bring every member of your group back with you. And you know what? They brought me my flag back, and every one of the members of that troop came back home. It was a wonderful thing. But I've witnessed the death of a 19-year-old, Officer Sloan. I've witnessed the death of a 38-year-old. I've witnessed the death of so many young men and women as a result of this particular war. 
   And I say to the American people who are listening to our Special Order this evening, the Congressional Black Caucus believes and argues to the American people that you need to step up your protests. If you believe that this war is not correct and that our troops need to come home, you need to tell somebody. You just can't sit in your chair and be an armchair quarterback. You can't sit back and not say anything. The people, the Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate needs to hear from you. The President needs to hear from you to let him know that we do not support his continued effort over in Iraq. 
   I am pleased, as I said, to be a part of this Special Order. I am pleased to represent the finest congressional district in the United States of America, the 11th Congressional District of Ohio. And I thank all of my constituents for writing, calling, e-mailing, faxing and saying to me, Congresswoman, it is your job to stand up and oppose this war. And ladies and gentlemen of Cleveland and northeast Ohio, that is what I'm doing.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today 50 million Americans have no health insurance, including more than 8 million children. Eight out of 10 uninsured Americans either work or are in working families. Sadly, many of those uninsured and underinsured are African American. 
   Being uninsured means going without needed care. It means minor illnesses become major ones because care is delayed. Tragically, it means that one significant medical expense can wipe out a family's life savings. There are millions of working uninsured Americans who go to bed every night worrying about what will happen to them and their families if a major illness or injury strikes. 
   In my home State of Ohio, there are currently 1,362,000 uninsured, an increase of 18,000 people since 2003. We have also seen the strain on many of the local hospitals in my district when people are forced to use emergency rooms as their source of primary care. 
   The problem is getting worse. As the price of health care continues to rise, fewer individuals and families can afford to pay for coverage. Fewer small businesses are able to provide coverage for their employees, and those that do are struggling to hold on to the coverage they offer. It is a problem that affects all of us, and we cannot sit idly by while the people of this country continue to go without health insurance. 
   Tomorrow, we will have an opportunity to expand one of the most effective government programs implemented in the last decade, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. SCHIP is a joint State-Federal program created in order to provide health insurance to children in low-income households whose income, although meager, was still above Medicaid eligibility.     
   Currently, the program allows for States to provide health insurance to families whose household income is up to 200 percent of the poverty level. In 2006, SCHIP provided coverage to over 6.7 million children, and although it has been successful since its inception, there are still 9 million children without any health insurance, many of whom are minorities. Currently, more than 80 percent of the uninsured African American children and 70 percent of the Hispanic children are eligible for SCHIP but not enrolled. 
   It gives me great pleasure to lead this special hour this evening on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, and I'm pleased at this time to yield time to my colleague and good friend Barbara Lee from California.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. I am about to yield some time to a really good friend of mine who in fact was the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when I was a trial lawyer at the EEOC with my earlier career. But before I do that, I want to make a statement with regard to Jena Six. 
   I have been blessed in my lifetime to have a lot of opportunities in the law. I was an assistant county prosecutor, criminal division for 2 1/2 years; I was a municipal court judge for 2 years; I was a general jurisdiction judge for 8 years; and I also was the Cuyahoga County prosecutor for 8 years before I came to Congress. And I give that statement, my background, so you understand the breadth and the experience that I have. 
   The prosecutor in Jena, as I have come to understand, as with every other prosecutor in this country, has an ethical obligation, and it is very difficult when the light is shone on you. Here we have a young man who has been in jail more than a year, a juvenile. Now a court has said to them that his trial should be overturned. That prosecutor, the prosecutor in Jena, should be saying to himself, duh, should I be rethinking the position I have taken? Should I not encourage the judge to do justice? Should I not say to that judge, grant this young man bail until we work this out?     
   I'm confident it's tough on him because he's got all these other people saying, hold your ground; do what you've been doing. It's a lot easier to hold your ground than to do what's right. And I'm calling upon that prosecutor, the prosecutor in Jena to rethink, go back in a corner in his office all by himself without all the pressure, and contemplate why he was put in office. 
   Prosecutors are some of the most powerful people in this country, and I'm going to encourage young people who are listening to me to become an assistant county prosecutor. When you are the prosecutor, you are vested with so much discretion that you would have the opportunity to reconsider what's happened with this Jena Six. 
   But as I move forward, I want to say to this prosecutor, all of us talk about justice and what's happened in our judicial process, in the judicial system. Young people need to see in judicial officers and prosecutors justice so that they will have faith in the system. 
   Again I'm calling upon this prosecutor to rethink what he did. You know, it's very easy to overcharge. When you overcharge, then you can say to the people, well, I charged him with this, but I was able to get a plea bargain. Justice requires, ethics require that the prosecutor apply the law to  the facts and then make a decision with regard to what the charge should be. 
   In this instance, again, I call upon this prosecutor to take a look at the circumstances. High school kids. And we've seen fights among high school kids where the fights get rough and damage occurs and injury occurs. And I'm not saying by any stretch of the imagination that there should not be some question or responsibility for the conduct that was engaged in. 
   But I call upon the prosecutor again, you do justice. Don't wait for the judge to do justice. Don't wait for God to do justice. It's in your hand to do justice, to use the power that you have, that you've been vested with, that the people of America expect you to do your job; and your job will be to rethink the decisions you've made in this case and make sure that justice applies. And it's in your power to do so. 
   It gives me great pleasure, at this time, to call upon my good friend, one of the great lawyers in the Congressional Black Caucus who's shown leadership in every area that I can think of, my good friend, the Delegate from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, for such time as she may consume.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. If I could reclaim my time for a moment, in my notes with regard to Jena Six, after the new situation where the white students or whoever hung the nooses from the tree, the African American students decided to protest. So here, then, the district attorney, accompanied by the police, comes to the high school and says to them, I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. I can take away your lives with the stroke of a pen. 
   My position would have been, again, and I say this very clearly, that this prosecutor knows that he has power and people know that he has power. But there is this piece of poetry that says that when you are talking to young people, in essence, what they say to you is, I would rather see a sermon than hear one every day. And this district attorney should be setting the example by engaging in conduct and setting justice as his point of entree with these students versus sitting down and saying to them, along with the police, cut down what you are doing because I can be your worst enemy or your best friend. And he truly can, but being someone's worst enemy or best friend is not the gauge by which we would hope that prosecutors in this Nation engage in their conduct and official responsibilities. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia. And I want you to know, and the people of the District of Columbia to know, we are for your having representation and a vote in the Congress, and we are going to be vigilant and keep working on that very issue.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am currently serving on the Ways and Means Committee. As many people have said this evening, I am blessed to be the first African American woman in the history of this country to serve on this committee. I am pleased this year to work my way to the Health Subcommittee. And on that committee, as a part of that committee, I have had the opportunity to work on the recent legislation passed by the House on August 1 that took a vital step towards ensuring the future health of America by approving the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. It was called the CHAMP Act of 2007. 
   On the Health Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to talk with my colleagues and listen to testimony  from doctors and those in health care and those who provide kidney dialysis, et cetera, to help me begin to formulate my position on many issues. 
   One of the things that has been clear to me, however, is if we don't provide health care to our children, we are writing our future. I recently had the opportunity to go to university hospitals in my congressional district to participate with some young people in what's called the Healthy Children program and their focus on obesity, one of the biggest problems that faces children in our country and particularly minority children whose diet tends to be not as healthy, low-income folks, as folks who are able to choose fresh vegetables, fruit, et cetera. And as I was playing with these children, and we were doing exercises and we were rolling around the floor with these exercise balls and these various types of strings to help us lift and move our arms, I noticed that these young people were motivated, motivated, to change their eating habits as well as their life-style. 
   Obesity has claimed so many of our children. Back in the day when I was in school, I remember there was this President's requirement that you had to do so many sit-ups, you had to run so many laps, and you had to be involved in activity. And somehow we have to get our children back to that activity. 
   We have children with high blood pressure. We have children with diabetes. We have children who are working their way to kidney failure as a result of the lack of health care and the lack of preventative health care. 
   So there should be no surprise on the face of any person in the United States of America that we need to have health care coverage for all of our children. 
   Now, the controversy becomes how do you pay for it. And right now we are in this Congress where we are saying we want to be concerned about pay-fors. We want to be fiscally sound. So we either have to come up with a way to tax and change it, or we have to be able to reduce expenditures in other areas. I am one of those who believes that it is time to expend the money that we need to expend for health care, health care for all Americans, because I know we are spending much more than that as we fight this war in Iraq and we provide health care to the people of Iraq and still question whether we provide adequate health care to the veterans of our country who have been injured and maimed over there. 
   But today on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, it has been my pleasure to host this message hour. We have had an opportunity to bring to the attention of the American public our concerns about the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which will be debated on the floor of this House tomorrow. 
   I encourage America to tune in, listen in, and call in and raise your complaints, raise your concerns, and let Members of Congress and Members of the Senate understand how important you know that health care for children is. 
   And, lastly, I will focus back one more time on the Jena Six. It was great to have an opportunity with my colleagues to address that particular issue. And on behalf of our great Chair, Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick of the State of Michigan, I thank the Speaker for granting us this Special Order for today.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Chairwoman, thank you for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I was actually in a Ways and Means hearing on waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, and all of a sudden, someone called and said, they're using your name, they're using your name, they're using your name. So I turned on the television to see what was going on, and I was forced to come to the floor. 
   First of all, let me say that I feel like I am blessed to have the opportunity to chair the Ethics Committee of the U.S. Congress. I come from Cleveland, Ohio. My father carried bags for 40 years for United Airlines, and my mother was a factory worker. To have the opportunity to sit in this seat, the seat that my predecessor, the honorable Congressman Louis Stokes, held for so  many years is indeed an honor and an opportunity. 
   I am so pleased to have an opportunity to work with the committee of men and women who want to do the job of chairing and overseeing the Ethics Committee. I want you to know that DOC HASTINGS and I have worked together for the past 5 or 6 years on ethics, and we will continue to work diligently on behalf of the Members of Congress, the people of the United States, because it is through our responsibilities that we will be able to help people to understand how great the Members of the U.S. Congress are and how great we are at doing our job and taking our responsibilities seriously. 
   I come to the floor reluctantly. I did, in fact, sponsor an amendment with DOC HASTINGS and both of us, in fact, believe that the Ethics Committee could use additional dollars; but I am not going to be used. I am not going to allow the process of a bill with regard to other issues to hold up the dollars that are available to other committees. We understand we operate within a framework of having only so much money. 
   It was not the Rules Committee that had the responsibilities of granting additional dollars. It was the previous committee that previously said on a bipartisan basis, we are not going to give you any more money. So here comes the Rules Committee. We lost in the Rules Committee. I am a big girl, I lost that money, but it doesn't mean I am not going to do my job. 
   Let me finish. Then you can jump up, and, Mr. Dreier, I will, in fact, yield you some of my time. I guarantee you that there may be another mechanism or another vehicle for us to be able to provide the support to the Ethics Committee. 
   Understand, we are going to do our job. We are going to do our job, and I am not going to be used or my amendment to allow anyone to say we can't do our job. Guaranteed, I wouldn't have taken the job. Nancy Pelosi said I was tough and smart. I am both of those. Doc Hastings is tough, and he is smart. We will do our job. 
   I thank you for elevating the Ethics Committee to a level where people think that we ought to have another opportunity. 
   I am so happy to see the majority leader on the floor. We are both from Ohio. In fact, I am going to yield you some of my time. Come on, baby, let's talk. Let's interact.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Boehner, thank you very much, all of you. But let's find a forum to address this issue other than in this process. I guarantee you that our leadership can sit down and work this out. I'm not going to be used. I'm telling you, the Ethics Committee has to stand on its own. We are not going to be in this process. Let's find a way. There is a vehicle by which we can work on giving the Ethics Committee the money that they need without being caught up in this process.

   Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Dreier, I take my time back. You can continue to make those comments if you want to, but I guarantee you that the Members who needed to get information by a certain date got their information. You are not going to use my committee on the floor to be a battling horse for anybody. I tell you, I will live within the dollars I get. I want more. Get them for me.
