<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5104. I do so because there is no reason to extend the Protect America Act. Should the Protect America Act expire, our intelligence community will not be left in the ``dark,'' as some suggest. Rather the FISA courts will simply return to operating under the original FISA law, a law which protected the civil liberties of all Americans while also granting the President the tools he needs to conduct an aggressive campaign against terror. 
   As many of my colleagues have argued today, the original FISA law, which passed in 1978 needs to be updated. It was passed to address surveillance concerns at a different time in our Nation's history, when some of the technological strides we have made since, were simply unimaginable. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I strongly support efforts by the Speaker and leaders of both parties to work together to update FISA. However, I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of a one-month extension of the Protect America Act. I cannot do so because the reality is that the Protect America Act does not make Americans any safer--rather it allows the Government to pursue an enormous and untargeted collection of international communications without court order or meaningful oversight by either Congress or the courts. Furthermore, it is one of the most damaging pieces of legislation against civil liberties I have seen in my eight years in the U.S. Congress. 
   I feel so strongly that the Protect America Act is an affront to our values, that in my opinion it is in the best interest of all Americans that this misguided bill be allowed to expire rather than extended for even one more day. 
   In order to understand why I feel so strongly, let me take a moment to outline some of the most abhorrent provisions in the bill we are considering extending: 
   First, it allows the Attorney General to issue program warrants for international calls without court review. This provision removes the FISA court, which has overseen the process for 30 years and instead places the Attorney General in charge of determining the legitimacy of surveillance. Needless to say, this is an enormous responsibility and we must all question the wisdom of placing so much authority on the shoulders of one Administration official. 
   Secondly, it includes no provisions to prevent ``reverse targeting,'' the practice whereby surveillance is conducted on a foreign person in order to hear their conversations with a person in the United States who is the actual target. Under the Protect America Act, these conversations can be heard, recorded and stored without a warrant. 
   Lastly, the Protect America Act reduces the oversight capabilities of Congress by requiring the Attorney General to provide to Congress only the information the Justice Department sees fit to report. This provision removes an important check upon America's secret surveillance program. 
   Taken together, the Protect America Act represents a significant infringement on each American's civil liberties and allows for a potentially dangerous abuse of power by our government. I urge each of my colleagues to vote against its extension and allow the original FISA law to be reinstated. Doing so will allow the Congress time to work on a bipartisan update of the FISA and in the meantime give the intelligence community the tools they require while also protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I am a strong supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 1108, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it today. I also want to commend and thank Congressman Waxman for introducing this important legislation that will significantly improve public health by strengthening the regulation of tobacco products. 
   There are over 44 million smokers in the United States and over 435,000 tobacco-related deaths each year. In Illinois alone, 24.3 percent of adults and 29.2 percent of youths smoke tobacco. Each year in Illinois, more than 16,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses, including 2,900 adults and children who die of second-hand smoke. In addition, $3.2 billion is spent in direct medical expenditures related to smoking in Illinois. 
   The tobacco industry spends $17 million a day to promote their products. Their targets are often teens, women and minorities. The average age when an individual becomes a daily smoker is 14.5 years. Every day, more than 4000 kids try their first cigarette and about half become addicted to tobacco. Nicotine and other tobacco products have become a pediatric disease. H.R. 1108 would help prevent these potentially deadly products from getting into the hands of children and youth. 
   This legislation would give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the power to regulate the manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products, authorities needed to safeguard the public health and our children. In addition, H.R. 1108 would lessen the cost of smoking-related medical illnesses and prevent adolescents and teens from smoking at a young age. The fact that the tobacco industry is now advertising a new generation of products with unproven claims that they are less harmful makes the need for FDA oversight even more urgent. 
   I am very proud that the State of Illinois has already taken measures to curb the effects of smoking on the public. I also appreciate the efforts that the Illinois Academy of Family Physicians have taken to educate the public and Congress about the dangers of smoking. Already, the Academy's ``Tar Wars'' campaign has had clear and successful results. I see it in the drawing of Alexandra Slane, an elementary school grader from Peoria, who won the Illinois Tar Wars annual poster contest. Her  drawing of a human-shaped light bulb is captioned with a warning to America, ``Be Bright Don't Light!'' Let us all be bright--let us pass H.R. 1108 and act to improve the Nation's health.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, as a conferee on this bill, I proudly rise to support the conference report to H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. 
   When we began this process of reforming the Consumer Product Safety Commission over a year ago, I set out one goal, to ensure that the toys and products I buy for my grandchildren are safe. I am pleased to say that the conference report we are considering today fulfills that goal for all of America's children.     
   H.R. 4040 is legislation that every Member of Congress can be proud to support. It is a product of bipartisan negotiation and compromise. I, too, want to thank our esteemed chairman, JOHN DINGELL, for shepherding us through this process, as well as ranking member JOE BARTON, my fellow conferees, and all of the staff and consumer advocates that worked so hard on this bill. 
   I also want to thank our Senate counterparts. Chairing the conference was Senator Inouye, and the key author of the Senate companion bill was Senator MARK PRYOR of Arkansas. They both deserve the gratitude of the House, especially if they pass this bill this week. 
   I am especially thrilled, however, to welcome back to Washington my friend and chairman of the Consumer Protection Subcommittee and chief sponsor of this bill, Congressman BOBBY RUSH. You have been deeply missed, and I'm so happy to have you back on this momentous occasion which you have made more momentous. 
   With this conference report, Congress is breathing new needed life into the  CPSC. For the first time, we are virtually banning lead in children's products as well as the harmful phthalates that can cause hormonal damage. We're improving the CPSC's enforcement authority and maintaining the authority of State attorneys general to ensure that the products sold in their States comply with the law. And we are providing consumers with a publicly searchable incident database that will allow them to report hazards to one another. 
   There are three provisions I am particularly proud to have authored in this conference report. 
   The first is language directing the CPSC to devise mandatory safety standards for infant and toddler durable products. Those are the things that are in every nursery: cribs, high chairs, playpens, strollers, bassinets. It also requires pre-market testing of those products to ensure that they meet those standards. Bottom line, we will no longer be using our children as test dummies. The government will be ensuring their safety. 
   Second, I'm gratified that the conference report includes the Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act in its entirety. I crafted this legislation in honor of Danny Keysar who was strangled to death when he was 16 months old at his licensed daycare facility when the portable crib he was sleeping in collapsed. The crib that killed Danny had been recalled 5 years earlier, but the daycare center didn't know that. 
   To improve the product recall system, manufacturers of children's products will be required to attach a postage-paid recall registration card to each product that can be mailed in to notify the purchaser when a product is recalled for safety reasons. This provision is a tribute to the work of Danny's parents, Linda Ginzel and Boaz Keysar, who created the organization Kids in Danger 3 weeks after Danny's death in order to prevent other children and families from suffering the same tragedy.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Finally, I am delighted the conference report contains a provision to immediately adopt the set of existing voluntary toy standards as a mandatory standard on an interim basis. Then the CPSC, working with consumer groups, will assess those standards, beginning with the toys that present the greatest hazards, and develop not only the best possible mandatory standards, but require pre-testing to those standards. At last, all toys will be tested before they arrive on toy store shelves. 
   Madam Speaker, the conference report we will adopt today will finally bring the CPSC into the 21st century, and will, I hope, transform it into the world's foremost consumer protection agency. 
   It was an honor to be working on this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (COMMEMORATING IRENA SENDLER -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 361, a resolution I introduced commemorating Irena Sendler, a woman whose bravery saved the lives of thousands of children during the Holocaust, and remembering her legacy of courage, selflessness and hope. I want to thank Chairman Berman for his leadership in bringing this to the floor, and also Senator Obama for offering similar legislation in the Senate. 
   Irena Sendler lived her life by the standards of humanity that she learned from her parents. She once stated, ``I was taught that if you see a person drowning, you must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.'' 
   Sendler was a 29-year-old Catholic employed by the City of Warsaw when the German invasion of Poland ushered in one of the darkest chapters in human history. Disguised as an infection-control nurse, she was able to enter the Warsaw Jewish ghetto to distribute supplies. In 1942, Sendler joined the newly formed underground organization Zegota, working to assist thousands of Jews who had survived mass deportations and were living in hiding. 
   Utilizing her contacts with orphanages, Sendler organized the rescue of Jewish children, smuggling some out in boxes and suitcases, leading others through secret passages and sewers. Children were hidden in Roman Catholic orphanages and convents, as well as private homes, under false identities. Sendler buried a jar with the true name of every child in a friend's garden in hopes of reuniting the children with their families after the war. 
   After she was arrested in October of 1943, Sendler refused to provide the list of names or the identity of her collaborators, even when she was tortured and sentenced to death. She was spared execution only because underground activists managed to bribe officials. After her release, Sendler was forced into hiding but she continued to work to rescue Jewish children. It is estimated that she rescued over 2,500 children. 
   She passed away in May of 2008 at the age of 98. I introduced this resolution with the hope that her legacy will inspire people to fight for human rights. Her heroic story reminds us that the actions of one person can make a real difference in this world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, pay tribute to Irena Sendler, and remind all of us to stand up against oppression and fight for those without a voice.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 361, a resolution I introduced commemorating Irena Sendler, a woman whose bravery saved the lives of thousands of children during the Holocaust, and remembering her legacy of courage, selflessness, and hope. 
   I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman Berman, for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor today. I would also like to thank Senator Obama for offering similar legislation in the Senate. 
   Irena Sendler lived her life by the standards of compassion and humanity that she learned from her parents. She once stated, ``I was taught that if you see a person drowning, you must jump into the water to save them, whether you can swim or not.'' 
   Sendler was a 29-year-old Polish Catholic, employed by the city of Warsaw as a social worker, when the German invasion of Poland ushered in one of the darkest chapters in human history. Jews were rounded up and crowded into the Warsaw ghetto, where poor hygiene and a lack of food and medical supplies led to the outbreak of disease. Sendler managed to pass herself off as an infection-control nurse, enabling her to enter the ghetto and distribute supplies, and she began to smuggle Jews out of the ghetto and into hiding. In 1942, the underground organization Council for the Aid of Jews, known as Zegota, was established following the deportation of 280,000 Jews from Warsaw to Treblinka. Sendler joined the organization, working to assist thousands of Jews who had survived the deportations and were living in hiding. 
   Working with Zegota, Sendler utilized her contacts with orphanages to rescue Jewish children. Young children were smuggled out in boxes and suitcases; older children were led through secret passages and sewers. Many of the children were sent to Roman Catholic orphanages and convents, while others were hidden in private homes. All were given false identities and non-Jewish names. Sendler buried a jar with the true names of every child in a friend's garden, in hopes of reuniting the children with their families after the war. 
   A mother herself, Sendler later recalled that the most difficult part of her work was to convince parents to give their children into her care. They would ask her if she could guarantee their survival, and she would respond that she could not, but she could guarantee that they would likely die if they stayed.  
   Irena Sendler was arrested by the Nazis in October 1943. She managed to hide critical information, including the addresses of the hidden children, before her capture. Although she endured torture and was sentenced to death, she refused to provide the location of the lists of names or the identity of her collaborators. She was spared execution only because other underground activists managed to bribe officials. 
   After her release, Sendler was forced to go into hiding, but she nevertheless continued to work to rescue Jewish children. Although the exact number of children she saved is unknown, it is widely estimated to be over 2,500. After the war, she unearthed the hidden lists and worked to reunite the children with their families. A large majority of the children had no surviving family members, and many were adopted by Polish families, while others were sent to Israel. 
   Irena Sendler's remarkable story garnered little attention after the war. She was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Israel's Yad Vashem on October 19, 1965, but her story was not widely known until 1999, when four high school students in Kansas wrote a play, Life in a Jar, based on her life. The play has since been performed across the United States, Canada, and Europe. In 2003, she was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest civilian decoration, and in 2007 she was honored by the Polish parliament, which unanimously approved a resolution honoring her for organizing the rescue of Jewish children. She was nominated for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. 
   Irena Sendler passed away in May 2008 at the age of 98. Even though her actions saved countless innocent children from a horrific death, she said that she always regretted being unable to do more. 
   In speaking about those non-Jews, like Irena Sendler, who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust, Elie Weisel stated, ``In those times there was darkness everywhere. In heaven and on earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care. These few men and women were vulnerable, afraid, helpless--what made them different from their fellow citizens? ..... Why were there so few?'' 
   I introduced this resolution with the hope that Irena Sendler's legacy would help inspire people to fight for human rights and social justice. Her heroic story reminds us that the actions of one person can make a real difference in this world. As the Talmud teaches, ``whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.'' There is no higher act of selflessness than to protect people who cannot defend themselves. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, to pay tribute to Irena Sendler and to remind all of us to stand up against oppression and fight for those without a voice.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey and Congresswoman Eshoo and all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and their hardworking staffs for bringing this landmark bill to the floor today. 
   This bill strikes to the heart of some of FDA's most troubling issues by granting additional authorities to the Food and Drug Administration that are critical to enhancing drug safety. This bill gives consumers a larger role in deciding how user fees are spent to enhance drug safety, a huge victory for consumer protection. It will take steps to enhance the kind of information that will be available to patients and their families as they make personal decisions regarding their health care. 
   I am particularly pleased by the inclusion of an amendment I offered that will improve consumer's awareness of the MedWatch program, one of FDA's best but least known ways of monitoring adverse drug events once a product has been approved. Consumer reports of bad effects signal to FDA when prescription drugs pose a threat. The success of this program is crucial to postmarketing surveillance. Unfortunately, 9 out of 10 Americans are unaware that the MedWatch program exists, yet adverse drug and device reactions account for as many as 100,000 deaths every year. 
   My amendment requires that printed prescription drug ads include information on how to report side effects to the FDA's MedWatch program, both on the Internet and through a 1-800 number. It also requires the FDA to do a study on how we can best include this important information on the TV ads that have become so pervasive and influential in our society. So, again, I thank the chairman and staff for working with me to include this language. 
   This bill makes a strong statement about the importance of protecting people who rely on prescription medications to get through their day and remain active members of society. I am encouraged by the steps it takes toward a safer, more transparent Food and Drug Administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, last November, the American people voted for change. They were frustrated with the direction our nation was taking and felt that we needed to set a new course. I am so proud to stand before you to say to my colleagues and most importantly the American people, that today we begin to chart that new course on energy policy. 
   For the first time in over 30 years, the House of Representatives will pass a significant energy bill--one that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Our addiction to oil has compromised our national security and causes tremendous damage to our environment. 
   While there are many things to be proud about in this bill, there are two that I would like to highlight. The first is the new fuel economy standard. Today, the average price of gasoline  in the United States is well above three dollars. This puts a tremendous strain on the American people, who in many instances have no option aside from driving to get to work or bring their children to school. Today we pass a bill that raises fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for new cars. This provision alone will save American families between $700 and $1000 per year, by making their cars run more efficiently. It will also reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day in 2020, approximately half of what we import from the Persian Gulf. This will reduce our dependence on oil which comes from the Middle East and politically unstable nations. 
   In addition to raising CAFE standards, the Energy Independence and Security Act also makes a commitment to integrate renewable energy sources into our supply. This commitment comes at precisely the right moment for America. We are at the precipice of developing new technology that will allow our nation to produce alternative energy more efficiently. In order for this development to be realized, however, we must guarantee a demand for the product. That is why the inclusion of a renewable portfolio standard is so important. It creates the demand necessary to spur development. The bill requires utility companies to generate 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. This will mean major investment in products made throughout the country, like ethanol in my home state, wind farms in California, and solar harnessing technology in Florida that will create new jobs and facilitate economic growth. 
   As important as the Energy Independence and Security Act is, it is just the first step and the road in front of us is long. We need an energy program that matches the scale of the threat we face. We will continue to build on the momentum we are creating and I look forward to the day when I can stand before you and say that the United States is completely energy independent. 
   In conclusion I would like to thank the Speaker and Chairman DINGELL for their leadership on this bill throughout the process. We would not be here today without them.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 6, the House Rules Package for the 110th Congress. With the passage of this resolution, we are committing ourselves to restore honest leadership, civility, and fiscal responsibility to the U.S. House of Representatives. It is a commitment that we owe to our constituents and to our Nation. 
   Unfortunately, over the past several years, the House of Representatives was transformed from the people's House into a legislative body where those who could afford to make their influence felt far too often held sway. Legislation was enacted that benefited the wealthy few instead of the vast majority. Legislation was enacted--often in the middle of the night--without time for review or careful consideration. Legislation was enacted to benefit those who could afford to pay for fancy meals and golf vacations while legislation that would improve wages and the quality of life for working Americans was ignored. The process was abused, votes were held open, and amendments were prohibited from being offered. The losers have been the American public. 
   Perhaps the single best example of these abuses is the Medicare Modernization Act, a law which actually prohibits Medicare from negotiating for drug savings, as the VA and large employers do today, and by doing so guarantees that senior citizens and persons with disabilities will pay more than they should for the drugs that they need. This law would not have been enacted if pharmaceutical companies had not been allowed to use undue influence, if Democratic conferees had not been locked out of the negotiations, if Members had not been intimidated on the House floor, and if the final vote had not been held open for nearly 3 hours to change the outcome. 
   During the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, we will eliminate this prohibition and require that Medicare use its bargaining clout on behalf of consumers. Today, we are taking steps to make sure that the procedural abuses that were used to enact that prohibition will become a relic of the past. 
   We also begin the 110th Congress by putting our financial house in order. The past 6 years of fiscal mismanagement has turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into an over $3 trillion deficit. The passage of H. Res. 6 will help us get our current debt and financial crisis under control while allowing us to make the investments needed for American families and our economic future. 
   With the restoration of pay-as-you-go budgeting, Congress will not be able to increase the deficit and make future generations of Americans carry a debt load so that today's wealthy can get tax cuts like the ones passed over the past few years. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, those tax cuts, which primarily benefit the very rich, are the main cause of our country's fiscal reversal. Reining in the spiraling debt will give us a chance to invest in our communities, create jobs, provide retirement security, and stimulate our economy. 
   Transparency requirements for earmarks will also help us make certain that taxpayers' dollars are put to good use while eliminating wasteful spending. I believe that district-specific earmarks on appropriations or other legislation should not be provided unless they directly improve our communities. Requiring better disclosure of sponsorship of earmarks and ensuring that Members have no personal financial interest in the request will help us guarantee that the funding is targeted to essential infrastructure improvements, community development, vital research, and other important programs. Congress has a long history of providing earmarks for such projects, and I support their continued funding and eliminating  the abuses of earmarks like the ``Bridge to Nowhere.'' 
   H. Res. 6 is the first action of the 110th Congress. By its passage, we are demonstrating to the American public that we are going to return the House of Representatives to its rightful role as being the people's House--not just in procedures but also in policy.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman DINGELL as well as the Democratic leadership for working so hard to bring the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill before us today. H.R. 976 is not a compromise that was easily come by, and it's important to recognize the hard work that has gone into it. 
   Let's be clear, today each of us is either voting for providing healthcare to more uninsured children, or voting against covering more uninsured kids. 
   This bill is not the bill that I would have written, nor is it as good as the bill that passed the House. But it will cover the 6.6 million children currently covered by CHIP and will reach an additional 4 million kids. It also provides children with dental coverage and finally puts mental health services on par with other medical benefits covered under the program. This bill will also improve quality improvement, outreach, and enrollment efforts under CHIP, and will target those most in need. It is a good bill that we think will get to the President's desk. Thus, I think the commitment this bill makes to our children should be celebrated. 
   Yet, we need to push further and pass several provisions that were in the house bill, including meaningful improvements in access to basic health services, including granting access to our legal immigrant children, more affordable prescription drug costs and benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities, and adequate reimbursements for physicians that provide critical care to the Medicare population. 
   Incredibly, President Bush has pledged to veto this compromise, bipartisan, bicameral measure. The President and the Congressional Republican leadership say that we cannot afford it. We can't afford to cover children, but we can afford the war in Iraq. The bill to provide health care to children will cost $35 billion over the next 5 years--but we will spend over $50 billion in the next 5 months in Iraq. 
   While this bill could have been so much more to so many of our constituents, it does  bring us a necessary, moderate expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Fourteen million dollars in an hour, 24/7, over 5 years, $10 billion per month, 4,000 dead Americans, tens of thousands of wounded warriors, untold sacrifice of military families, innocent civilians in Iraq killed by the hundreds of thousands, and one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. That is the cost of this war. 
   And do you know, the President says that he has sacrificed, too. Yes. He has sacrificed. He has given up golf. 
   And the President has determined to veto the bill when it gets to him because it includes really a patriot tax on people who make over $1 million. They are going to help to pay for things like an expanded GI Bill for our veterans that come back, a GI Bill that will cost about 5 months in Iraq over 10 years, and yet the President has said that he wants to----

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I take back my time. 
   We are talking about people who are making over $1 million to pay a small sacrifice for this war where our military families are paying a huge sacrifice. 
   The question really is, though, what are we doing there? What is the mission of our young men and women? Who is the enemy? Who is our ally? What does victory even look like? 
   I am not going to vote for another penny for this tragic war except to bring our troops home or to resolve the humanitarian crisis our government has helped create. I am not voting to give more to the real winners of this war, the Halliburtons and the Blackwaters. And I am disappointed about my amendment to stop funding Blackwater. This company raises the question, is it the policy of the United States to let companies like that get away with murder? We should cut that contract and bring our troops home.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to express my enormous appreciation to Congresswoman Diana DeGette. 
   This morning Speaker Pelosi said, this is really a great day, not only in the United States Congress but for the American people around the country. Many times we deal with issues that are either sort of lower on the list of importance. We name post offices. We give certain honors to individuals. That's all good. But today we're dealing with an issue that affects millions, over 100 million Americans, really not a family that's not touched by Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, as Diana DeGette's daughter is. And like many mothers who come to the Congress and ask us to address issues that have affected their children, Diana DeGette is in a position to actually make something happen, and she has, in the most educated, illuminated, compassionate way, to bring this legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives today. 
   I also rise in the name of our beloved friend and part of our congressional family, Lane Evans. Lane is one of the million Americans who suffers from Parkinson's disease, who has had to cut his career short. His leadership and dedication to making progress with stem cell research was inspiring. He understood the hope that embryonic stem cell research holds for so many like him. It's time that we pass this bill for people like Lane Evans; a hero, a Marine, someone who has fought all his life. And now we need to fight for him. 
   I also rise in support of this bill for my friend, Bonnie Wilson, and her daughter, Jenna, who's one of the 7 million American children living with diabetes. Stem cell treatment may be her only hope. It's time that we finally make progress, put aside ideology, and, yes, it is about ideology versus science, and pay attention to the science. And I want to thank all the children and parents, the children who have diabetes who have come to me year after year after year after year to my office, told me about the shots that they take, the parents waking up several times during the night to check the levels on their children; worrying day and night that they are going to get that phone call that there has been some disaster. It's for them that we do this. And so we're standing today on the brink of incredible scientific breakthroughs that are going to address the issues that plague all our families. My family has been plagued by the early loss of my daughter-in-law, Fiona, to cancer. 
   Let me just say then, for Fiona and for my grandchildren who were left motherless at a very, very young age, and all the families, I'm not alone. No one's alone in this; that we stand together today to say we believe in a cure. We want to support a cure. We, the American people, through our taxpayer dollars, what could be a better expenditure of that? Should we throw away unused embryonic stem cells? Should we toss in the garbage, literally, the possibility of these cures? I don't think so. Let's take that leap today for our children and future generations.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (SECURELY PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST CYBER TRESPASS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 964, the Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act--the SPY Act. It is a strong consumer protection bill, of which I am an original cosponsor, that will help us in the fight against identity theft.  
   With today's vote, the House will have passed the SPY Act three times. Let's hope that the third time's a charm--and that today's passage means this bill will finally get signed into law. 
   The SPY Act is important because it protects consumers from spyware, the unwanted and sneaky software that is so powerful that it can steal information from, monitor and control others' computers--without the computer's owner even knowing the software has been installed. 
   The SPY Act would put the control of computers back in the hands of consumers--where it belongs. It prohibits indefensible uses of the software, like phishing and logging every keystroke entered, and requires that consumers be notified and opt-in before software is installed on their computers. Furthermore, the SPY Act gives the Federal Trade Commission the additional power it needs to pursue deceptive uses of the software. 
   I believe that this bill will go a long way toward protecting consumers from having their valuable and personal information stolen by purveyors of spyware. I am glad that I was part of the bipartisan process that brought this bill to the floor today. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Thank you.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, only a week after the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract, the Bush administration was at it again giving more praise to Blackwater, the private military contractors. Last Friday, Ambassador Crocker said contractors ``like Blackwater are absolutely essential.'' 
   But was it absolutely essential for Blackwater to gun down 17 innocent Iraqis? Was it absolutely essential for a Blackwater employee to kill a guard to the Vice President of Iraq? Was it absolutely essential for a Blackwater helicopter to drop CS gas on a traffic jam in Baghdad? 
   It has been months, and some in cases years, since these incidents and we still don't have the results of those investigations. Instead, our government has ignored those abuses and renewed Blackwater's contract and then a week later said they are absolutely essential. What kind of country do we live in where it's acceptable for the United States government to praise and reward a company that kills innocent people? 
   The only thing that is absolutely essential is that we end this State Department's dependence on private military contractors now.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 118, which congratulates Chicago for being chosen to represent the United States in the international competition to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and encourages the International Olympic Committee to select Chicago as the site of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I can not think of a better city than my hometown of Chicago to represent the United States in its bid to win the 2016 Olympics Games. 
   Chicago is a great American city that is rich in diversity, culture, tradition and history. The City is home to nearly 3 million residents that represent hundreds of different nationalities and ethnicities ..... a truly international city. Chicago's vibrant communities, sound infrastructure and extensive transportation network make it the perfect fit for the 2016 Olympics. 
   The Olympic Games are a great opportunity for the world to come together and put aside their differences to celebrate the achievements of athletes. The Olympics have been able to transcend cultural, religious and political boundaries by making all of us realize that there is more that unites us than divides us, which could also be said for the City of Chicago. The Games have also played a significant role in creating social and political change in the United States and across the globe. 
   I would also like to congratulate Mayor Daley and Governor Blagojevich for securing this victory on behalf of the City of Chicago and I wish them continued success in their efforts to win this bid in front of the International Olympic Committee in 2009. I am confident that the rest of the world will realize what we already know-that Chicago is the ideal city to host the 2016 Olympic Games. I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res 118.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly support H.R. 2929, a bill to prohibit permanent bases in Iraq, and I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) for their persistent leadership on this important issue. 
   The House passed the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq this month to get our troops out of Iraq by April. The question now is not whether we will redeploy our troops, but when and how. 
   This resolution makes it emphatically clear to the Iraqi people and to President Bush that we do not intend to keep troops in Iraq indefinitely.     
   The United States must not be seen as an occupier. Otherwise, our presence there will be used to recruit insurgents, to keep Iraq entrenched in violence and to create an even more dangerous environment for our troops. 
   This House, too, has already expressed its opposition to permanent bases, but today, we do it clearly with bipartisan support and send a very clear statement. I urge all of our colleagues to listen to the will of the American people, of the Iraqi people, and to support H.R. 2929.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman so much for giving me the time to speak on this important bill. 
   The digital television transition is now 223 days away and many of our constituents are simply not prepared. I'm especially concerned about our most vulnerable population, our seniors. Eight million older Americans are in risk of losing their television reception on February 17, 2009. 
   I've been pleased to work with a number of groups that work directly with seniors, including the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, the AARP, and the National Council on Aging, to ensure that older Americans are not left in the dark. 
   In May, Representative G.K. Butterfield joined me and 21 of our colleagues in sending a letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration regarding this imminent problem, and I'm pleased that the bill before us today would take some of the necessary steps to ensuring that seniors are prepared. 
   Seniors could suffer real consequences if their TVs do not operate past February 17, 2009, including isolation from society, anxiety, or mental and physical decline. Imagine your parents or grandparents going to turn on the television on February 18 and finding nothing on the screen. 
   Also, we have to remember that there are hundreds and thousands of homebound seniors who are unable to go and buy a converter box. Many seniors face considerable physical challenges associated with the transition, and without people to help come in their homes and install these boxes, they're just going to be out of luck. And those seniors that have gotten the converter box may face real technological barriers. Most people have problems setting the clock on their VCRs. I have zeros blinking myself occasionally. Think about the challenge of looking at a converter box and trying to figure out what to do next. 
   That's why I rise in support of this bill. This legislation will free up funds not being used by the NTIA in the distribution of coupons so they can be used for consumer education and technical assistance. 
   It further directs NTIA to partner with, provide grants to, and contract with nonprofit organizations and public interest groups to provide for educational and technical assistance to seniors, rural residents, and others who may face difficulties with the digital transition. 
   Despite these efforts, there are sure to be people who we don't reach and who wake up on February 18 with no signal. I look forward to working with my colleagues to establish any future  funding needed to ensure that these individuals receive needed assistance. 
   Again, we're 223 days away from the digital television transition. I urge all of my colleagues to work to ensure that our constituents are aware of and prepared for the coming transition. 
   I want to thank the leadership for bringing this crucial bill to the floor quickly.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (DANNY KEYSAR CHILD PRODUCT SAFETY NOTIFICATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I'd first like to thank the chairman of the Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection subcommittee, Mr. Rush, for his support and help. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Stearns for his support of the legislation, as well as full committee Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton.     
   It is clear that our system for recalling dangerous products is simply broken. It is failing American families. The recall system relies on the media to pick up the story and spread the word, but many times the stories are not picked up and the news does not reach the owners of defective products. In fact, some estimate that the recall effectiveness rate for products under jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is a mere 16 percent. Notification targeted to owners of the product is rare, and many parents remain unaware of the dangers. 
   And that's why I rise in strong support of H.R. 1699, the Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, which I was proud to introduce with my good friend from Michigan, Congressman Upton. This bill will begin to close the significant gaps in the recall system by requiring that durable children's products such as cribs and strollers and high chairs come with a postage-paid postcard that parents or caregivers can mail in to be notified if a product is recalled for safety reasons. 
   This legislation is a commonsense solution to a very real and pervasive problem. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an estimated 64,700 children under the age of 5 were treated in emergency rooms across the country for injuries associated with nursery products in 2003 at a cost of $2.5 billion, and that figure has almost certainly risen in the last 4 years. And even more tragically, an average of 50 children under the age of 5 die each year in incidents associated with nursery products, and about 16 of these deaths each year are associated with cribs. 
   And this bill is a tribute to one such child. On May 12, 1998, 16-month-old Danny Keysar was strangled to death at his licensed day care facility when a portable crib collapsed, turning the horizontal side rail into a V-shaped wedge that squeezed his throat and strangled him. Imagine what Danny's parents must have felt when they learned that the crib that killed their son, a Playskool Travel-Lite crib, had been recalled by the government and the manufacturer 5 years earlier. 
   And, sadly, Danny's parents aren't alone. More than 1.5 million portable cribs like the one that killed Danny were made with a similar design by different manufacturers. The crib that took Danny's life had already killed four children. A 10-month-old New Jersey baby became the sixth child to be strangled to death by the Playskool crib just 3 months after Danny died. 
   Despite the recall, neither the day care center nor State inspectors who had been to the facility just a week before Danny's death knew that recalled products were being used there. And they are not to blame. It was not the State agency's mandate to inspect for recalled materials; and unless someone who worked in the center happened to catch the recall story on the news, there was virtually no way to know that the cribs they used were death traps. And, by the way, Illinois did change its law. 
   But in case anyone might think this was an isolated incident, think again. In 2005 children's products were recalled on average two times a week. Just over 2 weeks ago, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the largest recall of full-sized cribs in the agency's history, recalling almost a million of the Nation's most popular cribs because of design flaws that have already killed at least three more children. And a week later, Kolcraft, the company that manufactured the Playskool crib that killed Danny Keysar, recalled 425,000 infant play yards following the death of a 10-month-old child. 
   Congress needs to act to make sure that these kinds of senseless tragedies don't occur again. When Danny's parents, Linda Ginzel and Boaz Keysar, learned that the crib that had killed their son had been recalled in 1993, they turned their grief into action and founded Kids in Danger, a Chicago-based nonprofit that is dedicated to protecting children by improving children's product safety. It is because of their dedication that we are here today, and I am honored to represent them here today and thank them for their work. I hope with the passage of this legislation no more parents will have to endure what they did. 
   I believe that H.R. 1699, which allows people to send in a card or e-mail to make sure that the manufacturer will let them know, just as is done with car seats in the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration, a provision that has been so successful that there has been a tenfold increase in recalls and recall repair rates have gone up by 56 percent, that at a cost of a handful of pennies per card, this legislation will save lives of children. 
   I would appreciate support.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DUMPING OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE INTO THE GREAT LAKES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Let me just give you a few numbers here: 30 million, that's the number of people who depend on the Great Lakes for our drinking water; 20 percent, that's the percent of fresh surface water on the entire planet that is represented by the Great Lakes; $6 billion, that's the amount of money that BP earned in the last quarter. BP is one of the most profitable companies on the entire planet, and a company that has spent a considerable amount of money promoting its green image. 
   I want to quote to you from a Chicago Tribune Voice of the People article that was written by a BP Whiting Refinery individual, and he talks about, he minimizes the problem. He says: ``Of the 23 substances regulated in the permit, ammonia and total suspended solids are the only two limits that will increase when compared to the current permit.'' No problem, only two out of 23. 
   And later, consistent with BP's bragging about its environmental excellence says about itself: ``This is just one of the ways we have demonstrated our focus on continual improvement in environmental performance. Our commitment to continuous improvement will carry on as we modernize the refinery.'' Meantime, increasing the amount of ammonia and the amount of total suspended solid waste. 
   What's the consequence of those emissions? The health consequences can't be understated. Dumping ammonia represents a direct threat to the health of millions of Americans living in the Great Lakes region. For example, ammonia in the water promotes algae blooms that can kill fish and trigger beach closings. So here is another number: 1,585 pounds of ammonia, a 54-percent increase every day, every day into our precious Lake Michigan. And 4,925 pounds of liquid waste consisting of suspended particulate matter, a 35-percent increase every day into Lake Michigan. 
   In addition to putting our health at risk, the decision to allow BP to increase their dumpage also puts the lake ecosystem in jeopardy. Increasing the amount of liquid waste consisting of suspended particulate matter dumped into the lake each day endangers the marine life by making the water cloudy, thereby making it more difficult for fish to find ample amounts of oxygen. 
   This is a big deal. This is a serious problem, and it is incredible that the Environmental Protection Agency and BP and the State of Indiana would allow it. It is an outrage. We can stop it.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6867, the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008. Today we learned that for the ninth straight month the economy has lost jobs--159,000 jobs in the last month alone. That represents the largest 1-month loss of jobs in more than 5 years. Over the last 12 months, more than 2 million Americans have joined the ranks of the unemployed. The national unemployment rate is now at 6.1 percent, and in my home State of Illinois it is at 7.3 percent. 
   Today's news come at a time when millions of people in Illinois and across the country are already struggling to figure out how they can pay their bills, feed their families, and keep a roof over their head. H.R. 6867 will help ease some of that pain and fear by extending unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who have lost their job as more businesses are forced to cut shifts and lay people off because of rising prices, a decline in business, and the credit crisis. 
   H.R. 6867 would provide 7 weeks of extended benefits for workers who have exhausted regular unemployment compensation, with workers in high unemployment States like Illinois eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits. Nearly 800,000 workers are projected to exhaust their current extended unemployment benefits in October unless Congress acts. 
   On the day that we are directing billions of taxpayer dollars to stabilize the financial markets, it is incumbent on Congress to provide direct relief to those struggling to make ends meet. In addition to unemployment insurance, I believe we also need to make investments in our highways, bridges, transit systems, and schools; we need increases in food stamp benefits; and we need a crucial temporary increase in Medicaid payments to States. Studies have shown that those are some of the quickest forms of economic stimulus because those benefits and investments are spent quickly. 
   Again, I urge strong support of the legislation and look forward to working with all of my colleagues to support policies that create jobs and jump start our economy.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. On Monday, the House failed to pass a rescue package, and the stock market dropped 777 points--the biggest one day point drop in US. history. The impact of that drop wasn't just felt on Wall Street; it was also felt on Main Street. On Monday alone, Americans lost $1.2 trillion in the stock market. Almost 50 percent of Americans are invested in the stock market in some way, whether through retirement accounts or private investments, and they rely on credit and their investments to make ends meet. 
   This legislation is about protecting people's retirement accounts and pension plans. In the last year, investments have declined by nearly 24 percent, putting the retirement security of millions at risk; I am worried that without this package, they will continue to the downward spiral. This legislation is about making sure that there is enough credit in order for students and families to take out loans to afford to go to college. It is about letting businesses make their payroll. It is about helping people stay in their homes. That is why dozens of groups representing educators, colleges, the homeless, pension managers, and others support this legislation, 
   I want to make it very clear that I think this legislation is far from perfect--and, like many of my colleagues, I would have written a very different bill. However, I believe that Monday demonstrated that we had to act. Years of harmful Republican policies that pushed for deregulation and tolerated an almost total lack of enforcement, and a misguided philosophy that insisted that an unregulated market can heal all ills, have now led us to the brink of economic collapse. And I am deeply concerned--and hundreds of economists agree--that the failure to act could lead to a major economic depression. 
   Again, the rescue plan, while still imperfect, has come a long way from where we began. Instead of giving the President $700 billion with virtually no oversight or safeguards, we require Congressional review after the first $350 billion. And this legislation requires equity sharing, so taxpayers would benefit from future growth in the investments they have bought, and it requires Wall Street to pay back any losses to the Government. We are stopping forms of executive compensation that would encourage executives to take excessive risks, eliminating golden parachutes for executives who take part in the Government program, and cracking down on excessive compensation practices for the first time in history. And we include strong, independent oversight to protect the taxpayer, including two oversight boards to ensure that the Treasury Secretary is acting on good faith, as well as judicial review over the Secretary's actions. 
   While I would have liked to see the tax provisions paid for by rolling back some of the President's tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes, there are also important tax fixes that will benefit millions of Americans and small businesses across the country. The legislation provides property tax relief to up to 30 million homeowners--extending a new $1,000 property tax deduction for non-itemizing couples through the end of 2009. It extends the qualified tuition deduction for low- and middle-income Americans. It extends the child tax credit, which will benefit millions of Americans with children age 17 and younger. It extends the Research and Development tax credit, which spurs innovation and job growth in the technology sector. And it extends critical renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits to help the green economy take shape. 
   This legislation also contains critical, comprehensive mental health parity legislation that will bring mental health insurance benefits in line with physical benefits. I have not held a health care meeting in my district without the issue of access to mental health care being brought up by my constituents who have faced discrimination or difficulty obtaining affordable care. I am proud that we are continuing Senator Paul Wellstone's legacy by passing a bill that guarantees equal access to mental health and substance abuse treatment. I also want to thank Representatives Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad for their persistence and passion in passing the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   There is so much more we should do. I am strongly committed to enacting a second stimulus package that will truly benefit the American people. Today the House enacted 7 weeks of extended benefits for workers who have exhausted regular unemployment compensation, with workers in high unemployment states eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits. However, I believe we also need to make investments in our highways, bridges, transit systems, and schools; we need increases in food stamps benefits; and we need a crucial temporary increase in Medicaid payments to States. Studies have shown that those are some of the quickest forms of economic stimulus because those benefits and investments are spent quickly. 
   This bill represents unfinished business. I will fight my hardest to make sure that we rein in the excesses of corporate America in the next Congress, and to see to it that this crisis does not happen again.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 369, supporting the goals and ideals of National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I'm proud to offer my support for designating May 2008 as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. 
   Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass, structural deterioration of bone, and increased susceptibility to fractures. Osteoporosis is a leading cause of fractures, which is of special concern to the aging as it takes longer for older bones to heal than younger Americans. In 2005 alone, osteoporosis was responsible for an estimated 2 million fractures. 
   While osteoporosis is rightly associated with aging, bone health is a concern for people of all ages. In this spirit, House Resolution 369 urges everyone to observe appropriate activities with regard to osteoporosis and to talk with health care professionals about bone health. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, for her leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor today. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I, myself, a while ago was diagnosed with a pre-osteoporosis condition, and it's rewarding to find that if you take the medication and you do weight lifting kind of exercises that you can actually reverse the process. Now my screenings indicate that I no longer have those symptoms, although I continue to take the medication and do the exercises. So people should not see it as totally irreversible or untreatable in any way. But most of all, I think the emphasis on prevention is so very important.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to express my gratitude to Chairman Dingell for his support in bringing this resolution to the floor today. I want to also thank Congressman Roskam for his support and cosponsorship of this resolution. 
   For me, the heart and soul behind the effort to establish a Brain Tumor  Awareness Month has been the Lori Arquilla Andersen Foundation, which is in my home district in Illinois. 
   Many of us have been touched by cancer, my family included. But when Linda Magiera lost her precious daughter, Lori, to brain cancer in 2005, she made sure to continue her daughter's passion for life and desire to help others by creating the Lori Arquilla Andersen Foundation in her name. 
   Lori was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme stage 4 brain cancer, one of the most deadly, at the age of 33, just 3 months after her wedding. She passed away 22 months to the day after her first of five surgeries. 
   I am told by those who knew her that Lori was always upbeat, positive, courageous, and smiling. The Lori Arquilla Andersen Foundation has exemplified that energy over the past years. They have made important strides in increasing awareness and raising funds for brain tumor research, but they are also responsible for bringing the issues that are important to the brain tumor community as well as this resolution to my attention. 
   While the Andersen Foundation has managed to put a face on these issues for me, the larger brain tumor community has also done incredible work over the past decade. They have worked tirelessly to support people with brain tumors and their families, raise awareness of the disease and its effects, and to attain resolutions from governors, State legislators, city councils, and mayors in support of establishing a Brain Tumor Awareness Month in May. Today, we take one giant step forward in advancing their cause. And it won't be a moment too soon. 
   Over 44,500 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the brain or spine each year; and among children, brain tumors are the second most common cancer and comprise approximately 25 percent of all pediatric cancers. Although less prevalent than other cancers such as lung, breast, or prostate cancer, brain tumors are in no way trivial for those who have them. Because they are located in the ``control center,'' the thought, memory, emotion, sensation, and movement, brain tumors have serious and at times devastating effects on the lives of patients and their families. Brain tumors can change an individual's personality, their ability to communicate, and their ability to walk or see. 
   Unfortunately, with over 126 different kinds of primary brain tumors, the development of effective treatments is uncommonly complicated.     
   The 5-year survival rate following the diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumor is about 30 percent. However, the average survival rate for patients with glioblastomas is less than 5 percent, and most survive for only 6 to 12 months. We must continue to work towards finding a cure for this terrible disease. 
   Strong support for ongoing research is the answer, and increased awareness is the first step in getting there. I'm so pleased to be making progress on this resolution today. And with the recent Race For Hope which was held on Sunday, March 4, here in Washington, DC, and raised $1.62 million for brain tumor research, it is certainly timely. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Dingell and his staff for their hard work in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1022, which is aimed at reducing maternal mortality, both at home and abroad. As an original cosponsor of this resolution and a member of the Women's Caucus, I am proud to speak out in support of its passage. 
   This week begins an entire week of maternal mortality awareness events. During this week, women from abroad will provide firsthand accounts of horrific maternal health challenges they've faced. Globally, it is estimated that 15 percent of pregnancies and child births involve unpredictable and often life-threatening complications that require emergency care. What makes this statistic so staggering is that nearly all of these situations are preventable. 
   Even more astounding is the fact that the United States ranks a staggering 41st among 171 countries in a United Nations list ranking infant mortality. We can and we must do a better job. 
   The resolution before us affirms our commitment to promoting maternal mortality and child survival, both at home and abroad. It also recognizes that maternal health is fundamental to the well-being of families and societies. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Lois Capps, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the rest of the Congressional Women's Caucus for their leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I first want to congratulate the sponsors and thank them, Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad, for their tireless effort on behalf of this bipartisan bill. I also want to pay tribute to Paul Wellstone. He and his wife Sheila were very good friends of me and my family. They were both leaders in ending discrimination and making sure that every person in this country has access to affordable comprehensive care, including comprehensive mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
   And, if Paul were here today, he would no doubt tell some stories about those he had met throughout the years who would benefit from passing H.R. 1424. And in his absence today, I remember the many, many constituents who I have heard from since first being elected to the Illinois State legislature many years ago who shared with me the need, their desperate need to pass mental health parity legislation. 
   Every year, about 40 million of us will experience some type of mental disorder; yet one out of every two children and two out of every three adults with diagnosable mental disorders go without treatment. 
   The good news is that so many mental illnesses are manageable and treatable and curable. The bad news is that, for so many, treatment for mental illness lies far beyond their reach due to high cost sharing and lower caps on services.  
   Some have said that using the handbook that defines mental health illnesses and is used by the mental health professionals somehow will add to the costs and jeopardize access altogether. But when implemented in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, our own program, in 2001, costs did not increase and not one single insurer dropped out. If we are able to benefit from this level of coverage, shouldn't our constituents get at least that much? 
   Maintaining strong mental health is just as important as maintaining strong physical health, and it is critical that we pass the strongest parity bill we can today.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (RUSH LIMBAUGH'S ``PHONY SOLDIER'' COMMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Well, Rush Limbaugh is at it again. Unable to defend an indefensible war in Iraq, he has once again resorted to ``sliming'' the messenger. In this case, unbelievably, the messengers he's going after are the brave men and women who have served their country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other wars. 
   Men and women who serve in Iraq differ from Rush Limbaugh in two critical ways. First, unlike Mr. Limbaugh, they actually served in the military. Second, unlike Mr. Limbaugh, they understand that the war in Iraq is making our country less safe and destroying the military. 
   How dare Rush Limbaugh label anyone who has served in the military as a ``phony soldier.'' How dare he say that his views in Iraq, formed in the comfort of his radio studio, are legitimate, while the views of those whose opinions were forged on the battlefield are not. Could Rush Limbaugh actually face soldiers who have risked their lives and tell them that their beliefs don't matter? 
   These are soldiers like Brandon Friedman, a former rifle platoon leader in the Army's 101st Airborne Division who fought in Afghanistan in 2002 and commanded troops in Iraq. He says, ``The escalation of the war is failing and now the mission must change. The fact is,'' he says, ``the Iraq war has kept us from devoting assets we need to fight terrorists worldwide, as evidenced by the fact that Osama bin Laden is still on the loose and al Qaeda has been able to rebuild. We need an effective strategy that takes the fight to our real enemies abroad, and the best way to do that is to get our troops out of the middle of the civil war in Iraq.'' Is Brandon Friedman a phony? 
   Or Josh Gaines, who earned the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the National Defense Service Medal during his 2 years in Iraq, he believes the war in Iraq was a mistake from the beginning. Is he a phony? Or retired General William Odom, the head of the National Security Agency during the Reagan administration. His advice: ``The sensible policy is not to stay the course in Iraq. It is rapid withdrawal, re-establishing strong relations with our allies in Europe, showing confidence in the U.N. Security Council, and trying to knit together a large coalition, including the major states of Europe, Japan, South Korea, China and India to back a strategy for stabilizing the area from the eastern Mediterranean to Afghanistan to Pakistan.'' General Odom says: ``Until the United States withdraws from Iraq and admits its strategic error, no such coalition can be formed. Thus those fear leaving a mess are actually helping make things worse while preventing a new strategic approach with some promise of success.'' 
   Does Rush Limbaugh really want to look General Odom in the eye and call him a phony? I believe that we should all pay attention to the views of Brandon Friedman and Josh Gaines and General Odom whose beliefs, like their military experience, are real. And while we're at it, let's pay attention to the 72 percent of American troops serving in Iraq who also think the U.S. should exit the country within the next year, and more than one in four who say the troops should leave immediately, according to the Zogby poll. I guess they're all a bunch of phonies, according to Rush Limbaugh. 
   Our military men and women deserve respect. Apparently, however, Mr. Limbaugh thinks they deserve to be smeared and belittled unless they happen to agree with him. I understand why Rush Limbaugh cannot debate this war on the merits, but bashing soldiers and veterans who disagree with him is unpatriotic and un-American.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (INTERNATIONAL FOOD CRISIS AND HAITI -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Clarke, for convening us tonight for this Special Order dealing with our close friend and a great friend of the United States, and that's our neighbor Haiti. 
   I first went to Haiti in January of 2003. And I went with the RFK Foundation, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Foundation, and Ethel Kennedy was on that trip, to give an award to Partners in Health Clinic on the Central Plateau of Haiti. It's actually the one that was featured recently on ``60 Minutes'' where you saw Dr. David Walton, who actually comes from my district; Dr. Paul Farmer; Loune Viaud, who is the director of that clinic, serving people on the very poor Central Plateau of Haiti. And I have to tell you I think it was Representative Green who said his first trip he was thunderstruck. That's a good word for it. You get on the plane in Miami and you start reading the newspaper, and before you've even finished reading it, you're landing in the poorest country in our hemisphere. 
   But let's be clear. This is a country with beautiful and brave and hard-working people. This is a country where some of our colleagues of a certain age may have even gone for their honeymoon. This is a tropical island in the Caribbean with so much potential and such beautiful people and such incredible poverty. 
   I went again to Haiti in 2006 with Wyclef Jean, a son of Haiti and a musical artist who has created a foundation called Yele Haiti, who's hard at work right now in providing food for the people of Haiti. 
   So we can talk about the crisis first. There is a horrible hunger crisis in Haiti. They started out poor. They started out malnourished when these food prices went up so high. And in fact, the average daily requirement for calories is about 2,100 calories per day. In Haiti it's 460 calories below that as the average. So you know some people are eating more than their 2,100 and lots of people are eating less. 
   I implore parents who may be listening to us tonight to think about what kind of desperation it might take to feed your child to quench the hunger in their belly a mud cake, a mud cake, a cake literally made out of mud with a little flour in it, because you can't stand to leave that tiny stomach hungry. It's just more than one can even bear to think how one gets to that point. 
   And so the high price of food and the hunger crisis has begun riots in Haiti. There have been some political ramifications, and the United States has to some important extent responded. We're sending money. We're sending food. And all of this is really, really important. 
   But the other thing I found out in Haiti is that it's not just oh, poor, Haiti, we need to do more. The fact of the matter is, and I am embarrassed to say, is that the United States of America has had its heel on the neck of the country of Haiti and has actually been part of the problem that we are facing today. 
   Over the past 7 years, the Bush administration has absolutely turned a blind eye and has, in fact, actively stopped the Inter-American Development Bank from releasing loans to Haiti for projects on water and health and education and rural roads, the kinds of things that would actually make Haiti self-sustainable. Through the U.S. Treasury, the Bush administration officials, and this is all about ideology and politics, have repeatedly held back vital loans for Haiti in an attempt to force political change in Haiti, actions in direct violation of the Inter-American Development Bank charter, IDB. 
   In e-mails released in response to a Freedom of Information request, Treasury Department employees repeatedly discuss how to ``slow'' the release of loans to Haiti. In a Treasury Department e-mail in 2001, this employee stated that the loans would be released based on ``our assessment of progress on reaching a comprehensive political settlement.'' That is, a settlement to the liking of the United States of America. 
   In another shocking e-mail, a Treasury lawyer reveals just how deliberately they were working to stop the loans from being released to Haiti, despite the great need. Bruce Juba, Special Counsel, wrote: ``While this is not a 'bullet-proof' way to stop IDB disbursements, it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road.'' 
   It is astounding and unacceptable that the entire time that the Bush administration has talked about helping poor Haiti, they have been working behind the scenes to put ``rocks in the road'' to Haiti's development. By 2002 the Bush administration's plan to block the loans to Haiti by slowing them down has succeeded. Haiti fell into arrears long enough to trigger an Inter-American Development Bank policy that prevents the bank from releasing the loans when arrears have accumulated for too long. Success. 
   Instead of receiving the vital loans for public projects, loans that could have helped bring thousands out of poverty, reduced water-borne diseases, and aided in long-term development, the Bush administration successfully cut off Haiti's IDB funding in an effort to push Aristide out of power. 
   The United States has been directly involved in Haiti's food crisis in another way. The U.S. has forced Haiti to open its market to our subsidized crops, decimating the ability of Haitian farmers to compete. Thirty years ago Haiti raised nearly all of the rice it needed. It was exporting sugar. But because of U.S. intervention, Haiti is now reliant on food imports for survival. The International Monetary Fund forced Haiti to open its market to U.S. rice first in 1986 as a condition for loans, making it impossible for Haitian farmers to compete with subsidized U.S. rice. Then in 1994, as a condition for U.S. assistance in returning to Haiti to resume his elected presidency, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was forced by the U.S., the IMF, and the World Bank to open up the markets in Haiti even more. 
   So, look, if we want to do more than put a temporary Band-Aid on the developing food crisis in Haiti, we're going to have to do more than allocate money for emergency food relief. We're going to need to recognize how forcing poor countries to open their markets to our heavily subsidized crops cripples their ability to sustain themselves. 
   As President Lula of Brazil said when he was visiting Haiti recently, ``Rich countries need to reduce farm subsidies and trade barriers to allow poor countries to generate income with food exports. Either the world solves the unfair trade system or every time there's unrest in Haiti, we adopt emergency measures and send a little bit of food to temporarily ease hunger.'' 
   You talked about the level of unemployment in Haiti. Well, a number of these people are rural people who are at least sustaining themselves. Even if they weren't exporting food, the country was able to provide the rice and the beans that it needed to sustain itself. 
   So we need to have a sane and rational policy when it comes to Haiti, a policy of friendship to this country in our hemisphere, not a policy that cripples Haiti's ability to actually flourish. We have a huge responsibility here for the hunger that's going on here now, and we should understand that and not just feel so good about our ourselves when we send food aid to Haiti, which, of course, we should do and we should do even more of. 
   So I appreciate the opportunity to join you tonight, Congresswoman Clarke. I appreciate your leadership as a new Member of Congress. I so welcome your leadership on this issue and just want to offer my support in absolutely any way that I can so that we can be a good neighbor to Haiti and to the rest of the developing world. 
   Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise to say that I will support H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, not happily, and not because I think the titans of Wall Street are deserving of our help. I am casting my yes vote because I am concerned about hardworking families in my district, the homeowners, small businesses and those who rely on modest pensions and investments. These are the people who knew well before the President or Wall Street woke up to the fact that our economy was in serious trouble, because they have friends and loved ones who have lost their jobs or house; they saw the price of gas and milk hit $4 a gallon, and they are struggling to afford good health insurance. 
   Yes, we must do something and today is the day. But we must also recognize how we got here. This is, in fact, the predictable result of years of misguided policies of the Bush Administration, the misguided belief that regulation of the markets, any regulation, was bad. Couple this with a lack of enforcement of regulations that did exist, and now we have a financial crisis that requires government intervention. 
   As a freshman member of the House Financial Services Committee, I was one of only 57 Members of Congress to vote against the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. By deregulating the financial services industry and removing consumer protections, that legislation set in motion the crisis that we are facing today. My colleague and friend, Barney Frank, now the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, a true progressive and the chief negotiator for this bill, also voted against that reckless measure. 
   I have consulted with many of the Nation's top economists, including top progressive economists, and virtually all have agreed that a failure to act would have devastating effects on the global economy--including your block and mine. Without quick action, employers might fail to make payroll, private student loans are already drying up, pensions would continue to lose value, and mortgages would become sparse. While I am not certain that this legislation will be able to fully stabilize the economic turmoil, I believe that we need to vote for the possibility of success over the certainty of failure. 
   The House Democratic leadership, and especially Chairman Frank, has worked to make the very bad bill presented by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry 
   Paulson better. The administration came to Congress with a breathtakingly arrogant plan--a mere three pages, 800 words, which basically said give us $700 billion for a plan that is ``non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.'' Today, we are offering our 110-page reply, and while it is certainly not perfect, I believe it is substantially improved. 
   Today we are saying ``no'' to a blank check! Congress cut in half the Administration's automatic $700 billion, requiring Congressional review for future payments. We are making sure  that none of the CEO's who have run their companies into the ground and created this mess will retire with a ``Golden Parachute.'' We make sure that taxpayers get a share of the profits of participating companies, and require the next President to submit a plan to ensure that taxpayers are repaid in full by Wall Street. We help prevent home foreclosures destroying our neighborhoods by allowing Government to work with loan servicers on new mortgage terms. Finally, we ensure tough, independent oversight and transparency, including judicial review of the Treasury Secretary's actions. 
   Unfortunately, because of the need to obtain bipartisan support to move a bill quickly, this bill is by no means perfect. I believe that this legislation should have included bankruptcy protections and mandatory mortgage restructuring for homeowners in or at risk of foreclosure. I believe that we need to crack down on the lobbying practices and stop campaign contributions from companies which are clearly too irresponsible to manage themselves. 
   I am extremely disappointed that, even as we address part of the economic crisis, we failed to enact a second economic stimulus that would immediately create jobs and put money in the pockets of middle class families and struggling State and local governments. Unfortunately, the plan to extend unemployment compensation, increase food stamp and health care funding, and create jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure failed in the Senate last week. This is clearly unfinished business. 
   Today's vote represents the first step in reforming Wall Street and restarting our economy. For the first time in history, this Congress is addressing the excesses in executive compensation. This legislation gives the Treasury Secretary authority that could be used, if he or the next Secretary so choose, to significantly help low-income and working families. Finally, we are setting in motion the process of a comprehensive reform of the financial services industry. 
   Wall Street better get the message that Congress will never be ready with a blank check to clean up the messes that they made in the first place. I look forward to working with the next Administration and my colleagues in Congress to enact sensible regulations to ensure that this will not happen again.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, budget resolutions give us the opportunity to debate national priorities, the vision that we have not just for the next 5 years, but for our future. And nothing is more important for that future than providing opportunities for our children. 
   Over the past weeks, many of my constituents have called and written to ask that we reject the President's budget priorities, particularly in the area of children's health. Nine million children are uninsured. Every 46 seconds, a baby is born without health coverage. In the richest country in the history of the world, every day children are forced to go without the medical care that they need. The President's budget doesn't solve this crisis. It doesn't even come close. 
   The President wants to cut Medicaid, and his budget provides $7 billion less than what is needed just to maintain current caseloads in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Shortfalls would continue. States would have to put more children on waiting lists. Benefits would be reduced. 
   The Progressive Caucus believes that no child should be forced to stand in a long line when it comes to health care. Our budget provides enough funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover every eligible child. Our budget truly puts children first. Like the Spratt budget, which provides an additional $50 billion in SCHIP money, we are setting the priorities that will keep American children healthy and make our country strong. 
   The Republicans care about families all right, rich families. And they care about children. It just doesn't happen to be the children of ordinary working families in this country. The Progressive Caucus budget does take care of those families.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 249, a bill to restore the prohibition on the sale for slaughter of wild horses and burros. 
   Behind closed doors, language was added to the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill that overturned the 33-year-old ban on the slaughter of wild horses and burros. Immediately, Congress rejected this ploy by voting to amend the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill to reinstate the ban. That amendment, introduced by Congressman Nick Rahall, passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 249-159 in the House and the same amendment was included in the fiscal year 2007 bill. We must restore a permanent ban on the slaughter of wild horses and burros to ensure that they remain protected. 
   Legislators are working to put an end to horse slaughter in this country because horses are some of the most beautiful and beloved domesticated animals on earth. Americans have long appreciated horses--for transport, on ranches, as police mounts, and as cherished companions. America's wild horses are especially prized. The approximately 28,500 horses and burros that roam public land--our prairies, ranges, and the open plains--are cherished symbols of American freedom. 
   The American Horse Council reports that 1.9 million Americans currently own horses. Another 7.1 million Americans are involved in the industry as horse owners, service providers, employees and volunteers, while tens of millions participate in horse events as spectators. These millions of Americans know that horses should be treated with dignity and respect in life and death. They are disgusted, as I am, that in 2006 over 100,000 horses were slaughtered at three American-based, foreign-owned plants so that the meat could be shipped to Europe and Asia for consumption as a delicacy. And they are saddened that wild horses were sentenced to the same fate, despite the Bureau of Land Management's access to humane options, including adoption, sterilization, relocation, and placement with qualified organizations and individuals. 
   Not surprisingly, a recent poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies found that 65 percent of Americans do not support horse slaughter. And 64 percent of Americans believe that horses are a companion animal, like dogs and cats, and killing a horse to eat is not different than killing a cat or dog to eat. 
   I think it's time to listen to the American public and finally end the barbaric practice of horse slaughter, for wild horses, and for all horses. This legislation demonstrates that we are willing to heed the call of the American people, and take the necessary steps to protect horses from an inhumane and unjust fate.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (CONTRACTOR ACCOUNTABILITY -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, Blackwater contractors opened fire in Baghdad's Nisoor Square, killing 17 Iraqi civilians. This wasn't the first time private security contractors used excessive force. 
   It has now been 21 months since the Christmas Eve murder in the Green Zone, and 3 1/2 years since a Blackwater helicopter dropped CS gas on a traffic jam in Baghdad. Yet there have been no arrests, no charges, no trials and no conviction. In fact, the Blackwater contractor responsible for the Christmas Eve shooting is now employed as a prison guard in Washington State. 
   Instead of holding Blackwater accountable for violating the law, last April the State Department rewarded Blackwater by renewing their billion dollar contract. Before we even consider giving Blackwater another penny of U.S. taxpayer dollars, we should hold private security contractors accountable under the law. 
   On the 1-year anniversary, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Stop Outsourcing Security, SOS, Act, H.R. 4102, to begin phasing out the use of private security contractors. The longer we wait to fix this problem, the worse the situation is going to get, not only for Iraqi civilians, but for our troops on the ground.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, this is such an exciting day. Today, we say to the nearly 200,000 students every year who do not attend college for financial reasons, you deserve better. You deserve better than outdated financial aid packages, crippling debt, and empty promises of support once you graduate. Today we are delivering on that promise. 
   Higher education has become increasingly important in this country and around the world, yet it has been rapidly slipping from the grasp of thousands and thousands of students every year. Over the past several years, states have cut higher education funding and in many cases, passed that cost on to students. 
   Student loans, which for two-thirds of our students average $20,000, not only affect student's financial viability down the road, they effect the range of opportunities that are available to new graduates as they seek out professions that will enable them to repay their loans. Education is supposed to be the gateway to opportunity, not the path to financial ruin. 
   One of the most important provisions of H.R. 2669 is an expansion of eligibility and an increase in the Pell grant scholarship to $5,200 over the next 5 years. This bill will also encourage and enable graduates to go into the public service fields they're interested in--and which our country so desperately needs--by providing loan forgiveness for first responders, early childhood educators, librarians, nurses, public defenders, and public prosecutors. These professions are some of the most important to our communities, yet they are chronically undersupported. 
   This bill will also provide tuition assistance to students who commit to teaching in public schools, high-poverty communities, and high-need subject areas. It also makes a landmark investment in Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Tribally Controlled, Native or Predominately Black Institutions. 
   By redirecting excessive Federal subsidies for lenders in the student loan industry, these new commitments will come at no additional cost to taxpayers. It's time that taxpayer dollars go towards our student's future--and the future of our competitiveness as a nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this remarkable legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act. Nearly 15 million Americans, almost two-thirds of them women, go to work every day caring for our children and frail old people, cleaning up our messes, serving us food in restaurants, and for their efforts receive $5.15 an hour, the Federal minimum wage. If they work 52 forty-hour weeks, their annual income adds up to $10,712--$4,367 under the poverty level for a family of three. 
   Other Americans--the CEOs of the Nation's top companies--made on average $10,712 in the first two hours of the first workday of new year. According to a report by Americans United for Change, those CEOs make $5,279 an hour, $10,982,000 a year, or 1,025 times more than their minimum wage employees. 
   Those CEOs must really be special compared to the woman who changes their mothers' diapers or cleans their toilets. If she is a single mom with two children, she has to work 3 minimum wage jobs to provide for her family, according to Wider Opportunities for Women. 
   It didn't surprise me that a Newsweek poll found that 68 percent of Americans believed ``increasing the minimum wage'' should be one of the top priorities for the new Democratic Congress. And it's no wonder that women around the country and in my district are signing petitions, calling, sending e-mails calling on us to raise the minimum wage. 
   Leta of Chicago wrote that ``We need to increase the minimum wage,'' and Rebecca e-mailed to say that an increase ``is shamefully overdue.'' Jacqueline in Skokie asked me to ``Please restore a government which truly responds to the needs of the people.'' 
   It's hard to imagine any member of Congress objecting. After all, it's been 10 years, the longest span ever, since the minimum wage was raised. In that time, we members of Congress have received cost-of-living increases that have raised our salaries over $30,000. 
   Today is the day we stand up for our lowest paid workers. Today is the day we give 15 million Americans a raise. And when we pass this modest increase, we should think of it as a down-payment on our commitment to assure that every hardworking American receives a living wage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I'd like to thank Chairman Skelton for working with me on my amendment to prohibit private security contractors from performing inherently governmental functions in combat areas, and for offering his support. 
   We've all heard about the violent incidents involving private security contractors injuring and killing civilians in Iraq and elsewhere. This is a systemic problem that exists because private employees are currently being tasked with extremely sensitive jobs like gathering intelligence and providing armed security. 
   And it is a systematic problem that private contractors do not wear the badge of the United States, are clearly not part of the chain of command, are not subject to the same accountability that those who are employed with the badge of the United States, and that those contractors have often damaged the credibility of our military and harmed our relationship with the Iraqi government. 
   We want to show the American people and the Iraqis, that there are inherently governmental functions that will only be performed by people in the U.S. military or our U.S. Government personnel. 
   I urge support for this entire bill and for this amendment.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Look, law enforcement is using videotaping because it not only is a matter of protection for the person that is being interrogated, but for the interrogator, him or herself, as well. There are rules that guide interrogations. Having those tapes is a safeguard that we can have to make sure that the rules of interrogation set down by the Department of Defense will protect those people as well. If they need to be disguised in some way, I believe that the amendment would allow for that. This is to protect both the interrogator and the one who is being interrogated.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Today the New York Times reports that at least 14 of the 17 shootings from the September 16 Blackwater incident in Iraq were unjustified and violated deadly force rules. 
   Even though the FBI concluded that Blackwater, a for-profit contractor, used excessive force, there is no guarantee that anyone will be punished for these killings. 
   On Monday, the front page of the New York Times ran a story titled ``Security Guard Fires From Convoy, Killing Iraqi Driver.'' The shooter was an employee of DynCorp, and the victim an Iraqi taxi driver. The details of the incident are still unclear, but one thing is certain. The problem of trigger-happy contractors isn't confined to one company; it applies to all private security contractors. 
   The longer we wait to fix this problem, the worse the situation is going to get for the Iraqis and for our troops. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Stop Outsourcing Security Act, H.R. 4102, to phase out unaccountable private security contractors before they do any more damage.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. The war in Iraq is a disaster and it's time to bring our brave troops, the men and women who volunteered to serve their country for the right reasons but were sent to Iraq for the wrong reasons. It is time now for them to come home. 
   For that reason, I support this bill which, for the first time, ties funding to the responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, beginning within 30 days of passage and to end in December 2008. 
   I'm supporting this bill for another important reason. It establishes once and for all that the United States of America does not torture people. This bill is not confused about waterboarding. Waterboarding is clearly made illegal, as well as electric shocks and mock executions and every other gruesome interrogation method that is currently prohibited in the Army Field Manual. 
   The American people elected the Democratic majority in this House last November because they're done with the war. They're sick and tired of losing American lives in Iraq. And they're sick and tired of losing vital programs at home to continue to finance this tragic war. 
   This is a vote of conscience. I urge every one of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, as a founding and active member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, someone who identifies closely with the peace movement and a ``no'' vote on the war itself, I rise in support of this measure because for the first time we have a date certain for the war to end, a date when U.S. combat troops must be out of Iraq. 
   It is not the bill I would have written, but it moves us closer to the goal, as clearly stated by Speaker Pelosi, of ending the war in Iraq. 
   Like many progressives, I have consistently voted against funding for this war. We have withstood Republican critics who say we are hurting the troops, because we know the way to care for them is to get them out of the meat grinder that is Iraq. 
   This vote draws a clear line between those who want to stay indefinitely in an unwinnable war and those of us who, along with the majority of Americans, want to end it. After 4 horrifying years of war, finally the issue before us now is when, not if, we will leave Iraq. 
   We aren't going to end the war with any one vote, but this vote should be the beginning of the end of this tragic chapter in our history. It will have my support.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and for her great support for this measure, and I also thank Representative Ros-Lehtinen for her help for a long time making this resolution possible today. 
   I do rise in support of H. Res. 149, the International Women's Day resolution. I want to also thank Representative Judy Biggert, who is the lead Republican sponsor, for her consistent support and work to bring this resolution to the House floor. We have introduced this resolution honoring women three times, and it has been a pleasure working with her over the years. 
   Also, as the vice chair of the Women's Caucus, I am honored to have this resolution to be the first of our top five priority agenda items to make it to the House floor with such remarkable bipartisan support under the leadership of the chairwomen, Lois Capps and Cathy McMorris Rodgers. I appreciate their help. 
   Each year, countries around the world mark March 8 as International Women's Day as a day to recognize the contributions and the impact that women have made to our world's history, to recognize those women who have worked for gender equality and to acknowledge the work that is yet to be done. 
   Over the years, women have made significant strides. Women all over the world and throughout history have consistently contributed to their economies, participated in their governments and improved the quality of life of their families and their Nations. 
   In 2007, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi became the first woman in the history of the United States to be Speaker of the House. In 2006, I attended the inauguration of Michelle Bachelet, the first woman President of Chile, and visited in Liberia its President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman President in Africa's history. In the 110th Congress, we have an all-time high of 74 women in Congress, a 35 percent increase from just 8 years ago. However, women still make up only 16 percent of the House of Representatives. 
   In the United States, we have made significant strides in education. In fact, women now graduate from high school at higher rates and earn bachelor's or higher degrees at greater rates than men. While that is true, yet two-thirds of the 876 million illiterate individuals in the world are women. That is, two-thirds of them are women. Two-thirds of the 125 million school-aged children who are not attending school worldwide are girls, and girls are less likely to complete school than boys elsewhere around the world. 
   Women are making progress in business, and women make up 11 of the current CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. However, more progress still needs to be made. While great strides have been made in business, women still earn less, own less and have less access to education and employment than men. Globally, while women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce one-half of the world's food, we still earn only 1 percent of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the world's property. Of the 300 million people living in poverty, 70 percent are girls and women. 
   Although Congress passed the PROTECT Act, a good bipartisan bill to prevent trafficking, there are still millions of women and girls who are trafficked, physically abused, sexually abused or face the threat of violence every day. In Iraq, Darfur and Afghanistan, women and girls continue to be the targets of extreme violence, brutality and intimidation where they face overwhelming, if not insurmountable, obstacles to legal recourse and justice. And in times of war and conflict, although most women and children are not engaged in that conflict, they continue to suffer the most. 
   So, Madam Speaker, it is important that Congress recognize the importance of March 8 and participate with the rest of the world in celebrating International Women's Day. Hopefully, the passage of this critical resolution will help raise awareness of the work we need to do and will help women continue to overcome the overwhelming obstacles that are still left to be overcome. 
   We must make a commitment to invest in women. Women contribute to the growth of economies and improve the quality of the lives of their families, the health of their communities and their Nations. We have won many battles for equality and justice for women worldwide, and we can do it. 
   The passage of this resolution puts us, the United States House of Representatives, firmly on the side of women who are seeking gender equality across the world, and I urge its passage

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. This bill is an offense to the Constitution that we are sworn to protect. Let me tell you what we are voting on tonight. 
   If we pass this bill, we are voting for the warrantless, that means no court order, warrantless surveillance of our phone calls, a warrantless collection of personal data, e-mails, and Internet usage, the evisceration of the power of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court, and making it little more than a rubber stamp for Alberto Gonzales. Are these the principles our Nation was built on? 
   Our Founding Fathers knew better. 
   John Adams: ``A Constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored. Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.'' 
   We have Thomas Jefferson: ``I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than  to those attending too small a degree of it.'' 
   And, finally, Ben Franklin: ``They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' 
   We can have liberty and safety. The House Democrats offered that plan. We should heed the word of our Founding Fathers and reject this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank our chairman for yielding me this time and for his great leadership on this issue, and for making it clear that this veto was about torture. 
   In December, I said that restrictions on the use of torture represented a battle for the soul of our country. Because the President chose to veto this critically important piece of legislation, that battle continues today. 
   The way we treat our prisoners is a fundamental measure of our character. It is what separates great nations with moral authority to lead from other lesser nations. 
   The President's national security team has now publicly confirmed that the CIA waterboarded detainees. Incredibly, President Bush and his advisers insist that they have the legal authority to do so again and that they don't consider it torture. These claims have damaged our Nation's moral authority and credibility around the world. 
   There is a simple way to restore some of our moral authority. It is in this bill in the form of a provision mandating that all intelligence agencies and those under contract or subcontract with our intelligence agencies comply with the U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogation guidelines. 
   The interrogation rules in the Army Field Manual have served us well, but don't just take my word for it. Generals, intelligence professionals, diplomats, religious leaders, and foreign leaders, many of them our closest allies, have all spoken out against the use of coercive techniques such as waterboarding. 
   Consider the words of Navy Rear Admiral Mark Buzby, Commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, which is already required to comply with the Army Field Manual, who recently stated that ``we get so much dependable information from just sitting down and having a conversation and treating them like human beings in a businesslike manner.'' Or what about the advice of the Republican Presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, who, before changing his mind and joining with President Bush to oppose this bill and with it Congress' effort to ban torture, stated that the issue of interrogation was ``a defining issue'' and that interrogation should be ``humane and yet effective.'' And that an Army general in Iraq had told him that ``the techniques under the Army Field Manual are working and working effectively, and he didn't think they need to do anything else.'' 
   In December, Congress made its voice known and passed this critically important bill. With one flick of his pen, the President tried to take our voice way. I believe it is time to say once and for all ``no'' to techniques like waterboarding, ``no'' to torture, and ``no'' to this President's attempt to legitimize his administration's political legacy at the cost of this Nation's moral authority. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join with me in voting to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (OUT OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you in the Chair, and I thank the gentleman for allowing me to do this. 
   I am a proud member of the Out of Iraq Caucus, and my office has been flooded with letters and calls from constituents who want the President to start bringing the troops home from Iraq. According to all the polls, an overwhelming number of Americans are opposed to any escalation. 
   Instead of a plan to begin redeployment, Americans heard a giant sucking sound from President Bush last night, pulling our troops further into the civil war that has already taken the lives of so many of our brave sons and daughters. 
   The President is dealing with an Iraq that exists only in his imagination. I challenge the President to answer the questions: Who are our allies? Who are our enemies? What does winning mean? How long will American troops be there? How many lives are you willing to sacrifice? 
   Escalation presumes a military solution is still possible. The catastrophe facing Iraq is political, and yet there is no evidence of a political process that has any hope of achieving any kind of reconciliation or success. 
   The President has virtually fired General John Abizaid, our top commander for Iraq in the region, who consulted with all of the divisional commanders and asked them in their professional opinion, if we were to bring in more troops would it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq. They all said no, but the President has not listened. 
   The British have announced that rather than escalating their participation in this war, they are going to bring 3,000 troops out of Iraq in May.     
   We are not receiving support from any allies. So it seems to me, as now a sponsor of the Markey-Kennedy bill, H.R. 353, that Congress has to step in, has to state its belief that this escalation is misguided. And according to the Markey-Kennedy bill, it would prevent the President from spending another taxpayer dollar to increase troop levels in Iraq without the consent of Congress. And after 4 years, it is time for President Bush to wake up and realize that his policy in Iraq has failed. Most of the country has already come to that conclusion. 
   Now, we must renew our military, work to restore our diplomatic credibility and, above all, begin redeploying our troops out of Iraq. 
   And I would like to yield the remaining time to my colleague from California, Lynn Woolsey.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman so much for her relentless and effective leadership, and express my gratitude to Congressman Castle. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3. I have been struck and moved by the number of colleagues who have come here and cited their own family members, including their children, as the driving force behind their support. But none of us should be surprised, since 100 million Americans are afflicted with diseases that potentially could be cured by embryonic stem cell research. And I have heard from so many of them from my own district. Why destroy their hope? 
   And I rise today in the name of our beloved friend and part of our Congressional family, Lane Evans. Lane is one of the million Americans who suffer from Parkinson's Disease, and that has cut his career short. And during his time in Congress, Lane was dedicated to advancing stem cell research because he understands what it is like to struggle with an incapacitating disease. And he understands the hope that embryonic stem cell research holds. Why would we want to destroy that hope? 
   And I want to thank all of my friends from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation from my district and their children, who have served as advocates in such an effective way and met with me on a regular basis and educated me about this. And my dear friend, Bonnie Wilson, whose daughter, Jenna, has juvenile diabetes and has lived with that for her whole life. Why would we want to destroy their hope?     
   Since I have been in Congress, I have received letters from people like Liz O'Malley, and she describes the daily struggle of her son, Seamus. Seamus has muscular dystrophy. He is only 11 years old. Stem cell treatment may be his only hope. Why would we destroy that hope? 
   Illinois has already awarded $10 million in grant funding to research institutes and hospitals because Governor Blagojevich recognizes the advances. Now we can do it on a Federal level. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Seventy-two percent of Americans and a bi-partisan majority of Congress strongly support embryonic stem cell research. The research could prove to improve the lives and ease the suffering of the over 100 million Americans who have juvenile diabetes, ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, heart disease, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, and other diseases. 
   Parkinson's affects over 1 million people, including my close friend and our colleague, former-Rep. Lane Evans. During his time in Congress, Lane was dedicated to advancing stem cell research because he understands what it is like to struggle with an incapacitating disease, and he understands the hope that embryonic stem cell research held. Why would we want to destroy that hope? 
   I would like to thank the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and their young advocates for all the work they have done to raise awareness about the need to pursue embryonic stem cell research. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation recognizes the need to allow embryonic stem cell research to transcend political lines and partisan fighting so that critical gains can be made in medicine in America and millions of human lives could be saved. I would also like to send a special thanks to my friend, Bonnie Wilson, whose daughter has juvenile diabetes. 
   Since I have been in Congress, I have received an overwhelming number of calls and letters from my constituents detailing their daily pain and suffering from debilitating diseases. In March 2006, I received a letter from my constituent Liz O'Malley. In her letter, she described the daily struggles of her son, Seamus. Seamus has muscular dystrophy. He is only 11-years old. Stem cell treatment may be his only hope. Why would we want to destroy that hope? 
   The opponents of this measure wrongly portray the decision on funding for additional stem cell research as a choice between one life or another. In fact, we are choosing between disposing of embryonic stem cells or using those cells to save countless lives and advance life-saving science in previously unrealized ways. Embryonic stem cell research offers the hope of a better life. It is incomprehensible that anyone would allow politics and personal preference to trump hard facts and science. They wrongly portray amniotic fluid stem cells as the only legitimate form of stem cell research. While this method is promising, it should not be the only type of stem cell research conducted. Every type of stem cell is different, every type has a unique ability, and none are a replacement for another. Any strides made in one form of stem cell research may be essential to gains in another area. We must not act to prevent embryonic stem cell research and dash the hopes of so many families who are battling critical illnesses and disorders. 
   America has always been on the cutting edge of innovation and now we stand on the brink of groundbreaking medical advancements that would dramatically alter the lives of people such as Seamus. We must not prohibit this promising research. States are already moving forward with this research by committing public funds. Illinois has already awarded $10 million in grant funding to research institutes and hospitals because Governor Blagojavich recognizes the advances embryonic stem cell research could make in science and medicine and the great potential it holds. I urge my colleagues vote to ``yes'' on H.R. 3 and to follow the lead of Illinois and many other states and allow for Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 152, which recognizes the 40th anniversary of the reunification of the City of Jerusalem. 
   This week Israel is recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War. On June 7, 1967, Israel reunified the city of Jerusalem, opening it to worshippers of all nationalities and religions. 
   On that day Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan declared: ``This morning, the Israel Defense Forces liberated Jerusalem. We have united Jerusalem, the divided capital of Israel. We have returned to the holiest of our holy places, never to part from it again. To our Arab neighbors we extend, also at this hour--and with added emphasis at this hour--our hand in peace. And to our Christian and Muslim fellow citizens, we solemnly promise full religious freedom and rights. We did not come to Jerusalem for the sake of other peoples' holy places, and not to interfere with the adherents of other faiths, but in order to safeguard its entirety, and to live there together with others, in unity.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, even 40 years after Israel's overwhelming victory in the June 1967 War--a war fought to preserve Israel's very existence in the face of enemies determined to destroy it--Israel's stability is still threatened. At this critical time in Israel's history we must focus on what is of the utmost importance--furthering the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
   Congress must fully analyze and consider the Arab League Peace Initiative which offers Israel full normalization of relations with the Arab world and is widely viewed in Israel and around the world as an important opportunity and a real basis for negotiations that could end the Israeli-Arab conflict. While not perfect, this plan sets the table for fruitful negotiations and a final resolution of the conflict. 
   We must also consider negotiations with Syria. If successful, such negotiations could have significant positive impact with respect to limiting Iran's sphere of influence, calming the situation in Lebanon, weakening the support network for Hamas and Hezbollah, and delivering real security to Israel on its northern border. 
   We must call on President Bush to invest in serious, sustained, and effective efforts to improve the security situation on the ground today and re-establish a viable peace process that can deliver peace and security to Israel, and international acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I call on all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 152, and I pledge to continue to work to maintain Jerusalem as Israel's indivisible capitol and to promote the policy of the United States to support a peaceful, two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 422, which calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan. I traveled to Darfur in February 2006. I will never forget what I saw, nor will I relent in my work to end the ongoing genocide. 
   China, if it chose to, could play a critical role in ending the genocide in Darfur. The President's Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew S. Natsios, has said that ``China's substantial economic investment in Sudan gives it considerable potential leverage, and we have made clear to Beijing that the international community will expect China to be part of the solution.'' China has a close relationship with the Government of Sudan, economically and militarily. It purchases 70 percent of Sudan's oil. China has agreed to cancel nearly $100 million if Sudan's debt to the country, and it has invested over $10 million in the Sudanese energy sector over the last two decades. China, already the main supplier of arms to Sudan with $83 million exported there in 2005, recently agreed to cooperate more closely militarily ``in every sphere.'' 
   With this resolution we are asking China to acknowledge and condemn the violence taking place in Darfur, Sudan. Additionally, we are calling on China to cease all military arms and equipments sales to Sudan. Finally, we are strongly encouraging China to suspend economic ties to Sudan until the Government of Sudan stops attacking civilians, complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters into peace negotiations with rebel groups. China has the ability to end the genocide and horror. I hope it chooses to act immediately. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important resolution.

Why? Because, he said, ``of his middle name and because of who his father was.'' 
   Senator Obama, like all of us in this House, swore on the Bible to defend our country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has done nothing to warrant this attack. He has served his country honorably in the U.S. Senate. This attack on his patriotism, religion, heritage, and middle name amount to nothing more than a smear campaign. 
   I would fully expect these comments to come from people like Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter, not from one of my House colleagues. There is simply no room in this country for remarks like these, remarks that Mr. King declares he stands by.

The other body doesn't seem to appear to embrace Vice President Cheney as one of its own. The Vice President can't have it both ways. This amendment helps him sort it out.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, 9 million children in this country lack health insurance coverage, so it shouldn't come as a big surprise that 91 percent of voters support extending to SCHIP coverage to 5 million more children. That is 5 million more children according to the Congressional Budget Office, and that Governors from both sides of the aisle are supporting this legislation across the country. 
   The real surprise is that our President has threatened to veto this bill, a bill to cover children and to improve Medicare for our Nation's seniors and for people with disabilities. My question is, why are the President and so many of our colleagues saying ``no'' to basic health care to children, for adequate payments to doctors, for protecting Medicare? 
   In yesterday's New York Times, I think Paul Krugman hit the nail on the head when he said that President Bush must fear the intent of this bill, which is to cover more children, because he fears that it actually might work. That if America sees government helping children, they will wonder why we can't do the same for everyone. 
   The President said he opposes expanding children's health care because it will hurt private insurance companies. Astounding. Forget uninsured kids. The President is the champion of insurance companies. 
   And people across the aisle are saying it is really about seniors when they are talking about the Medicare Advantage programs. But let's be clear. The Medicare Advantage HMOs are reaping overpayments of up to 40 percent. The overpayments are being subsidized by 80 percent of the seniors and disabled people who are not in Medicare Advantage plans through higher part B premiums. 
   I want to urge the former Speaker of the House to cease giving patently false information about the Illinois SCHIP program which insures far more children than their parents. 
   Let's be on the side of children.

   When the categories of people that are named in this bill were picked, it wasn't sort of a capricious or random or even a liberal bias sort of thing, that we want to support certain people or single them out.

And we are talking about people who are victims of assault, of brutal attacks, of torture, or even of murder. 
   You can say it as many times as you want. This is not about thought. This is not about speech. This is about violence. And you or your pastor may not agree with homosexuals or transgenders, but surely you don't think that is a reason for them to be assaulted. 
   Support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, Stephanie and I were in the same class. We came in in 1998, and immediately bonded as friends and classmates. She and my husband became very good friends. We would joke about it that my husband, Bob, was her boyfriend, and at their last conversation, it ended with his saying, ``Love you, Stef,'' and her saying, ``Love you, Bob.'' I'm jealous of that because they had that moment where they actually said the word that I feel so much tonight, that I loved Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Stephanie was a force of nature. She was a big woman and she filled a room. I can just picture her now. Can't you just picture her coming down and speaking from this podium right now and just filling the space with her presence, with her sense of justice, with her passion, and with, of course, her smile? Stephanie was fiercely loyal. She was a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's. Some of us were on the other side, but that didn't challenge our friendship. 
   Connie Schultz, who is a Pulitzer Prize winner for the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, ``Our friendship was forged by her to the bones understanding of what it means to be a woman, willing to stick your neck out for your beliefs.'' 
   Stephanie was fearless and she was loved. I loved her. I love you, Stephanie.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank my friend Mr. Price for bringing this important legislation to the floor and would like to thank Chairman Conyers, Subcommittee Chairman Scott and the Judiciary Committee for their hard work on this very important issue. 
   My amendment would simply require the Department of Justice to issue descriptions of all charges that have been brought against contractors and contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan and a description of the legal actions taken by the U.S. Government against them as a result of those charges. 
   H.R. 2740 requires the Department of Justice to issue a report that contains a list and descriptions of investigations that it is conducting into possible violations of U.S. law committed by contract personnel. This report must list the number of complaints it's received, the number of investigations it's begun, the number of criminal cases it has opened and the result of those cases. 
   My amendment would expand that requirement a bit further to ensure that the report includes a description of the charges that have been brought against contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and a description of the legal action taken as a result of those charges. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. First, I would like to thank my colleague from Virginia for his support of the amendment and just close with these remarks. 
   U.S. taxpayers have paid billions to private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe that Congress must know if they are engaging in criminal behavior that puts the U.S. Armed Forces and our mission at risk, and what the government is doing to address it. 
   Congress and the American people are beginning to understand the vast impact that contractors are playing in our military operations. These private contractors are not, right now, accountable to the military, but their actions often put our brave military men and women at risk. 
   Currently, the U.S. military is using an estimated 180,000 private contractors in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many are performing duties that are often considered inherently governmental functions, such as military operations, intelligence gathering, law enforcement, security and criminal justice functions. But despite the critical role that contractors are playing, Congress is unable to determine the full impact of contractors on U.S. military operations. 
   We have all heard about the tragic incident in Iraq on September 16 when Blackwater employees reportedly killed 11 Iraqi civilians, and another unconscionable incident on Christmas Eve 2006 when a drunk Blackwater guard killed an Iraqi security guard for the Iraqi Vice President. He was flown out of the country within 36 hours and has faced no charge or punishment for his crime.  
   We should be outraged that with incidents like these reported prominently in the press, and with the hundreds of thousands of contractors who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, that only two have ever been charged with any crime. 
   I urge support for the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I think the issue of providing health coverage to 10 million children is important enough to give our constituents adequate time to weigh in on it. 
   Let them consider whether they want to spend $7 billion a year to provide health care to 10 million uninsured children, an amount equivalent to 2 1/2 weeks spent on the Iraq war. 
   Insure our children for $7 billion a year? President Bush runs for the veto pen. $10 billion a month for Iraq? The President asks for $190 billion more. 
   I urge my colleagues to take this time to listen to their constituents. Look into the eyes of an uninsured child. That child could be sitting next to yours or your grandchild in school. 
   And remember, unlike the war funding which is all on credit cards, this bill is actually paid for. This is an offer, as someone running for reelection, you can't afford to refuse.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, the deed is done. The President just vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program. He is asking for $190 billion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and yet vetoed $35 billion that would provide health care to 10 million low-income American children over the next 5 years. 
   Let's be perfectly clear. The President is refusing to spend $7 billion a year on children's health while insisting on $10 billion a month in Iraq. The President and Republicans in Congress say that we can't afford this bill, but where were the fiscal conservatives when the President demanded hundreds of billions of dollars for the war in Iraq? He along with many of the Republicans in Congress are willing to throw these hundreds of billions of dollars into a disastrous war, and yet when it comes to providing health care to children, they say we don't have the money. 
   The truth is we do have the money and, in fact, the children's health bill is fully paid for, unlike the half a trillion dollars we have already spent on this war. 
   It is time for us to say you are either for covering uninsured American children or you are with a President who prefers to spend this money on an endless war.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. I am an original cosponsor of this bill because I believe it is time that we end gender discrimination in the workplace. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act addresses one of the most evident and detrimental aspects of gender discrimination: Wage disparity. As we know from the U.S. Census Bureau, women across the country earn, on average, only 77 cents for every dollar a man receives for the same work. That 23-cent difference can add up to between $400,000 and $2 million over a working lifetime. In Illinois, where the average working woman earns 75 cents for every dollar earned by a man, the wage gap and the cost to women are even larger. 
   In today's economy, wage discrimination hits women particularly hard, whether they are the heads of households or the second or even third wage earner in a family. With higher food, energy, health care, transportation and housing costs, women are struggling to stretch every dollar in order to meet their family's needs. Wage discrimination unfairly shrinks those dollars, especially for women of color and self-employed women who suffer from a higher-than-average wage gap. It deprives women of dollars that they have earned but, because of the paycheck gap, do not get. 
   While there are many economic arguments for H.R. 1338, there are other considerations as well. I urge my colleagues to consider the views of the American Psychological Association, which argues that wage discrepancies create economic disadvantages that ``affect the psychological and physical health of women and their families.'' As the APA says, ``The link between depression and low-income women can be attributed to increased stress caused by living in poverty, as well as minimal social support. Additionally, low-income pregnant women receive less prenatal care, and are more likely to deliver low-birth weight babies.'' 
   We should pass H.R. 1338 to ensure that women are fairly paid for their work, not economically disadvantaged because of their gender. We should pass H.R. 1338 because it will help families deal with the current economic crisis. We should pass H.R. 1338 because it will have positive health impacts for women and families. It is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, today is an important day in that we are going to hear the anticipated progress report, so-called, by General Petraeus, who will be testifying in a short while before the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, and the case that is going to be made is that there has been just enough progress to warrant staying the course in Iraq. 
   On August 6, I was in Iraq. What I learned from that visit that day was that in fact that the President's surge has failed and that there is no end in sight for the war in Iraq. I learned that first by talking with the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq that day who said that the night before that former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi had pulled his people out of the Parliament, and the week before the Sunnis had left, and then what was remaining of the Parliament was on vacation. And he said that there wasn't going to be any political settlement by this September, nor would there be by next September, and he didn't say which September. 
   The point of that is the reason for the surge was promoted by the President and by General Petraeus as creating the space for political settlements in Iraq, which have not only not happened but we have even seen steps backwards. But what is really important today is that people examine the so-called evidence that progress has been made, and that is why I brought a few charts here. 
   The first one says, is there really less violence in Iraq? Let's look at what is counted, but, even more importantly, what isn't counted. 
   In the evidence that progress has been made, not counted includes Shiite on Shiite violence which is happening in the south in the Basra area, Sunni on Sunni violence. Car bombings aren't counted. And get this one, this isn't a joke. People shot in the front of the head are not counted; people shot in the back of the head are counted. I thought at first that was just an exaggerated joke. It is true. And, finally, the large-scale bombing like the one that killed 500 ethnic Yazidies in August is not counted. So clearly these numbers are very clearly cherry picked. 
   Then, if you look at a fact that is important to many Americans, every month in 2007, including the months, of the surge has seen more U.S. military casualties than the same month in 2006. In other words, more and more of our young men are dying. And while the Parliament was on vacation as some commentators said because, after all, it is so hot, about 120 degrees, our young men and women were fighting and dying in their body armor and helmets and heavy packs and weapons out in that 120 degree heat, dying at numbers greater than ever. 
   And, of course, not included in those numbers has been not only the the number of U.S. troops that have died, but the dollars that have been spent. These are the dollars that we know about right now. Per year, not overall in the war, but per year $120 million; per month $10 million. Actually, I have heard $12 million is the new number. Per week, over $2 million. Per day, $329,000. Per hour, we are doing this for 1 hour right now, almost $14 million an hour. And over $228,000, almost $229,000 a minute is being spent in Iraq. And yet, the political reconciliation which was the goal of expanding the numbers of troops that we have in Iraq has not achieved that; that it has actually gone backwards. And so right now I think what we are seeing is a dog and pony show. 
   The good news is that a lot of people, unlike the lead-up to the war in the first place, aren't buying it. The front page of U.S.A. Today records 60 percent of Americans seek a date for a pullout: Public wary of report on Iraq, polls show. And there have been many other reports. The Jones report that says it is not working. 
   Check the information and be skeptical about the progress. Let's get out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR SECURE ELECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5036, the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008. 
   I think everyone in the chamber today remembers the frustration and disbelief we all felt in November 2000 as hundreds of volunteers poured into Dade County Florida to oversee the recount of the Presidential election. As the future of our nation swayed in the balance, we all thought to ourselves, Can this actually be happening in America? 
   The answer, unfortunately, was yes. As devastating as that event was, I think we learned two very important lessons. The first is that every vote really does count. Every person who is eligible must get to the polls. The second lesson learned is that our system of elections is broken. Changes must be mandated, improvements must be made. 
   That is why I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5036. This bill takes real steps to improve the transparency and accuracy of electoral process by minimizing the financial burden placed on local governments to ensure the accuracy of election results. 
   H.R. 5036 fully reimburses jurisdictions that choose to offer paper ballots on Election Day. In the 2006 election cycle, we learned that electronic voting machines are not always reliable, often malfunctioning and creating substantial complications on Election Day. H.R. 5036 also subsidizes manual recounts of elections results if basic minimum requirements are met. We must provide resources to the states to ensure that the elections they conduct are fair and accurate. 
   Both provisions provide absolutely necessary funding to alleviate the significant burden placed on local and county governments when holding elections. This relief is critical to ensure that local government entities can protect the legitimacy of election results without enduring financial hardship. 
   While, I recognize the fact that more must be done, I also believe that this bill is a very good start and I want to commend my good friend and colleague, RUSH HOLT, for his leadership on this issue. Even a month ago, it appeared that passing this bill was impossible. However, thanks to Representative Holt's tireless efforts to work with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, that impossibility becomes reality today. America will be a better for place for his efforts on this Issue.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 240 which would help open access to the Holocaust archives located at Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   Sixty-two years after the end of the Second World War, the Holocaust archives located in Bad Arolsen remain the largest closed World War Two-era archives in the world. While access to individual records may be requested by Holocaust survivors and their families, many who have requested information in the past reported facing significant delays. These millions of extensive records continue to remain inaccessible to researches. 
   In order to allow for open access to the archives, each of the 11 members of the International Commission of the International Tracing Services must ratify the May 2006 amendments to the Bonn Accords. Deplorably, the majority of the member countries of the International Commission have yet to ratify these amendments. To date, the amendments have only been publicly ratified by 4 out of the 11 Commission member countries. That is why it is important that we are passing H. Res. 240 today. 
   The 110th Congress has recently recognized Holocaust Remembrance Day, and I am pleased that we are continuing our efforts to ``never forget''. My district, the 9th Congressional District of Illinois, is home to the largest concentration of survivors in the State of Illinois and perhaps in the country, and the opening of the Bad Arolsen Archive holds deep meaning for those individuals and the entire community. Perhaps the records located there will help these families fill in the blanks in their lives that were shattered by Nazi Germany. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 240, and I urge all of my colleagues to lend it their support.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, this bill, our first in 3 years, will strengthen the oversight of the intelligence community, require reports on the administration's compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act, and reduce the overall number of contractors employed by intelligence agencies. 
   But for me, the most important element of this bill, the main reason I am supporting this conference report, was added just 1 week ago during conference. When the intelligence oversight committees gathered to consider the conference report, we inserted an amendment that would require all intelligence agencies to comply with the U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogations. This would mean no more torture and no more questions about what the CIA is allowed to do behind closed doors. The Army Field Manual is unclassified, and explicitly prohibits waterboarding, use of hoods, electric shocks and mock executions. The military has voluntarily imposed these restrictions upon itself, and now we must impose the same rules on the intelligence community. 
   I'm a new member of the Intelligence Committee. The Speaker called me at the beginning of this session and asked if I would serve my country by joining this important and distinguished group, and I consider my work on this bill to be just that. 
   The intelligence agencies we oversee operate in the shadows, and on the Intelligence Committee, we learn about policies and priorities and problems that no one in the broader public will ever see. Some of these issues are very troubling. Some of them keep me up at night. 
   The question of interrogation techniques is one of the most important I've dealt with on the committee, and I'm gratified we're having this debate today in a public forum. 
   My colleagues in the minority complain that the inclusion of this provision will make it impossible for our intelligence officers to protect the American people from terrorists. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I assure you that those claims are false. But don't take my word for it. Please consider the advice of General David Petraeus, who said in a May 10 memo to the members of the Armed Forces that the Army Field Manual allowed intelligence officials to get the information they need. Among the things he said is, quote, ``our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual on human intelligence collector operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' 
   If we don't pass this bill with this provision, how can we assume the moral authority to criticize Burma or any other nation for its treatment of prisoners? 
   In the end, we have hurt our own country and undermined the real source of our strength, the rule of law and the sanctity of our Constitution. We're fighting for the soul of our country today. I urge the adoption of this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FOOD STAMP CHALLENGE -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Last week I accepted the Food Stamp Challenge, living for the past week on the average food stamp benefit of $1 per meal or $21 for the entire week. 
   I did it in order to draw attention to the persistent problem of hunger in America. I didn't realize just how hard it would be, but on my first shopping trip to Safeway, I quickly found out. It was hard enough to buy basic staples, but once I got to the produce section, it was impossible to buy much of anything. There was no way to eat a nutritious diet. Fruits and vegetables were simply out of my price range. 
   For me, it was a learning experience. For 26 million Americans and 1.2 million Illinoisans, it is a way of life. I wonder how parents on food stamps can stretch their budgets so their children have enough to eat or how seniors with chronic illness afford both eating nutritious meals and purchasing adequate medication. The answer for many is they simply can't. 
   In the richest country in the world, the fact that families face these sort of trade-offs is unjust and I would say it's immoral. The United States is spending merely $3 billion each week in Iraq, yet we expect hungry Americans to eat on $3 a day? 
   We need to pass Representatives JIM MCGOVERN's and JO ANN EMERSON's Feeding America's Families Act which would strengthen America's anti-hunger safety net programs, including food stamps, at a reasonable and affordable cost of about $4 billion per year. These are the kinds of provisions that ought to be part of the farm bill which includes the food stamp program. 
   I just ended this challenge yesterday. I am looking forward to a big salad for lunch where I include all kinds of vegetables at the salad bar that's in the cafeteria, adding whatever I want to that salad rather than having to carefully pick and choose what I had last week, which was one head of lettuce and one tomato and a few carrots, and that was about it. My snacks were water and, on a good moment, ice water. 
   It was an interesting and instructive week for me, but imagining my children and grandchildren having to live that way made it very, very clear to me that this really ought not to be a forced option for so many millions of Americans. 
   We can do better. This is a matter of priorities. We can change those priorities. We can make sure that with pride we say that no one in this country goes hungry, that everyone in this country at least has the opportunity to make healthy choices about the food that they eat and the food that they serve their children. 
   How can a child learn in school when they come without an adequate breakfast? How can they achieve in life without the nutrition that they need as their bones are growing and as their minds are growing? I am very hopeful that the experiment that I did with Congressmen MCGOVERN and EMERSON and TIM RYAN will prove to be helpful in making sure that we are able to pass more humane, and important to all Americans, legislation that will provide nutritious and affordable food for all of our residents in the United States.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN HEART MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me on this important issue. 
   On December 30, 1963, Congress requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month. House Concurrent Resolution 52, supporting the goals and ideals of American Heart Month, reaffirms the Federal Government's commitment to fighting heart disease, recognizes Americans struggling with this illness, and encourages Americans to take preventive measures to protect themselves from heart disease.     
   I want to recognize the sponsor of this resolution, Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, and thank her for her leadership on this and other critical health issues. 
   Over 79 million, or one in three, American adults have cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and congenital cardiovascular defects. 
   The lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease for an individual aged 40 is two in three of men, and over one in two for women. 
   Cardiovascular disease was the underlying cause of death for well over a third of all the 2.4 million deaths in the United States in 2004. Cardiovascular disease accounts for more deaths than any other single cause of death in the United States. Nearly 2,400 Americans die of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of one death each 36 seconds. 
   The estimated direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease in 2007 are $431.8 billion. Heart disease is a significant factor in driving up medical costs in the United States. About two-thirds of unexpected cardiac deaths occur without prior recognition of cardiac disease. 
   This is an important point to underscore, and it highlights the need for American Heart Month. Public education can help raise awareness, encourage preventive measures, discourage unhealthy behaviors and persuade more Americans to get regular medical exams. By doing so, we will be able to reduce the incidences of heart disease. 
   We can lower those numbers that I have just mentioned, but we can also improve and extend the lives of real people, our family members, friends and neighbors. That is what American Heart Month is all about. 
   We know the risk factors that lead to heart disease: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity and diabetes. 
   Cigarette smoking results in a two- to threefold increased risk of dying from coronary heart disease. 
   We also know the way to manage risk and prevent heart disease: regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight; healthy eating habits; avoidance of tobacco, drugs and excessive alcohol; getting regular checkups to be screened for signs of heart disease risk. 
   American Heart Month is particularly important in getting the word out to those who are disproportionately affected by heart disease and who too often fail to receive the treatment they need. Women and minorities may have atypical symptoms when suffering a heart attack or angina, and if they are sent home undiagnosed, they are about twice as likely to die from these symptoms as those who are admitted. 
   Heart disease is the number one killer of women in this country, claiming over 349,000 American women each year. Raising awareness and improving treatment and screening can save many lives. 
   Forty-two percent of women who have heart attacks die within 1 year, compared with 24 percent of men. This may be because, on average, women are older than men when they have a heart attack. It also may be because heart disease is not typically diagnosed as or treated as aggressively as that in men. 
   Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, is the number one killer of women in the United States. Experts estimate that one in two will die of heart disease or stroke, compared with one in 25 of women who will die of breast cancer.  
   Existing heart disease is undiagnosed in half of women who have a first heart attack. 
   Management of chest pains differ by sex and race. Men are more likely than women to receive definitive diagnoses of angina as opposed to vague chest pain. Women and blacks typically receive fewer cardiovascular medications than men and whites. 
   Lack of studies on women limits usefulness of research on coronary heart disease. Although CHD causes more than 250,000 deaths in women each year, much of the research on CHD in the last 20 years has either excluded women or included very few women. As a result, many of the tests and therapies used to treat women for CHD are based on studies conducted predominantly in men and may not be as effective in women. 
   Again, I want to thank Representative Millender-McDonald for her leadership, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 52.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the RESTORE Act because I believe that the way we conduct the fight against terrorism says a great deal about who we are as a people. 
   We all want to keep the country safe from terrorism and to provide the necessary tools to our intelligence community, but I am not willing to sacrifice who we are and what we stand for just because this President says so. 
   The President's Protect America Act cut the FISA Court out of the process. The RESTORE Act puts the court back in. Now, the court, not the President, will decide whether the constitutional legal requirements are met. The court will assess in advance a program of surveillance that may intercept the communications of Americans. The court will ensure that the system the NSA establishes will protect the rights of any Americans they come across. The RESTORE Act clarifies the Protect America Act cannot be used to conduct secret searches of Americans' homes, businesses, computers, and medical records. It reiterates the exclusivity of FISA, which would put an end to secret, warrantless spying programs. It makes clear that the President has to obey the laws. 
   The RESTORE Act requires meaningful reporting to the Congress about the warrantless surveillance programs that have occurred since September 11, and it will require meaningful oversight in the future. The RESTORE Act will make America safer and keeps us true to who we are as a Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman RUSH for yielding to  me and for your support. I also want to extend my appreciation to Chairman Dingell whose assistance and guidance were critical in bringing this important bill, H.R. 1216, the Cameron Gulbransen Transportation Safety Act, to the floor today. 
   One of the most painful things I've been a part of as a Member of Congress are the press conferences which come about every 6 months or so in which parents and grandparents come to share pictures of their children and loved ones, some of whom they have accidentally killed by rolling over them with their vehicles. Imagine that for a moment, particularly in this time of year, as we wish to be with those we love the most. 
   I am here today because of these courageous people, driven by such horrifying accidents. Today we can pass this bill and reduce these unimaginably tragic and unnecessary deaths and make them a thing of the past. At just 2 years of age, Cameron Gulbransen was tragically killed when his father, a pediatrician from Long Island, accidentally backed over him. This bill is a tribute to him and the hundreds of other young children who have died. 
   This legislation was first introduced back in 2003 with my colleague from New York, Congressman PETER KING, whose constituent is Dr. Gulbransen. But today I stand here with strengthened resolve. Just 2 days ago as her mother picked up snow shovels that had been left in the driveway, Ashlynn Lauber, an 8-year-old from just outside Collinsville, Illinois, my State, was killed when the family car rolled over her. 
   Unfortunately, since we first introduced H.R. 1216, well over 1,000 children have needlessly died in preventable accidents, and this year alone 200 children have died of back-over accidents. Many children are killed in these kinds of accidents each year without ever leaving their driveways, suffocated by unsafe power windows, backed over by cars with major blind spots, or hit because a car was accidentally put into motion by a child who could not control it. 
   H.R. 1216 is commonsense, consensus legislation that reflects input from the auto industry as well as child safety advocates. This legislation will require the Secretary of Transportation to set minimum safety standards for cars, SUVs and trucks, and to begin rule-making in three areas: Expanding rearward visibility, enabling power windows to automatically reverse direction when an obstruction is detected, and requiring brake pedals to be engaged when a vehicle is not in park. 
   Expanding the rearward visibility standard will give drivers a better means of detecting when small children or objects are behind their vehicles. Some SUVs have rearward visibility so poor that up to 62 children could fit in their blind spot with the driver being none the wiser. This provision will enable drivers to detect areas behind motor vehicles and will help reduce deaths and injuries from backing incidents, particularly for children and the disabled. 
   Instructing the Secretary to consider requiring power windows to automatically reverse direction when an obstruction is detected will help prevent small children from being caught in or strangled by windows. These accidents have taken a minimum of 21 lives over the last 5 years. 
   And finally, requiring every vehicle's brake pedal to be engaged when the car is shifted out of ``park'' and into another gear will prevent anyone not intending to drive the car, such as a child who cannot typically reach the brake pedal, from accidentally setting the car into motion. In the past 5 years, at least 80 children have lost their lives in this kind of accident. 
   Families want safe cars. They deserve these commonsense safety features. It is time that we make sure they get them. And one of the best parts of this bill is that it will direct the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to create a publicly searchable database of nontraffic, noncrash-related motor vehicle injuries and to establish a child safety information program to help consumers address ways in which parents and caregivers can reduce risks to small children. 
   Better design and technologies already exist, and they are getting better and cheaper every day. Many companies already offer these added safety features on their higher end vehicles, but protecting our children is not a luxury to be priced out of reach for most Americans. It is time that manufacturers include these features in every vehicle. 
   I'd like to publicly thank Kids and Cars and the Consumers Union for strenuously advocating for the safety of children and for taking on the critical problem of unsafe cars. And I, again, want to thank Chairman Dingell, Mr. Barton and Mr. Stearns for their efforts. And I would like to thank Jonathan Cordone and David Cavicke on the committee staff for all their hard work on this bill. I also want to extend a special thanks to Congressman PETER KING for his leadership and resolve that he's demonstrated over the years. 
   And finally, I want to thank Diane Beedle, my former legislative director, who worked tirelessly on this issue, and the families who have turned their tragedies into advocacy.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Thank you, Congresswoman Watson, for organizing this and allowing me to participate tonight. I also want to thank our colleague, Representative Conyers, for his long-time passionate leadership on universal health care. I don't know if he is going to get here tonight, but he certainly has been a steady and consistent voice for health care and health care reform. Thanks to his efforts and that of so many others, I believe we are on the brink of accomplishing this long-awaited goal, and that this time we will be successful in providing affordable, guaranteed health coverage for all Americans. 
   When I first ran for office in 1990 for the State legislature, I proclaimed that as my goal in public service, that one day to be able to contribute to the victory of allowing all Americans to receive health coverage. I have always felt that this richest nation in the world, that it is a shame and really an embarrassment that Americans, unlike citizens and residents of every other industrialized nation in the world, that we don't make health care accessible to all of our citizens. It is unacceptable and in many ways un-American. It is not in the tradition of our country, which is to take care of each other. 
   There are lots of people across the country who are ready to make this fight. Another one of the heroes I wanted to highlight tonight is my friend and until recently when he retired from active practice my physician, my personal physician, Dr. Quentin Young of Chicago. Quentin Young was the chairman of medicine at Cook County Hospital. He was the president of the American Public Health Association. He is a founder of Health and Medicine Policy Research Group in Chicago, and a co-founder of the Physicians For a National Health Program. And in each of his roles, expanding access to quality health care has been his top priority. He is one of the most articulate and passionate and consistent long-term spokespeople for single payer health care in our country, for providing affordable, comprehensive and quality health care for all. 
   And as Dr. Young frequently says, ``We feel universal health care is no longer the best answer, it is the only answer. There was a time when there were alternatives that might have worked, but that day is passed.'' 
   He goes on to say, ``I certainly think it is attainable. It has been attained in certain countries that aren't very different from us. I totally come down on the side of health care being a human right. It is very hard for me to see a coherent let alone a moral or decent argument against it because illness doesn't distribute itself according to the ability to care for yourself and be cared for. It strikes children. It strikes the poor. It strikes the most needy, and the most ill-protected disproportionately. That is the correlation.'' 
   Cardinal Bernardin, also from Chicago, a hero on health care, said it best. He said, ``Health care is so important to human life and dignity that it is the responsibility of society to offer access to decent health care to every person.'' 
   And I was pleased that he didn't say every citizen. He said every person. So the answer is that it should be considered a right guaranteed by society, which means it must be a responsibility of government.  
   And as we enter this new round of discussions, more and more people and organizations have come to agree with Dr. Young and JOHN CONYERS' conclusions. New coalitions have formed, including small and big businesses, consumer and labor groups, providers and the faith community, and organizations representing people with disabilities and living with chronic diseases. The time has come for action. 
   In 2002, the Institutes of Medicine estimated that 18,000 people a year died because they were uninsured. They were unable to afford preventive services, screenings that would have provided early warnings, prescription drugs or medical care. Today the Urban Institute estimates that annual death from uninsurance are up to 22,000 people every year. That is 432 people each week, 60 people each and every day who die because the United States of America alone in the industrialized world does not guarantee affordable health care to our people. It is a horrendous statistic. 
   But it is only a partial description of the catastrophes we face. Our health care system is becoming completely dysfunctional for patients and for those who care for them. 
   Even being covered by insurance is no guarantee. The Commonwealth Fund has just released a new study that concludes between 2003 and 1997, the number of uninsured Americans grew by 60 percent. There are now 25 million insured people who could face financial catastrophe if they become sick or injured. 
   Consider this: One in five Americans under the age of 65, many of them insured, live with medical debt. I say under 65 because many people are waiting for that birthday, can't wait to get there because then finally Medicare, a national health insurance for people over 65 and those with disabilities who qualify, do get health care.     
   Medical bills are the leading cause of about half of all personal bankruptcies. High deductibles and co-pays, limits on payments, denials of needed care, all of these shift burdens to individuals and families who are already struggling. These numbers are staggering, and it's a national shame that while spending 50 percent more than any other country in the world on health care, we fall so dismally short in providing a health care guarantee. 
   But it's also important to remember that behind each number is a person, our friends, our neighbors, our family, our colleagues, ourselves; people like the Wells family from Illinois, who accumulated over $175,000 in medical expenses while waiting for their employer's 6-month waiting period for coverage to expire. 
   Or Susan, who can't afford the tests her doctor wants her to have to deal with her high blood pressure; or Constance, who moved back to Illinois to care for a family member and can't find a job that provides affordable benefits. 
   I want to close by saying that winning the fight for guaranteed health care for all is not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. Too many potential entrepreneurs are locked into jobs that provide health care, unable to leave and create new businesses that keep our economy strong and provide new jobs. 
   Too many businesses that are providing coverage for their workers are competitively disadvantaged because their foreign competitors operate in countries with national health care. They too want us to get it together and adopt universal health care. 
   So, again, I want to thank Congresswoman Watson and again, I want to thank Congressman Conyers for his leadership.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank Congressman Wynn for his effort to bring this critical resolution to the floor today. I'm glad to be here to speak out in strong support of H. Con. Res. 302, a resolution to recognize March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. 
   My family and my life, like so many others, have been touched by someone with cancer. Two and a half years ago, after fighting courageously for a year, my amazing daughter-in-law, Fiona, died of colorectal cancer, leaving behind two young children, a husband and many loving family members and friends. At 38 years old, she died, not having a screening, and though, in retrospect, she had symptoms. Too many of us have either struggled with cancer ourselves or know of someone who has. 
   I recently saw a new study from the CDC saying that colorectal cancer testing has risen steadily since 2002, and this is very encouraging news. But another study that appeared in the Journal CANCER at the end of last year is extremely troubling to me. It shows a significant underuse of colorectal cancer screening procedures among Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, only 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries received recommended screening.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. In fact, only 25 percent of Medicare patients received recommended screening during the study period. 
   We have to do better. We must work to expand public education and understanding of the benefits of screening. Congress needs to make it a priority to reduce the amount of out-of-pocket-costs associated with cancer screening to ensure that those who may be at risk of developing colorectal cancer get screened. And as the richest country in the world, we need to act to make sure that everyone gets the medical care they need. 
   You've heard the statistics. If caught early the survival rate is 90 percent; if not, it's only 10 percent. 
   Through the establishment of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month we will add to the over one million colorectal cancer survivors living in America today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this wonderful resolution, and I thank the gentleman for introducing it.

I also want to thank Energy and Commerce Chair JOHN DINGELL and the Health Subcommittee Chairman Frank Pallone, as well as Chairmen RANGEL and STARK of the Ways and Means Committee for their continued leadership. 
   Last year, we passed the CHAMP bill to prevent a 10.6 percent cut in payments to Medicare providers and to make critical improvements, and today we are trying again. This bill would prevent physician payment cuts in 2008 and provide an increase in 2009. And, something of particular concern to me, it would address the cuts to mental health providers that have already taken place. 
   While we need to do more, we have to act now. And there are many, many reasons to support the passage of this bill. It provides mental health parity. It expands access to low-income assistance for seniors and people with disability struggling to pay their health care costs. It extends the moratorium on physical therapy caps. It eliminates cuts to oxygen treatment and wheelchairs. It postpones competitive bidding for durable medical equipment. On the diabetes front, it includes a 2-year reauthorization of the special diabetes program, prompt pay requirements for pharmacies, and on and on. 
   If you think it is more important to continue excess payments to private Medicare Advantage plans, plans that are getting 13 percent more than Medicare, you should vote no. In 2008, this meant that Medicare Advantage plans saw a 6 percent increase, while physicians are scheduled for a 10.6 percent cut. Next year, Medicare Advantage plans will see between a 5 and 7 percent increase, while physicians are scheduled for a 5 percent cut. But if you think it is more important to prevent Medicare cuts to physicians and providers and to help senior citizens and persons with disabilities, then you will vote yes. 
   I hope that all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will make the right choice. I hope you will side with Medicare physicians and their patients and pass H.R. 6331.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, the Congress named the humanitarian crisis in Darfur as genocide. Naming is really important, because once we've acknowledged the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives that have been lost there, we have a responsibility to act. And yet the disastrous crisis continues on today. 
   I visited Darfur. I've seen the situation on the ground. And now the high-tech GPS satellites and mass media allow everyone to bear witness to the tragedies in Darfur; the burnt holes where villages used to be, the mass migrations of internally displaced, starving children, victims of rape. 
   I want to thank the student groups, the faith organizations and the Americans around the country who have worked to raise this issue's profile and to keep Darfur on the agenda. 
   Last month, the Sudanese Government allowed a combined U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force. The Democratic majority approved $949 million in humanitarian aid, but we have to go further. Let this be the last time we mark the anniversary of genocide.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, as you know, bringing accountability and transparency to contracting has been a priority of mine, and I have worked to ensure that companies that we award contracts to are held responsible for any abuses. I believe we must make certain that the intelligence community is not using U.S. taxpayer dollars to enter into or renew contracts with companies that may be engaging in serious abuses of law and violence toward civilians and whose actions go unpunished. 
   Around the world our country is contracting with private companies that employ individuals who do not wear the badge of the United States but whose behavior has, on numerous occasions, severely damaged the credibility and security of our military and harmed our relationship with other governments. Perhaps the most egregious example came on September 16, 2007, when private security contractors employed by Blackwater Worldwide killed 17 civilians and wounded many more in downtown Baghdad. No one has been held accountable for this. 
   At a minimum, we need a more transparent process to hold private contractors accountable and more information in order to understand their impact on our Intelligence Community, our armed forces and our larger objectives. 
   I thank the chairman for including language prohibiting the use of contractors for interrogation, as well as a provision requiring a comprehensive report on the use of contractors in the intelligence community. 
   If I may ask the chairman in a brief colloquy if the chairman will work with me to include additional language in the conference report calling for a report that examines the extent of criminal activity among intelligence community contractors and assesses the effects of hiring contracting companies that are responsible for serious legal violations.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, I rise today to address two matters in the intelligence authorization bill. 
   For too long, the intelligence community has been increasing its use of contractors without internal or congressional oversight. For the first time, the Director of National Intelligence has conducted a contractor survey to begin to get a handle on the situation. A simple survey, however, is not sufficient to understand how we are using contractors and whether the use of such contractors is appropriate. 
   This bill takes an important step towards understanding the use of contractors. It requires the DNI Inspector General to report on intelligence contractors committing waste, fraud or abuse. It also requires a report on contractor accountability and their effect on the workforce, all positive steps toward better oversight. 
   But there is one issue this bill does not address that I firmly believe raises a fundamental question as to who we are as a Nation. The President has acknowledged that the intelligence community kept prisoners in undisclosed detention sites and has reserved the right to do so in the future. We should reject this policy. 
   In Nazi Germany, millions of people were sent to camps, never to be heard from again. During the Cold War, thousands of people disappeared into gulags. Saddam Hussein's secret prisons still strike fear into the hearts of Iraqis. Each time, our Nation stood as a beacon of human rights and strongly objected to those practices. If we endorse any policy that allows undisclosed detention, we undermine our moral authority to stand against such atrocities in the future. 
   The United States should be beyond reproach in its treatment of detainees. In the first Gulf War, the International Committee of the Red Cross called U.S. compliance with the Geneva Conventions the best of any nation in any conflict in the history of the convention. 
   If we lower that standard for how we treat prisoners, we weaken our ability to insist on the highest standards of treatment for our own military personnel and civilians abroad, thus endangering their safety and undermining our standing in the world. More importantly, we sacrifice the principles on which this country is based. 
   I want to thank the chairman for considering all these important matters in the intelligence bill and for his leadership on this good bill.

   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I thank him for his leadership on this important amendment. 
   After the Cold War, the use of contractors began to grow, and their use exploded after September 11, 2001. Contractors now do more than just build military equipment and satellites. They also provide security, collect and analyze intelligence, provide technical support, and even perform planning and management tasks. 
   Mr. Price's amendment requires a review of what contractors are doing and, importantly, whether contractors are performing inherently governmental functions. There are some activities so sensitive that, if and when they are done, we must determine whether or not it is appropriate to contract these activities out. 
   In some cases, U.S. contractors' actions have caused great controversy. The Lincoln Group's contract to plant positive news stories in Iraq raised questions about manipulation of the Iraqi media. Dave Passaro, a CIA contractor was convicted of four counts of assaulting an Afghan detainee who later died. Contractors were implicated in the detainee abuse cases at Abu Ghraib. 
   These activities are controversial enough on their own, and if the U.S. engages in them, we should do so while accepting full responsibility and not hide behind contractors. 
   The Price-Schakowsky amendment would ask the DNI to review whether it is appropriate for contractors to engage in intelligence collection, analysis, covert actions, interrogations, detentions, rendition or electronic surveillance. 
   This is an important amendment, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (TRADE AND LABOR -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman whose leadership I appreciate so much on this very important issue. You have beautifully filled the footsteps, the shoes, of your predecessor, Congressman Lane Evans, who was also a champion for workers' rights, for the rights of ordinary people. And I appreciate that you are standing up for millions of American workers who have suffered from the trade policies that we have had.     
   I think it is important to note that the new class of Members who joined this Congress, far from being unsophisticated, understand that the trade policies that have been negotiated have harmed their constituents not just in the Rust Belt of the Midwest but around this country and brought those issues to their constituents and, vice versa, listened to their constituents. 
   Look, we all understand that this is a global world, that globalization is a reality, but now we need to control it and this Congress now has to reassert its authority over U.S. trade policy. We have an opportunity to do that now, to make sure that it works not only for the wealthiest multinational corporations but for workers and for our environment. So I appreciate very much the leadership that others have shown, particularly you, Mr. Hare, tonight with this special order. 
   On May 10, 2007, the Bush administration officials and congressional leaders announced a new trade deal. While the agreement does show real progress in terms of moving the Bush administration in the direction of enforcing labor and environmental standards, the details of the negotiated package and their real-life impact are not clear and are troubling. 
   So while I want to applaud the work of Chairman Rangel and others to make major improvements to the labor and environmental provisions, I have to say, frankly, that I have no confidence that the Bush administration, the same administration that has relentlessly attacked the rights of workers right here at home, let alone in other countries, would enforce those standards. 
   We have yet to see the text of the proposed agreements, ``the deal,'' but a detailed description has been made available by the Ways and Means Committee and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and I am concerned that an outdated trade model that has decimated U.S. manufacturing remains intact. 
   Over 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since NAFTA took effect. I think many of those who voted for NAFTA would agree that it has not worked out in favor of the United States and its workers, or Mexican workers either, for that matter. American wages since then have stagnated and our trade deficit has ballooned to a staggering $717 billion. It is not a model we want to mimic. It is no wonder that no union or environmental group or small business has supported the deal, while all of big business has. 
   There are those who suggest that those of us who have serious questions about the deal on trade are just mad about being left out of a press conference or, similarly, are wasting time so we delay the process. But the truth is there are substantive critical issues that affect these millions of Americans that we are speaking for tonight. 
   The deal provides no assurances, for example, against a free trade agreement with Colombia, the country with the world's highest rate of labor union assassinations, or countries like Korea that continue to use every means to block American products, or the renewal of Fast Track trade authority. 
   Instead of delivering on the public's demand for a new trade policy, the deal facilitates more Bush trade deals that contain the worst provisions of NAFTA and CAFTA. Even if the deal is 100 percent implemented, resulting trade pacts would extend the NAFTA-CAFTA model.  
   The deal would ban U.S. efforts to prohibit offshoring jobs and to ban buy-American policies. How could Democrats, who have been fighting to expand and preserve such important U.S. policies, support a trade agreement that explicitly bans those very same policies? 
   The deal does absolutely nothing to address the free trade agreement threats to Federal and State prevailing wage guarantees. Nothing was done. 
   The deal allows the country of Peru to be sued if they dare to reverse its failed social security privatization plan. Seeing that Democrats actually beat back the Bush proposal for privatization of our Social Security plan, Peru's labor federation asked democratic trade leaders to fix this problem. Yet it is unaddressed in this deal. 
   The deal fails to remove the outrageous NAFTA Chapter 11 foreign investor privileges that create incentives for U.S. firms to move offshore and expose our most basic environmental, health, zoning and other laws to attack in foreign tribunals. We won't as a sovereign state even be able to protect those kinds of important laws. 
   The deal does nothing to address FTA- and NAFTA-style agricultural rules that will foreseeably result in widespread displacement of peasant farmers, increasing hunger, social unrest and desperate immigration. We talk about immigration and people crossing our border, and yet we have trade policies that impoverish farmers in Mexico, who quite naturally are going to do anything they can to protect their families and are willing to risk their lives in the desert to come to the United States. Trade is part and should be part of our immigration debate. This deal does absolutely nothing. 
   Mr. Speaker, what I want to say is that this is a moment of opportunity where a Democratic majority in Congress can get a grip on these trade policies to set a new direction that raises all workers around the world, that respects our environment at such a critical moment in history, that really does good, not just for the rights of multinational corporations who show no loyalty to any country but to our workers and hard-working people around the world. 
   We can do better, we should do better, and we have an obligation to our constituents to do better. That is all we are asking for. Let's go back to the drawing boards, not forever, not for an unlimited period of time, but let's go back to the drawing boards and create something that we all can be proud of in this country. 
   Thank you so much, Mr. Hare, for your leadership.

Witnesses call shooting unprovoked, but State Department cleared its security team after a brief probe.'' 
   That shooting took place February 7, and just yesterday we found out about it. Isn't it obvious that the State Department is unable or unwilling to control these armed mercenaries whose reckless behavior fans the flames of hatred against all Americans, including our young troops in harm's way? Isn't it obvious that for-profit companies like Blackwater who are being paid billions of taxpayer dollars have forfeited their right to work in Iraq? Defense Secretary Robert Gates said they are working ``at cross purposes to our larger mission in Iraq.''

   I am also extremely encouraged by provisions in the Senate bill that will play a key role in the development of safe and effective microbicides.

   The poison control centers program has proven to be a very successful program for communities across the country, by providing a national toll-free number for poison emergencies, a national media campaign to promote the use of poison centers, and a poison prevention grant program. 
   In my district alone, the Illinois Poison Center handled 7,021 cases last year. Statewide, 51 percent of the calls the Illinois Poison Center handled involved children under the age of 5. I just can't imagine what families would do without this tremendous resource. Surely, this legislation which will reauthorize this program through 2014 and increase its total authorization to $37.5 million annually will be money well spent. 
   Not only do poison centers save lives, they save time and resources by cost avoidance for patients who are cared for in their homes as  opposed to visiting a hospital and by reducing lengths of stay for patients who are cared for by a poison control center prior to arriving at a hospital. 
   Again, I thank the bill's sponsor and our Chairmen for their work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to give H.R. 5669 their support.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, the day is finally here. Today, the American people will see what this body is really made of and where members stand on the issue of children's healthcare. Is this body willing to stand up to the President and override his veto? Or are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle going to fold like a house of cards and follow this President right off a cliff? 
   The choice is easy--you are either for healthcare for 10 million children or you are not. You can equivocate all you want and come up with an excuse that is politically expedient, but when it comes down to it, there is no way to hide from your vote. 
   When that voting board lights up this afternoon, we will know and remember those who let 10 million children and their families down. The President and most of the Republicans in Congress will tell you that we can't afford this bill, but don't let them fool you. This bill is fully paid for, unlike the half a trillion dollars that we have already spent in Iraq. 
   And keep in mind, the members that vote against this bill today are going to turn right around and vote for $190 billion more dollars for the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, it's the children that end up with the short end of the stick. The children the President is refusing to insure today are the same ones that will be forced to foot the bill for the war in Iraq tomorrow. 
   But you have a chance to make things right today, to set the record straight. You can show your constituents and this country that you care about the millions of uninsured American children more than continuing this disastrous war. 
   Please, don't let these children down. They need your vote. Vote to override this misguided veto.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FAST TRACK TRADE AUTHORITY -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, on June 30, 2007, Fast Track trade authority will expire. Now is the time for Congress to replace an outdated system that removes congressional authority, as set out in the Constitution, ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' 
   As it stands with Fast Track in place, Congress has no control over the content of trade agreements. We can vote on trade agreements only after they have been negotiated and signed, but we are responsible for trade agreements negative effects. Over 3 million American manufacturing jobs have been lost. 
   American wages have stagnated. We have lost our family farms, and we have failed to encourage income equality in the developing nations with which we have trade agreements. That's after Fast Track. 
   Let's replace Fast Track with a better system. Congress should be able to decide with whom we negotiate trade agreements and what goes into those agreements. Let's restore the balance of powers on trade established in the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is a delight to see you in the chair. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, to require Medicare negotiation for lower drug prices, and I thank Chairman Dingell for his leadership. 
   In 2003 the pharmaceutical industry spent over $100 million to lobby Congress, hiring the equivalent of a lobbyist for every Member to protect their interests in the new drug benefit. And they got what they wanted. 
   As the New York Times reported this past November: ``For big drug companies, the new Medicare prescription benefit is proving to be a financial windfall, larger than even the most optimistic Wall Street analysts had predicted.'' 
   One of the main reasons for the drug company windfall is the so-called ``noninterference'' clause, the provision written into the law at the behest of the drug companies prohibiting Medicare from using its bargaining power to negotiate for drug discounts.     
   Just think about it for a minute: Medicare is involved in making sure that prices are reasonable and affordable for every other benefit, from wheelchairs to hospital charges to hospice care. But it is prohibited from doing so for prescription drugs. 
   Other large purchasers, from the VA to State governments to large employers, use their bargaining clout to get affordable prices. But Medicare is prohibited from doing so on behalf of the 40 million seniors and persons with disabilities and the taxpayers who help pay for benefit. 
   This week, Families USA released a study showing that part D prices for the top 20 drugs used by seniors are on average 58 percent higher than prices at the VA. Other studies show that some part D drug prices are as much as 10 times the VA prices, and even higher than the prices available at Costco.com or Drugstore.com. 
   AARP, which operates a part D plan and supported the original bill, wrote to support this bill saying ``plans are not always able to exercise the kind of negotiating leverage that could result from secretarial negotiation.'' 
   In the first 6 months of part D's implementation, drug company profits increased $8 billion. It is time to protect the interests of the American people, not the profits of the drug companies. It is time to pass H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, today's passage of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Act (SERVA) will improve greatly the housing voucher system--which is already successful and has been described by the Administration as one of the federal government's most effective programs. 
   Safe and affordable housing is one of my priorities and should be a national priority. Section 8 vouchers are a great tool for getting families into decent homes. Studies have shown that Section 8 vouchers reduce homelessness, overcrowding, and frequent moves from apartment to apartment. Affordable housing is critical to strong families and communities, and vouchers have allowed families to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods with better schools and less exposure to crime. 
   H.R. 1851 will only increase the success of Section 8 vouchers, which currently provides housing assistance to more than 2 million families, by making the program more efficient and more effective. From 2004 to 2006, voucher funds were allocated using a series of  ineffectual formulas that gave some agencies less funding than they needed to cover the costs of their vouchers--forcing them to cut back for needy families--while other agencies were given more funds than they could use. This resulted in $1.4 billion of unused funds and, more importantly, 150,000 more low-income families without vouchers. SERVA would base funding on the actual cost of each agency's vouchers in the previous year. This will allow housing agencies, apartment owners, and families with vouchers to be confident that the program will be funded on a regular basis. Moreover, SERVA will establish incentives encouraging agencies to serve as many families as their funding permits, rather than accumulating large balances of unspent funds. 
   In addition to establishing such a stable, efficient and equitable voucher funding policy, SERVA will additionally remove barriers to voucher ``portability'', as well as streamline the rules for determining tenants' rent payment. It will authorize 100,000 new vouchers over five years' time, and include provisions to encourage economic self-sufficiency. It will also allow families to use housing vouchers as a down payment on a first-time home purchase, gives a limited number of Public Housing Agencies some flexibility to experiment with development and rent policies, and makes it easier for housing agencies to attach vouchers to housing units. These reforms will provide vital rental assistance for seniors and the disabled as well as low-income families, as well as provide a welcome opportunity for low-income families to achieve the American Dream of home ownership. 
   By reforming an already highly successful program, we can improve the quality of life for many American families, elderly, and disabled citizen all over the country by offering them more and better choices of communities to live in.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, today I will vote for the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. I agree with the 70 percent of Americans who want our troops out of Iraq. And I agree with the comprehensive report called ``Strategic Reset'' from the Center for American Progress, written by three authors, one of whom is Lawrence Korb, former Assistant Secretary of Defense. 
   They write, ``The current Iraq strategy is exactly what al Qaeda wants, the United States distracted and pinned down by Iraq's internal conflicts, trapped in a quagmire that has become the perfect rallying cry and recruitment tool for al Qaeda. The United States has no good options, given the strategic and tactical mistakes made in Iraq since 2002, but simply staying the course with an indefinite military presence is not advancing U.S. interests.'' 
   Today we will vote to change the course to bring our troops home by April of 2008. I will proudly vote in favor of that bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of section 10404 of the 2007 Farm Bill, which would provide $35 million in funding over the next five years for farmers' markets through the Farmer Marketing Assistance Program. This provision also designates that 10 percent of the funding will be used to support the use of Electronic Benefits Transfer, EBT, technology at farmers' markets. I want to thank Representative Kagen for his leadership and his amendment to the bill that strengthens our nation's farmers' markets and provides much needed resources for food stamp recipients to use their benefits at farmers' markets. I also appreciate his working with me on this issue. 
   As someone who regularly shops at a farmers' market in my hometown of Evanston, IL, I have seen first hand that farmers' markets are a positive force wherever they crop up, providing consumers with fresh food options, preserving family farms, increasing health and nutrition and connecting urban and rural Americans. Direct marketing of farm products has ballooned in recent years from 1,755 farmers markets in 1994 to over 4,385 in 2006. These markets average $245,000 per year in revenue, with the typical farmer netting about $7,108. Even though farmers' markets are highly seasonal, 25 percent of vendors rely on them as their sole source of farm-based income. 
   Even as farmers' markets are expanding to unprecedented numbers, the 2006 USDA Farmers' Market Survey found that only 6 percent of these markets have implemented EBT technology. In my home city of Chicago, we only have one farmers' market that can accept EBT cards: the Logan Square market became the first farmers' market in Illinois just last month. However, at a time when obesity, food insecurity and chronic illnesses impact millions of low-income Americans, most still cannot use their food stamp benefits to purchase nutritious food at farmers' markets. 
   This past May, I participated in the Food Stamp Challenge and lived on the national average food stamp benefit for one week. Even though the $3 per day allotment was inadequate, I had the good fortune of access to nearby grocery stores. Millions of Americans, however, have no grocery stores near their homes and live in what are known as ``food deserts.'' In fact, a 2004 study by Mississippi State University found that in the midwest, 34 percent of Americans live in food deserts, with this percentage approaching 50 percent in western States. Investments in farmers' markets are a low-cost solution to the crisis of food deserts and provide new options for Americans who currently have limited access to healthy food. 
   In 2006, USDA received over $15 million in grant applications from farmers' markets across the country under the Farmer Marketing Assistance Program and with only $1 million in available funds, it was only able to meet a fraction of the need. That represents a tremendous missed opportunity to improve the health of Americans. Today's raising of funding of the Farmer Marketing Assistance Program to $35 million over 5 years will help us get closer to meeting the need we know is out there. I urge my colleagues to pass the 2007 Farm Bill, which includes the Kagen Amendment, and to retain this important measure in Conference.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of my constituents in Illinois to say, as strongly as possible for myself and for them, that we reject President Bush's decision to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. 
   Tragically, the President and his administration are dealing with an Iraq that exists only in their imagination. Bob Herbert said it well in Monday's New York Times: ``We need to stop pretending that there is something sane about continued U.S. involvement in this ruinous war. We keep sending troops into the combat zone, and they keep sinking ever deeper into the ancient Middle East sand. To keep sending young people off to die in a war that everybody knows is pointless is criminal.'' 
   Each time that the Bush administration has proclaimed that we must stay the course because the war has just reached a turning point, that turn has led to a dead end. 
   May 2003, President Bush declared ``Mission Accomplished.'' By the end of 2003, 486 of our troops were dead and 2,408 were wounded. And yet we stayed the course in Iraq. 
   In June 2004, President Bush said, ``We're handing over authority to a sovereign Iraqi Government ..... a turning point will come in less than 2 weeks.'' 
   By the end of 2004, 1,334 of our troops were killed and 10,408 were wounded. And yet we stayed the course in Iraq. 
   In June 2005, Vice President Cheney said, ``I think they are in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.'' And in December 2005, President Bush said `` ..... the year 2005 will be recorded as a turning point in the history of Iraq, the history of the Middle East, and the history of freedom.'' 
   By the end of 2005, 2,180 of our troops were killed and 16,354 were wounded. And yet we stayed the course in Iraq. 
   In May 2006, President Bush called the formation of a new Iraqi Government ``a turning point.'' By the end of 2006, 3,001 of our troops were killed and 22,736 were wounded. And yet we stayed the course in Iraq. 
   And just last month, Vice President Cheney proclaimed, ``Well, I think if you look at what's transpired in Iraq ..... we have, in fact, made enormous progress.'' And President Bush told us that his new strategy to escalate the war in Iraq ``will change America's course in Iraq and help us succeed in the fight against terror.'' 
   Since those remarks made just days ago, more than 120 troops are dead, and yet once again we are being asked to stay the course in Iraq. 
   My colleagues across the aisle want to characterize this troop increase, the fourth escalation, as a new direction. But the American people know better. They recognize ``stay the course'' when they see it, and they are saying no. And the administration continues the charade that if you don't support this war and this escalation, then you don't support the troops. 
   Shame on them. It is they who have failed to serve the troops who have served us so well. From day one our troops were sent into the war theater without the proper equipment to maximize their safety. Families have bake sales to buy their loved ones better vests and helmets. Just last month the Pentagon's Inspector General found that the Defense Department hasn't been able to properly equip the troops it already has with enough guns and ammunition to ``effectively complete their missions.'' That is a quote. Soldiers are short body armor, armored vehicles, and communication equipment. Imagine this war is costing $12 million every hour, 24/7 for 4 years, nearly half a trillion dollars, and our soldiers don't have enough body armor, ammunition, communications equipment?     
   If our troops aren't the priority, who is? Halliburton, Blackwater, other corporate chums of the President? Don't lecture us about caring for the troops. 
   The Executive Director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America recently said of our returning soldiers and marines, ``And when they come home, there aren't nearly enough transitional care services, job placement, transitional housing. It is just not there.'' Twelve million dollars an hour to wage this war, and our veterans are returning home without the proper care they need? 
   Our support for the troops compels us to oppose this war and this escalation. Of the terrible options the President has left us after 4 years, the absolute worst is to continue to send our young men and women in uniform to die in the meat grinder that is Iraq and to put them in the cross-hairs of a civil war. 
   Speaker Pelosi has said that our goal is to end this war. We can begin right here, right now, by passing this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. (SUPPORT THE STOP OUTSOURCING SECURITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the State Department decided to renew Blackwater's $1.2 billion contract for another year. It has been over 6 months since Blackwater contractors killed 17 innocent Iraqi civilians, 16 months since the Christmas Eve murder in the Green Zone, and 35 months since a Blackwater helicopter dropped CS gas on a traffic jam in Baghdad. Yet there have been no arrests, no charges, no trials, no convictions. Nothing. 
   The Department of Justice, the FBI and State Department have remained completely silent about these investigations. Meanwhile, those contractors are still working side-by-side with our troops in Iraq. 
   But what is even more appalling is that our government has ignored those abuses and renewed Blackwater's contract. If you owned a company, would you rehire someone who has killed dozens of innocent people? The State Department's decision not only puts the lives of innocent Iraqi civilians at risk, but it threatens the safety of our troops and jeopardizes our mission in Iraq. 
   I urge my colleagues to sign on to my bill, H.R. 4102, the SOS, or Stop Outsourcing Security Act, and phase out the use of military security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment that the provision I drafted, that would prohibit private security contractors from performing inherently governmental functions in combat areas, was stripped from this bill. The House unanimously adopted this provision, and the Senate bill contained a nearly identical provision. 
   I am extremely disappointed that the Bush administration threatened to veto this bill over this commonsense provision, forcing the Armed Services Committee to only include a sense of Congress on the use of private military contractors in this legislation. 
   The horrible incidents like that involving Blackwater Worldwide in which 17 Iraqi civilians were killed, for which no one has yet been held accountable, have damaged our already tattered image in the eyes of the Iraqi people. Private contractors are being tasked with extremely sensitive jobs like gathering intelligence and providing armed security, and they severely damage the credibility of our military with their sometimes violent and almost always unaccountable behavior. 
   Inherently government functions should be performed by people in the U.S. military or who are U.S. Government personnel, people who proudly wear the badge of the U.S. and pledge their allegiance to it.
