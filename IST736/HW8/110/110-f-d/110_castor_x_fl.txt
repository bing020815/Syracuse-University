<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1174 provides for consideration of H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule makes in order seven amendments listed in the Rules Committee report, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 and this rule. This New Direction Congress, led by Democrats, understands the impact of this unfortunate Bush economy on neighborhoods throughout America. In order for our country to recover from this economic downturn, it is critical that we stabilize housing for our neighbors and rebuild communities with more affordable housing. 
   In fact, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urged Congress to take  action earlier this week. He stated in part, summarized in this news report, ``The reasons behind surging late payments and foreclosures can vary, and that needs to be taken into account when developing solutions. For instance, in parts of New England, States in the Great Lakes, including Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, show increased mortgage delinquencies and notable increases in unemployment rates. California, Florida, and parts of Colorado, on the other hand, saw delinquencies rise during a period when unemployment generally decreased but the value of homes declined.'' 
   He said, ``A widespread decline in home prices, by contrast, is a relatively novel phenomenon, and lenders and servicers will have to develop new and flexible strategies to deal with this issue. Rising foreclosures add to the glut of unsold homes, and that put more downward pressure on prices, aggravating the housing slump. More rapid declines in house prices could have an adverse impact on the broader economy.'' 
   See, this affects us all, and it affects the stability of the financial system overall. So it is vitally important that we bring this package today, this first bill, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and more to come because of the record number of foreclosures facing our neighbors back home. 
   Under President Bush's economic policies, the number of families entering into foreclosure has increased from over 700,000 to 1.5 million last year, but today, we're going to bring new hope to our communities through revitalized neighborhoods and targeted affordable housing to families that need it most. 
   The Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 provides our local communities with the tools they need to purchase and rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed homes. Now we all know a vacant, deteriorated, foreclosed home in our neighborhood has a devastating impact. We've all seen them. We've driven by them. They're overgrown. They are not paying the taxes like everyone else in the neighborhood is paying. They're causing a drain on services and local governments. 
   Our initiatives today will help these nonprofit agencies and our local governments purchase those properties, turn them around, rehabilitate them and make them available to families that need them most, and in order to see that families with the greatest needs receive housing first, these new loans and affordable homes will be targeted especially to middle class families and those hardworking families back in our communities. 
   I know this will help families in my home State of Florida which has been among the Nation's hardest hit States, particularly in my community in the Tampa Bay area. In fact, it was not long ago that one of my neighbors called to tell me that he recently lost his home to foreclosure, and he was dealing with the repercussions from that loss, trying to find another affordable place to live for him and his family. 
   He was pleased to know, however, that this Congress had already acted on a mortgage forgiveness debt relief act signed into law last year, and because of that act, he will not suffer a double whammy and get hit with an unaffordable tax bill to accompany the loss of his home. 
   This legislation will help families from my community and communities across this Nation to rebuild and create more affordable housing. I am proud that this Congress has been so proactive and taken so many steps to combat the housing crisis. Millions of Americans will be helped because of the proactive leadership of Chairman BARNEY FRANK on the Financial Services Committee and Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS. 
   I am pleased to witness firsthand that this new Democratic Congress has made the lives of folks in my neighborhood and my community a whole lot better. Today, we will continue to move forward by passing the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and follow on that with the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. These efforts reflect the continued work of this New Direction Congress and offer the most comprehensive response yet to the American mortgage crisis. We are providing much-needed help to hardworking families in this unfortunate Bush economy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, we're going to do everything we can in our power to help American families across this Nation that, yes, are facing foreclosure. In this package we bring today we will help the folks who are facing those adjustable rates and keep them out of foreclosure. But I don't think we should turn a blind eye to the significant increase in foreclosures, the rate of foreclosures that has happened since 2003 under the Bush Administration. In 2003, 734,000 foreclosures; 2004, 835,000 foreclosures. More in 2005 and 2006. 2007, a record-breaking 1.5 million foreclosed homes in America. This Neighborhood Stabilization Act will address those vacant foreclosed homes in our neighborhoods. 
   I am going to call upon my colleague from the Rules Committee, Ms. Matsui from California, to further address the  issue. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, just for purposes of clarifying the record, I think it is important to note that a number of amendments were considered in the full committee, the Committee on Financial Services. And indeed, in the Rules Committee, we considered a number of amendments, and have accepted consideration of seven amendments in this bill that will be voted on later on. Three are Republican amendments. 
   Now I know the other side has focused a lot on delaying tactics and procedural maneuvers today, and they would love to open this up and have hundreds of amendments considered. A number of amendments filed with the Rules Committee were duplicative. We have tailored this structured rule in a fair manner. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I salute the leadership of Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters during this housing crisis and our swift action through this comprehensive housing package that has been encouraged by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and under Democratic leadership. This demonstrates that we are committed to ensuring that families across America can obtain and keep the American dream of homeownership in a safe and secure neighborhood.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee, and I rise in support of the Energy Independence and Security Act and this rule. 
   Today, we break the stranglehold that Big Oil and the special interests have had over Washington, D.C. and over our country's energy policy. 
   We're going to hear many maneuvers today and protestations, delay, resistance, points of order because this is a fundamental shift in the Nation's energy policy. 
   The contrast between the policies of the past and our forward-looking bill could not be more clear. Remember just 7 years ago when the administration's Energy Task Force met behind closed doors? It consisted of oil executives, and the administration fought to keep everything secret. Renewable sources of energy were not a priority, the Earth's climate change was not a priority, and the recommendations involved more drilling, more mining, more of the same, which led to record gas prices for our families, and record profits for oil companies, and disastrous national security consequences. 
   In contrast, our ground-breaking effort today sets our country on a path towards energy independence, particularly from the Middle East and the most volatile parts of this world. 
   Better gas mileage for automobiles is the cornerstone of our bill. That alone will save families from $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump, and that is great news for our neighbors back home. 
   What has been missing is the political leadership and the political will to make this happen in America. So today we will cast aside the politics of the past and for the first time in decades set the right priorities for America. This bill repeals the subsidies to the big oil companies and instead invests in renewable energy and biofuels technologies. 
   And to the folks back home in Florida, whom I have the privilege to represent, we're going to demonstrate here today that there is no need to put our tourism economy and beautiful beaches at risk to more oil drilling offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead, we're going to rely on American ingenuity and resourcefulness. 
   The status quo in Washington is not acceptable anymore, and we will chart a fundamental new direction on energy policy.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Sutton from Ohio, who has been fighting her whole career for the hardworking families in Ohio and now in the Congress is fighting for American workers throughout our country. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. This legislation serves as tangible evidence of the new direction being charted by this new Congress under Speaker  Nancy Pelosi. 
   A few weeks ago, this new Congress voted to raise the minimum wage. Well, like the minimum wage, the Employee Free Choice Act demonstrates our values and our commitment to stand beside hardworking men and women against powerful interests. This bill will restore the balance in the workplace and restore the National Labor Relations Act to its original purpose. 
   It is unfortunate that in the blinding zeal for profits, inordinate profits, for a few, there are unscrupulous employers that stall for time after they learn that employees want to band together to advocate for a better workplace.     
   Let me give you some real life examples from my part of Florida. One very large Central Florida employer used delays and its insistence on a secretive election to put together a highly structured unlawful campaign of coercion and intimidation. Hundreds of supervisors were trained to conduct scripted meetings with small groups of employees and then the employees were forced to attend meetings replete with promises and threats. Day after day, week after week, the company ground down these folks in this illegal psychological war on employees. This must end. 
   In another example, one central Florida company used the time waiting for the election to film employees in the workplace and then produce a film that wove in their pictures, their smiling faces, into a virulent anti-union film. In this illegal activity, the employees were forced to watch the film, which was slanted to give the false impression that those employees who had supported the UAW had switched sides. These are real-life examples, but it should not be this way. 
   The people of America know what has been going on. For too long, powerful special interests have held sway in the halls of Congress. Well, this new Congress in its first 100 days has stood up to these powerful special interests, whether it is raising the minimum wage, standing up to the big drug companies, standing up to the big oil companies. 
   There is a new day in America, and I am proud to stand today with my hard-working neighbors against powerful interests that would like to keep the act of joining a union more of a risk, rather than a right. I am proud to stand today with our Speaker and this new Congress to chart a new direction for our country.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, an important part of the honest leadership, open government rules package is the new commitment to more stringent fiscal responsibility under Democratic leadership and Speaker  Nancy Pelosi. 
   Under the current administration and past Congresses, the Nation's debt has been climbing out of sight. Currently we are faced with a nearly $3 trillion national budget deficit. The rising interest rates and a projected individual share of the national debt of more than $28,000 per person is outrageous. 
   As a mother with two young daughters, I am concerned, like so many other parents today. You see, the personal cost of spiraling debt to the American public is overwhelming. Families are working to provide the best opportunities for their children, while juggling mortgages, credit card debt and student loans, as well as rising health care costs and housing costs. 
   How can our neighbors back home decrease their debt loads until the Federal Government begins to do its part? That is why the restoration of pay-as-you-go budgeting is the right step in a new direction. Pay-as-you-go is not entirely new, however. 
   Let me close by saying that these rules changes are essential to assure our neighbors that Congress is working earnestly to do our part to relieve the financial crunch on working families, while providing a transparent framework in which to do it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my good friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings) who is a strong supporter of the space program. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6063, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act of 2008. 
   NASA is celebrating its 50-year anniversary this year, and I salute and congratulate everyone at NASA for their contributions to American life and science. Space exploration and research comprised the foundation of technological advances in America that have greatly improved all of our lives. 
   For example, in early NASA missions, large-scale integrated circuits were created that today are the basis for all modern computers, and how would we live without computers today? NASA also helps the United States maintain its competitive edge in the global marketplace. More engineers now come from outside the United States that are produced by our colleges and universities. 
   America can do better. NASA is one of the keys to doing so. NASA scientists and researchers keep America focused on innovation and better-paying jobs. In addition, fewer and fewer children are interested in entering science fields, even though our world today is dominated by science and technology. We must encourage young people and students to stay interested in science and enter scientific fields of study. The fantastic NASA missions and research also plays a vital role here. 
   There are currently seven astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery preparing to return to earth after a highly successful mission. I had the privilege of watching the successful launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery a week and a half ago at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. I was thrilled to share that day with our colleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, as her husband, Mark Kelly, is the commander of the Space Shuttle Discovery. 
   Congratulations to the Discovery crew, the mission team on the ground as well, as they have successfully delivered the Japanese Kibo scientific lab to the International Space Station and have now completed their mission. The personnel at the Kennedy Space Center and their partners throughout Florida have an unmatched dedication to our country's space program. 
   They are a highly trained workforce with a record of achievement and tradition that cannot be matched. That's why it troubles me that President Bush has threatened a veto of this important NASA bill. 
   I urge President Bush to reflect on these facts before he picks up his veto pen, which he threatened to do yesterday in a letter to us. Before President Bush vetoes this outstanding NASA reauthorization bill, I would urge the White House to consider the economic impact of such a bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 807, honoring the life of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, champion of the Florida Everglades, and founder of Florida's environmental movement. Marjory Stoneman Douglas's life was dedicated to the idea that my State of Florida, and indeed the United States has a great treasure in the Everglades, unlike any other in the world. When others were looking at the land of the Everglades with the hope of draining away the water, and building on the land, Marjory Stoneman Douglas allowed all of us to see Florida the way she saw it, in its utterly unique natural majesty. When she spoke, it was with the voice of the Everglades, and the natural places of Florida. 
   Marjory Stoneman Douglas was a tireless advocate since her youth, writing as a voice for the voiceless and downtrodden, and fighting for equality of people of all races, genders, and for the conservation of the natural places. But it was not until she was almost 60 years old, that she wrote ``Everglades: River of Grass.'' That book, in the simplicity, beauty and depth of its prose, opened the eyes of America to the significance of the Everglades, and the great danger of allowing that treasure to be squandered. Marjory Stoneman Douglas wrote ``Everglades: River of Grass in 1947.'' By December of that year, the Everglades had been dedicated as a part of the National Parks System. 
   Marjory Stoneman Douglas devoted her life to preserving the Everglades she had first helped to bring into American consciousness. She fought to prevent shortsighted development that would have permanently damaged the Everglades, and to restore the park to its former majesty. In her autobiography, she wrote that ``Since 1972, I've been going around making speeches on the Everglades. No matter how poor my eyes are I can still talk. I'll talk about the Everglades at the drop of a hat. Whoever wants me to talk, I'll come over and tell them about the necessity of preserving the Everglades.'' 
   She began ``Everglades: River of Grass'' by writing, ``there are no other Everglades in the world. They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth.'' In the same way, there was only one Marjory Stoneman Douglas. She was a unique individual, in the conservation movement, and we in Florida, and in the United States, owe her a great debt. We are proud to honor her life and her work today.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, ``Here are no lofty peaks seeking the sky, no mighty glaciers or rushing streams wearing away the uplifted land. Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty, serving not as the source of water, but as the receiver of it. To its natural abundance we owe the spectacular plant and animal life that distinguishes this place from all others in our country.'' 
   These were the words of Harry Truman, 60 years ago at the dedication of the Everglades National Park. And it is in the same spirit that I support H. Res. 845, recognizing the 60th anniversary of Everglades National Park. The Everglades are a completely unique treasure for Floridians, and all Americans. So it is fitting that they should also be unique in the national park system. The Everglades were the first unit of the park system to be designated not for their scenic beauty alone, but for the extraordinary diversity of their wildlife. 
   One of the largest bodies of fresh water in the United States, Lake Okeechobee, sits at the top of the Everglades. During the wet season, Okeechobee slowly pours water over its southern edge, and it flows out in a slow flood that slides south and spreads out over hundreds of square miles. The water flows south, but very slowly, sometimes as little as a hundred feet in a day. And it is remarkably shallow, as little as a foot in depth, which allows the incredible diversity of plant and animal life, unrivaled in the Nation. 
   In 1947, when Marjory Stoneman Douglas published ``Everglades: River of Grass'' and Harry Truman dedicated the Everglades as part of the parks system, it was with the intention of preserving the Everglades for future generations. Douglas continued to fight for the Everglades for the rest of her life, and she led an ever growing chorus of voices, advocating for our environment. The Everglades became a touchstone for an entire movement of Floridians and other Americans who continue to fight to save our natural places, not only for future generations, but also for their own sake. 
   Unfortunately, the Everglades still faces threats of the attrition of development, and the redirection of its waters. In the Water Resources Development Plan of 2000, Congress included a comprehensive restoration plan to bring the Everglades back to its natural state. The Everglades remain one of the Nation's greatest natural treasures, and I am proud to stand in recognition today of their 60th anniversary as part of the park system.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my colleague from New Jersey, who has been such a leader for the American people for access to better health care. He is absolutely right, that the President's actions don't match his words. I have also been combing through the Presidential budget proposal. One of my hometown newspapers said that the Presidential budget should begin with these words: ``Once upon a time,'' as in a fairy tale. I am a mom with two young daughters at home. We do a lot of reading at night and try to get the homework done. We will do reading of fairy tales. This, what the White House has sent over, is a political fairy tale. Unfortunately, it is going to hurt a lot of folks. It is going to hurt a lot of our constituents back home. I thought we could explain that a little bit. 
   Oftentimes we talk in such technical terms in government. When we talk of Medicaid and people say Medicaid, sometimes they get Medicaid and Medicare mixed up. 
   Medicaid, these are pregnant women, infants, children in families earning about $25,000 a year, foster kids, medically needy adults, a lot of our senior citizens in nursing homes. So when you hear there are Medicaid cuts, I would like us to really put a face on that and say they are going after the most vulnerable in this country, infants, poor kids, foster kids and seniors in nursing homes. 
   Also the budget sent over from the White House will hurt our seniors. The White House proposes to cut Medicare. Now, I am from Florida, and a lot of folks retire down to Florida. They have worked hard all their lives, and this is really one of the only benefits that we can give them, in addition to Social Security. So what the White House budget is proposing to do is ask them to pay even more. They are asking our hardworking doctors to take a cut as well. 
   What that does in my community in Tampa Bay is it discourages the best doctors from participating in Medicare. You see, I want my seniors to have the best medical care. I want them to see the best doctors, and I want those good doctors to stay in the Medicare system. 
   This would also hurt our children, our kids back home. My colleague from New Jersey knows this very well, that under the State Children's Health Insurance Program, we have a lot of needs. The States, our local communities, the Feds, we have been doing a pretty good job. But, do you know what? We can do a whole lot better. We must do a lot better. 
   So it was very disappointing to receive this budget from the White House that says: Do you know what? Even though we are making such progress, and we have such tremendous needs in this country for children to be able to go in and see a doctor, get their immunizations, get some advice on how to take care of themselves, they say we are not going to do that. 
   Their priorities are out of whack. Instead, I think it is a blatant political statement that we are going to continue these tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, and we are going to sock it to the most vulnerable, our seniors and our kids.

   Ms. CASTOR. We talked earlier about how the White House budget proposal we received this week is a fairy tale, but its impact on our veterans really is a nightmare. The State of Florida where I am from, we have the second highest number of veterans in the country, and in my district, I have the busiest VA center in the country, the James Haley Center, which saw over 1.5 million vets last year. That is more than the population of the State of Kansas we saw at the Haley Center in Tampa. 
   The Haley Center is specialized for current Iraq war vets injured, coming back, that are suffering the IED blasts, spinal cord injuries, brain injuries. And in Florida, out of all the VA medical centers, Haley, the busiest, we have  gone now over the past 10 years from 2 million visits to over 5 million visits. And how can we say this is a reflection of values? How can we say we are going to step back from that responsibility? How can the White House send us a budget that steps back, at a time where they are escalating the war in Iraq, they are going to deescalate the commitment to our veterans? I don't think so. 
   In this Democratic Congress, we are going to take a new direction. There is new leadership in Washington, DC. And I am proud to be joined by some of the new Members, my colleagues, tonight, and also join with the efforts of leaders like my colleague from New Jersey. And I yield back.

   Ms. CASTOR. You all are absolutely right. It is very difficult to understand why the White House wants to sock it to our safety net hospitals. Have you all been to the emergency room lately, tried to get in? The long lines? People are ending up in our emergency rooms for their primary care because they have the flu. They are clogging the emergency rooms. 
   I was a county commissioner before I was elected to Congress, and the brave men and women in fire rescue said they would transport to the emergency room. It would be so busy and so full, they would have to stay with the emergency patient in the EMS truck for hours because the emergency room was clogged. 
   We have a crisis in this country, and it is inexplicable that the Bush administration would say by administrative rule and through this budget that has been sent to the Congress this week that we are going to cut money to those hospitals that provide the charity care in our country.     
   In my district, in the Tampa Bay area, the impact on Tampa General Hospital, which is a level one trauma center, $64 million. The great All Children's Hospital across the bay in Saint Petersburg, $31 million; the great St. Joseph's Hospital, another $20 million. 
   I would like to go back to SCHIP and also talk about the real-world, children's health insurance, because a few months ago, I ran into a friend of mine from high school, haven't seen her since I graduated 20-something years ago, and I saw her at a children's health insurance discussion. 
   She told me her story. Her name is Nan Dorton, and she lives in Tampa. She is married and has three kids. Her husband went through a tough time, and he lost his job, so they lost their health insurance. They didn't know what to do. It was very, very tough times. They didn't know about children's health insurance in Florida called KidCare or Healthy Kids, because the State has cut back under Governor Jeb Bush and the Republican legislature and they don't do any more outreach, so it is hard to find out about it. 
   Fortunately, he got a job. They were provided with health insurance through the employer. But you know how much it costs for that family to have the kids covered, $700 a month. She said it was hard to choose whether to put food on the table or take the kids to the doctor and sign them up for health insurance. She said, you live in constant fear of your child having to go to the hospital. 
   But then she found out about children's health insurance and KidCare, and signed them up. She said it revolutionized their lives because under these  health services, they pay a $20-per-month copayment for all three kids, and they don't have any copays for hospital visits or prescriptions. You know how much money that is saving us because they are not showing up in the emergency room, which is passed on to all of us in our health insurance? That is going to save us because that family is healthier today, and we are going to save that money later on down the road.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, access to the highest quality health care for our seniors under Medicare is one of the most important issues facing this Congress. Unfortunately, the Bush White House has sought to undermine the great Medicare safety net by privatizing a great deal of health care under the Medicare system, turning it over to HMOs. 
   Just last week the former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2001 to 2003 spoke at a conference in Tampa and a reporter caught him on record saying that this privatization effort ``was done to prime the pump and to get people to go back to HMOs. But it's a much bigger subsidy than we intended.'' 
   You see, these private plans receive about 11 percent more per beneficiary than the government spends in original Medicare. And this director said that he had meant for the subsidy to be about half that. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of work to do to stand up for our seniors and ensure the Medicare safety net works for everyone.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Chairman, this amendment ensures that hardworking families who are feeling the strain of skyrocketing health care costs can still afford to send their children to college. The amendment applies to the Federal parent PLUS loans. PLUS loans are the non-need-based, federally guaranteed, low-interest loans available to parents for their children's undergraduate tuition, room and board and other expenses. 
   Our neighbors are really getting squeezed these days. They are socked with the rising cost of housing and health care. And many families are very concerned that a college education may be out of reach for their children due to these rising costs. 
   This amendment allows parents to continue to access low-interest PLUS loans even if they have fallen behind on medical bills only up to 180 days. This extenuating circumstance exemption is identical to the one already provided in the bill for mortgage payment delinquencies. 
   Housing and health care are the primary sources of financial hardship for families. Late mortgage payments and uncollected copayments for doctors' visits are among the primary reasons for bad debt. But these short-term and temporary extenuating circumstances should not bar parents from assisting their children with attending college. 
   By adding this amendment to section 4, special rules for PLUS loans, we ensure that hardworking families feeling the strain in this economy of skyrocketing health care costs can still afford to send their children to college. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, all of the members on the Education and Labor Committee and the professional staff for their work.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 720, WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 229 provides for the consideration of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the substitute reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, modified by the manager's amendment in the Rules Committee report, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended. 
   The rule makes in order only those further amendments printed in part B of the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution. The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against the amendments, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI, are waived. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   And I am pleased to point out, Madam Speaker, that under this structured rule, the six amendments made in order are split equally, three Republican and three Democratic. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 720 reauthorizes an important part of the landmark Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act protects our neighborhoods and water bodies from water pollution. Clean water is vital to the health of our citizens and to our country. 
   The bill before us today reauthorizes the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund by providing $14 billion over the next 5 years to local agencies to fight water pollution. 
   We have come a long way in this country. We have the technology and the engineering experience to prevent water pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates a huge shortfall in funds available for wastewater improvements across the country. This shortfall is significant because, without considerable improvements to the wastewater treatment infrastructure, much of the progress made in cleaning up the Nation's rivers, creeks and streams and bays since the passage of the Clean Water Act is at risk. 
   Clean water is a top priority for the families in my district and throughout the Nation. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership over the past few Congresses has failed to support this part of the Clean Water Act. Although legislation was introduced in the Congress then, it never made it to the House floor. 
   President Bush and the White House also proposed slashing this Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund in his latest budget proposal. But, nevertheless, we are hopeful today that a bipartisan vote in support of this measure will send a signal to the White House that clean and healthy water is absolutely vital to our communities. In fact, in my hometown of Tampa, Florida, the Clean Water Act Loan Funds for wastewater improvements have vastly improved the water quality of Tampa Bay. The expansion in wastewater treatment significantly improved the quality of water running into beautiful Tampa Bay. 
   In past years, Tampa received over $54 million for wastewater treatment plant expansion and thereby improved water quality. It has also played a role in significantly improving the water in our rivers, bays, creeks and streams as we are able to control the pollutants that run off into these vital water bodies. 
   This is the same story across the country for the improved health of our communities, on the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and other water bodies throughout our country. Check with your local governments and your neighbors who live around and who are mindful of the quality of the water in our lakes, rivers and bays in your hometown. 
   Appearing before our Rules Committee, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman JIM OBERSTAR said it best: ``This is not just a good bill. It is a necessary one. The good health of our communities depends upon it.'' 
   And as a former county commissioner, I can tell you that the vast majority of costs in cleaning our water falls upon our local communities. And if we don't act now, we will be shifting a greater cost to future generations. 
   So I urge the Congress, Madam Speaker, to enact this rule and this important legislation to keep our communities, rivers, lakes and bays clean and, most importantly, to improve the health of our children, seniors, and all citizens. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank my colleague and I note that my colleague, unable to criticize the heart of this legislation, which is reauthorization of an important part of the Clean Water Act, instead reverts to attacking a portion of this legislation that is vital to workers across America, the Davis-Bacon provisions. 
   The Davis-Bacon Act prevents lower-cost out-of-State contractors from having an unfair ability to compete for local publicly funded construction, which protects local interests and construction workers. 
   Unfortunately, it has become all too familiar from the other side of the aisle to attack workers across America. They blocked the minimum wage until this new Congress was elected. We have a White House that has favored outsourcing of jobs over time. 
   But now, through this legislation, we are able to reaffirm again that it is our policy, in fact, it is Congress's longstanding continuing tradition of applying prevailing wage requirements to federally funded construction projects. Studies have shown that by attracting more experienced, better-trained workers, that wage requirements lead to higher productivity and they reduce overall costs, which offset any higher wages.     
   The Davis-Bacon Act protects communities by ensuring that wage determination also for individual counties is based solely on the local workforce costs. Oftentimes, this means that projects come in under budget and on time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we don't delay any longer and that we take action on this rule and this legislation that reauthorizes an important part of the Clean Water Act. 
   I understand where some of the debate is going to occur today, and I understand that a sizable number of Members on the other side of the aisle oppose the Davis-Bacon requirements for fair wages across the country. But the Rules Committee has made in order an amendment on Davis-Bacon, and Members in this body will have an opportunity to debate and vote on that issue. It is important, however, as we enter that debate, that we recognize that Davis-Bacon ensures a higher-quality work product and ensures that the work is done right the first time as higher-paid workers are the best trained and most experienced. 
   I urge Members to defeat that amendment and continue in the new direction that is being charted by this new Democratic Congress where we stand up for the hard-working men and women across this great country. 
   It is too important to delay any longer this reauthorization of the Clean Water Act. It is imperative that Congress now pass the Water Quality Financing Act, H.R. 720, which will provide critically needed funds for clean water infrastructure. It will protect the public health, the environment and our quality of life. It will restore the viability of the Federal, State and local partnership to meet the goals of the Clean Water Act. And ultimately, if we take action today, we will protect and improve the health of our citizens across America. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word in opposition to the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Peterson amendment and in defense of Florida's economy and natural environment. New, off-shore oil and gas drilling so close to the beautiful Florida coastline and all of our Nation's waters must be voted down today, as it threatens our economy, our natural environment, and our strategy for a new energy policy. 
   Our economy, in Florida, and many of you know, Mr. Chairman, because so many take the time out of their vacation plans to come down to the State of Florida, enjoy their time away on our beautiful beaches. Our tourism economy in Florida is a multibillion dollar industry. It goes hand in hand with our multibillion dollar fishing industry. And it is absolutely worth protecting here today. 
   Our beaches, our coastal environment, our marine resources, in addition to our fragile ecosystems, all of this will be put at risk by these amendments here today if they are successful.     
   I am fortunate in my district to have a wonderful Department of Oceanography located at the University of South Florida. Here is what those researchers have warned: 
   It would only take 24 hours after a petroleum spill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico for oil to ``sully Florida's Panhandle beaches if the spill was swept up by the gulf's powerful Loop Current. This spill could travel around the Florida Keys and contaminate estuaries and beaches from the Everglades to Cape Canaveral.'' That is from the University of South Florida Department of Oceanography. 
   In addition to that, one only has to look back a couple of years to know that it is completely unwise to put these types of facilities in hurricane alley. The gulf coast and the east coast, these are the two most coveted offshore areas by the oil and gas industry. That is where the threat of hurricanes is the greatest. It could wreak havoc on what they're trying to do there. 
   In 2005, in that hurricane season, that was the first year in reported history that we had three category five storms: Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In 2005 Hurricanes Rita and Katrina caused massive spills of oil and other pollutants that seriously affected production, refinery capacity, and the price of oil in the United States. The storms caused 124 oil spills into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. During Hurricane Katrina alone, 233,000 gallons of oil were spilled. There were 508,000 gallons of oil spilled during Hurricane Rita. And the U.S. Minerals Management Service reports that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed 115 petroleum production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. The storms also damaged 457 pipelines, connecting production facilities in the gulf, and bringing oil and natural gas to shore. A full year after Katrina, BP admitted that a damaged oil well valve in the Gulf of Mexico was still leaking oil. The knee-jerk reaction to throw up more rigs offshore, especially in hurricane-prone waters like Florida's gulf coast and the eastern seaboard is precarious at best and not smart energy policy. 
   As much as the oil and gas lobby would like us to believe that drilling near our beaches would be a panacea, the experts say that only a couple of weeks of oil and gas are available. 
   Mr. Chairman, we can be smarter. We can be more strategic. Where is the commitment to conservation in this country? 
   Just a minute ago, the Senate sent over its new energy bill. Well, it is time for this House to get to work on new alternative energies and not continue to fuel our addiction to oil and gas. 
   Let's oppose these amendments.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Hastings), who has been an outspoken advocate for environmental justice for this great country and a strong supporter of Everglades restoration. So I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, our natural environment and clean neighborhoods are vital to the health of the folks that we represent back home. This bill, and the rule, contains much to recommend it to the American people. But I rise in support today because my community, the Tampa Bay area, will benefit greatly due to the new investments being made under the leadership of this new Democratic Congress. 
   See, our communities have suffered over past years while environmental agencies were infiltrated by industry lobbyists. That was a strategy of this White House, unfortunately. And some in past Congresses whittled away at environmental protections.     
   Well, we're going to begin to turn that around today and repair America's natural environment and the public health so we can breathe easier. 
   First, we will make new investments in clean air and clean and safe drinking water. We know that the rate of asthma in children is rising in America, and this bill will help our communities get back on track with enforcement of the Clean Air Act. 
   On clean water, the residents of the cities of Tampa and St. Petersburg have benefited greatly over the years due to the Clean Water Act and the State Water Revolving Loan Program because my communities have been able to repair sewers, and in my hometown, clean up Tampa Bay and make it safer for swimming, boating, and fishing. But we have more work to do. The National Estuary Program portion of this bill will help, as the bill provides greater assistance to local communities to improve water quality in our national estuaries like Tampa Bay. 
   I also hope the committee will look favorably upon an amendment relating to the red tide that is affecting the physical environment of our coastal communities and causing respiratory ailments at a time when folks are trying to enjoy their vacation at the beach. 
   Urban communities like mine also need assistance in cleaning up toxic waste sites and Superfund sites. As a former county commissioner back home, I understand the value of cleaning up old brownfield sites so they do not remain as blights on the community. Oftentimes these polluted industrial sites are located in communities of modest means. So I salute the committee and Chairman Dicks for his commitment to environmental justice to ensure that environmental decisions do not adversely affect minority populations. 
   This bill also charts a new direction on global warming as well by increasing climate change scientific research, including attention to coastal communities to help us determine how we can best adapt to a warming planet. 
   This act and rule also provides long overdue funding for our national parks, including the beautiful Florida Everglades. Thanks to Chairman Dicks and the committee for stepping up our efforts to ensure that these valuable environmental resources are protected. 
   One final issue: this bill maintains the long-standing moratoria on oil and gas drilling off our beautiful gulf coast beaches. Now, I expect that the oil and gas lobby will take a run at this protection today, and I urge my colleagues to hold firm. 
   In Florida and in other coastal States, drilling threatens our environment, it threatens our health, and it threatens our economic livelihood. Instead of risking our critical coastline for short-term gain, the new Democratic majority is pursuing a long-term energy strategy by investing in energy conservation and alternative fuels. 
   Granting oil and gas leases and access to our coastline is not the solution to our energy crisis. The current leases that oil and gas companies exploit far off the coastline exist with the help of taxpayers. Allowing drilling closer to our coastline is simply a way for oil and gas companies to maximize their profits. Such actions will have no effect on either the cost of gas or on the future of our energy needs. 
   I urge my colleagues to beat back this scheme of the oil and gas lobby today, their attempt to kill a ban on coastal drilling that was enacted in response to a 1969 oil and gas bill that blackened 35 miles of California's coast. 
   Instead of drilling for limited resources, the country needs an accelerated program for alternative fuels, and Congress needs to investigate the oil companies' unseemly profits. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and the rule. I salute the leadership of Chairman Dicks, and I thank Ranking Member Tiahrt. This legislation will protect our environment and our public health and focus on renewable energy solutions that are vital to the State of Florida and the future of our great Nation.

   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of giving away billions of dollars to big oil companies which made multibillion-dollar profits last year, the new Congress intends to chart a course in a new direction by investing in alternatives for the American people. This will help America become energy independent and ultimately lower the utility cost for average Americans. 
   Big Oil has held too much sway in the halls of Congress in past years. They even targeted drilling off of Florida's beautiful coastline, putting our tourism industry at risk. The Bush administration refused to get serious about a sensible and sustainable energy policy, even after President Bush proclaimed last year that our country is addicted to foreign oil. 
   The American people understand that what we really need is a far-sighted plan for energy independence, and they did vote for change. The new Democratic Congress will plan for a more sustainable future, independent of foreign oil entanglements that interfere with our foreign policy. The new Democratic Congress will encourage conservation and development of alternative fuels which in turn will lessen our dependence on polluting fossil fuels. 
   In my own district, the University of South Florida has developed initiatives at its Clean Energy Research Center to develop and promote new sources of alternative energy, and we can do more.     
   So let's take the first step together today and then commit to launching a broad new energy strategy for future generations.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Rules Chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to bring this debate to the floor of the Congress. I oppose escalation of the war in Iraq that is being pushed by President Bush and Vice President Cheney. Their intention to send more young American men and women into what is largely a sectarian civil war is more of the same ``stay the course'' mentality. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am particularly concerned that the reckless Bush escalation will undermine our country's readiness and ability to address other global threats to our national security. Indeed, in recent testimony, the Marine Commandant and the Army Chief of Staff testified that America will run a strategic risk by implementing the escalation and staying on the same course in Iraq. The generals confirmed that if our personnel and equipment are tied up in Iraq, then our ability to handle future threats and contingencies is reduced. 
   For example, in my State of Florida, the National Guard does not have all of the equipment it needs to train and deploy soldiers. They are only 28 percent equipped. 
   President Bush in essence confirmed that the escalation will harm our Nation's readiness when he sent over his proposed 2008 budget last week. He requested an additional $235 billion for this war. That is on top of already $350 billion of taxpayer money. In effect, Bush's war in Iraq is swallowing the defense budget and our country's ability to prepare for any other threat to our national security. 
   The Bush plan also sacrifices health care for children and our seniors and investments in our own towns and neighborhoods, while continuing this war without end. 
   We will debate budgets and appropriations in the coming months, but after 4 years of war, over 3,100 deaths of Americans, $350 billion, and the Bush-Cheney failure to aggressively pursue a political solution, it is important that we have this debate in the House of Representatives this week. It is important for Members to go on record, and it is important to demand a new direction on behalf of the American people.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1441 provides for consideration of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order five amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, it is important that elementary and secondary schools across America continue to offer curriculum that is aligned with the needs of our children and the interests of our great country. That is why the Congress will move today to extend the National Environmental Education Act under an initiative offered by the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. JOHN SARBANES, entitled the No Child Left Inside Act. 
   This national environmental education bill was reported by the Committee on Education and Labor by a strong bipartisan vote. Under the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee chairman, GEORGE MILLER, our Nation's students have been well served by this Congress with numerous landmark reforms and investments. 
   I thought we would take the time just to name a few. This Congress has passed the College Cost Reduction Act that was signed into law last year. It provides the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill, roughly $20 billion over the next 5 years. But it does so at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Under the law, 6.8 million students who take out need-based Federal student loans each year will see the interest rates on their loans halved over the next 5 years, saving the typical borrower over $4,000 during the life of the loan once that is implemented. 
   That College Cost Reduction Act also boosts the maximum Pell Grant scholarship to $5,400 over the next 5 years. That's up from about $4,000 in 2006. 
   In a part of that bill that has not received a lot of attention, that new law provides loan forgiveness for public service members like nurses, police officers, firefighters and first responders and makes those loan repayments more manageable and gives up-front tuition to students who commit to teaching in the high-need public schools. 
   This Congress has also passed, and it has been signed into law, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans for American Families. There is nothing more important during this credit crunch than that affordable student loans and access to college remains available for our young students that would like to attend college. 
   That Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans for American Families Act provides new protections, in addition to those already in current law, to ensure that families continue to have timely, uninterrupted access to Federal college loans in the event that distress in the credit markets leads to a significant number of lenders in the federally guaranteed student loan programs to substantially reduce their lending activity. 
   The Congress has also passed, and it was signed into law just last month, the expanding college access for students and families law. It passed the House here by a vote of 380-49. The legislation addresses the rising price of college by encouraging colleges to rein in price increases, clean up corrupt practices in student loan programs and streamline the Federal financial aid application process. The bill also addresses textbook costs and increases college aid and support programs for veterans and military families. 
   Madam Speaker, this is another bill before us today that continues the new direction, Congress' commitment to higher education, and to improving elementary and secondary education for students across America. 
   Today we will focus on improvement to environmental education for America's schools, the best kind, where Washington doesn't dictate the parameters or curriculum to local schools, but gives schools the tools they need to decide themselves how to modernize curriculum. Today, it is our challenge, and the challenge of our children, to build a more sustainable energy efficient world, and sometimes you have to get outside the classroom and learn by doing and exploring your environment. 
   Many children, including my 9-year-old daughter, learn more effectively this way. I know many of you love to visit classrooms and talk with students, like I do. 
   Students today are particularly interested in energy conservation, climate change, clean air and clean water. Students, teachers and schools are clamoring for more knowledge and understanding of our natural environment. 
   Unfortunately, many schools and school districts simply do not have the resources to teach beyond the basics these days. Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, we have seen a narrowing of school curriculum with schools being forced to spend more and more learning time preparing for high-stakes testing. 
   Well, like other science courses, this grant program, under the national environmental education program, the environmental education instructs students in critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, obtaining and analyzing data, communication and learning by doing. These skills are critical for success in the 21st century, and environmental education helps students by learning how to conserve, how to conserve energy, how to ensure safe products are on the shelves, which eventually strengthens our Nation's economy and makes it a much safer world. 
   Our environmental actions here at home have an impact on the global economy and on our energy security, and energy security is national security. Having a solid understanding of natural environment and our global interdependency is critical to keeping this Nation safe. 
   The modest but important resources we will send to local schools under this National Environmental Education Act is particularly helpful now. Helping our kids to learn about the natural environment in an active learning setting will motivate students and propel them  towards success. It will pull kids away from the TV sets and the video games and the video screens and bring them outdoors. 
   The bill supports local efforts to expand and enhance environmental education and also provides teachers with important professional development opportunities. Under this legislation, our Nation's teachers will become better equipped to teach students about the environment and encourage students to be knowledgeable about environmental issues and how they affect all of us. 
   When environmental education is integrated into the classrooms, students and teachers are better able to use current, local environmental issues to increase their understanding of math, science, history and other academic subjects. 
   Environmental education is a powerful tool to help motivate students to help take care of the environment and help improve their academic achievement. 
   This bill also strengthens environmental literacy plans. According to the Campaign for Environmental Literacy, Americans still widely lack the environmental knowledge that will enable them to safeguard the public health, protect natural resources, support energy conservation efforts and engage in the movement towards a more sustainable future. 
   So this is a win-win proposition for our local schools, for teachers and for the future of our great country. This legislation will modernize environmental education for the 21st century by emphasizing environmental literacy. 
   I urge passage of the rule and this underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, over the past year and a half, this new direction Congress has been solely focused on growing and strengthening America's middle class. Despite the protestations from my friend from the other side of the aisle, it was just this  week that we passed the most comprehensive, balanced energy legislation that has been considered in the past decade. That Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act proved that there are real differences between the two sides of the aisle here because our energy bill was focused on lowering prices for consumers and protecting taxpayers. 
   Yes, it expanded domestic drilling offshore and on land, but it also added a huge expansion of renewable sources of energy. It increases our security by freeing America from the grip of foreign oil. And it finally requires Big Oil to pay what it owes the American taxpayers. 
   Is it fair that Big Oil continues to receive taxpayer subsidies at a time when they are making huge record profits? No, it doesn't, so we end the subsidies to the big oil companies. And a lot of this new emphasis on clean, green, renewable energy will have the extra added benefit of creating good-paying jobs here in America. 
   Besides energy, we have also been focused on landmark education reform. Indeed, as I highlighted at the beginning of consideration of this bill, we've passed truly landmark historic investments in education for America's students. First was the single largest increase in college aid since the GI bill, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. Under that law, 6.8 million students who take out need-based Federal loans each year will see the interest rates on their loans cut in half. 
   We increased Pell Grants by over $1,000. We have also passed and it was signed into law by President Bush the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans For American Families Act. That is so vital during this turmoil in the financial markets. It is absolutely vital that American families can still get those low-cost student loans. That new law provides new protections to ensure that families have timely, uninterrupted access to Federal college loans in the event that distress in the credit markets leads to a significant number of lenders not being liquid and being able to lend to families. 
   We also expanded college access for students and families, we cleaned up the corrupt practices going on on some campuses in student loan programs, addressed student textbook costs and increased college aid and support programs for veterans and military families. 
   And one that I didn't mention but I think we can all celebrate, the hugely bipartisan and popular new GI bill for the 21st century that will provide 4-year scholarships to the brave men and women who have served in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. We truly have been on the side of American families and the middle class. 
   This modest bill today also renews our commitment to the No Child Left Inside Act. Doesn't that really bring all of this together as we focus on energy policy and improving our public education and higher education in this country, a modest but important commitment to students at home who are interested in environmental sustainability and energy conservation. We will provide additional resources to our schools and our students so they can get outside the classroom, get away from the TV set and the video games and learn by doing, learn in an active setting, learn out in the natural environment how to conserve energy and to address global climate change. 
   Studies shows that environmental education boosts student achievement, it builds students' critical thinking and social skills, it improves student behavior, and it can enhance teaching. So we are going to help schools and States expand and enhance environmental education. We are going to focus on qualified expert teachers in the Nation's classrooms, and strengthen and develop environmental literacy plans. 
   For a long time there was another group in charge here in Washington, and it oftentimes seems like over the past decades it has been the Democrats who have had to come in and clean up the mess of past administrations. Well, I think we are proving again that we are on track to do that again. We are all in this together and we need to pass this bill. I urge a unanimous ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, who has been a leader in this Congress on health care, and, yes, you are joined by a number of new Members tonight that were elected because of our desire to work on health care solutions for the American people. 
   So like my colleague from Wisconsin and my colleague from Pennsylvania, I also listened intently last week to what President Bush had to say on health care, and, unfortunately, I did not hear anything that will help one person go to the doctor's office and get health care. Instead, what he said is, you go to your accountant's office, not your doctor's office. You go to your accountant's office and you get a tax deduction and you work that out on your tax forms. 
   Well, that does not make sense for the vast majority of people, especially in the Tampa Bay area, 20 percent without health insurance today, having to go to the emergency room for their primary care, rather than going to a doctor's office for their primary care. 
   He says take a tax deduction. The problem is that so many people are just getting by. They are right there at the poverty level. That is $9,000 for an individual, about $20,000 for a family of four. Imagine trying to live off $20,000 for a family of four. They do not pay taxes. They do not pay income taxes. They pay sales tax, but that tax deduction that President Bush wants you to get to get your health care is not going to do anything for those hardworking families. 
   The second part of his plan is equally troubling because he wants to sock it to the hospitals in this country that are providing charity care. In Tampa, Tampa General Hospital provides millions of dollars in charity care, and they are able through Federal law to send up some money, match it and bring home some dollars, especially in Hillsboro County, a county of about 1.3 million people. We have an award-winning health care program where the citizens of the county and a lot of our tourists pay a sales tax, and we devote that to a system of clinics throughout our community. We also send up that money to the Federal Government, and they say you are doing such a good job on the local level, taking care of your citizens in a network of clinics and not in the ER, that we will give you further incentives through ``disproportionate share money'' they call it. 
   What the President would do is take those incentives away from local governments like mine, like in Hillsboro County, this network of doctors and  hospitals that we have built up, and say, you know what we are going to do with that stream of money, we are going to probably turn it over to the HMOs and privatize the system. 
   This, I think, is another attempt by the Bush administration to embark on a privatization scheme which sounds awfully similar to what he proposed for Social Security. 
   My locals, my hospitals, doctors and, most importantly, the hardworking families in my district are not going to be well-served by the President's health care proposals. What do you think this will do to hospitals in your area?

   Ms. CASTOR. You are right. Add the Medicare part D privatization, all of those moneys going to HMO profits and pharmaceutical companies' profits, to Social Security privatization attempted by the Bush administration, why are hospitals' charity care next? Why the foundation of the last resort for so many families? Why do they want to take away resources from the hardworking doctors and our charity hospitals?

   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   There is good news now that we have the new Democratic Congress, and this year we are going to reauthorize that children's health insurance program. The gentleman from New Jersey has been a true leader in this effort, and I look forward to working with you in that effort. 
   But here is a real success story over the years where, under President Clinton, out of a program that grew out of the State of Florida, so I have a bit of pride in that, children of working families, and we are not talking about the low-income, impoverished, we are talking middle-class families that don't have any other way to take their son or daughter to the doctor in an affordable way. 
   Well, this year is our opportunity to look at what has worked across the country. There are programs in many States. Many States have been very aggressive, and they understand how important it is for children to be immunized, for them to make sure that a cold doesn't turn into pneumonia, because ultimately we will pay those higher costs on the back end if we don't treat them on the front end. 
   Unfortunately, in the State of Florida, we are not living up to the initiation of the program and the grant, the pride that comes from that originating in Florida. I am going to have to get one of these nice fancy charts one day. But I have got one here that shows what a success it was in Florida when we started, but because of bureaucratic barriers created under another Bush, under former Governor Bush, we have lost hundreds of thousands of children off the rolls, which doesn't mean that all children in Florida are healthier, we are still a growing State, but they have created such a costly bureaucracy for parents and for doctors and for all health care providers that we are not able to serve kids like we should. 
   So that is one of the critical solutions that I think we have got to work on. 
   Let us cut out this bureaucracy. What is wrong with allowing parents to take their child to the doctor's office, just take them to the doctor's office and get the health care they need without creating all of this paperwork and bean counters in Tallahassee and bean counters in Washington that are having to spend a lot of time and a lot of our resources that could be going into the health care for our kids?

   Ms. CASTOR. Well, under the new Democratic Congress, I think we now can show some leadership when it comes to health care solutions. We have such expertise out in our country in the various universities and the medical schools and with the researchers, and it is time for a little leadership on wellness care and preventive medicine. 
   I was listening very intently to President Bush last week, hoping that he would be true to his conservative principles and say we need to conserve energy and you need to be conservative in how you take care of yourself. 
   I think now is the time for Democrats to provide this kind of leadership on diabetes, obesity prevention that is running rampant among our children. 
   How do you prevent heart disease? Show how important it is to exercise, eat well and sleep. These are simple things that if we commit as a country to wellness and preventive care, we are sure to save millions of dollars later when it comes to funding Medicare and those types of programs.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6052, SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1304 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 6052, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008. The resolution provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and makes in order five amendments submitted for consideration. 
   The rule also permits the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules relating to two important measures: one, a measure concerning the Commodity Exchange Act and energy markets; and two, a measure concerning the issuance of oil and gas leases on Federal lands or waters. This authority is needed because House rules allow for bills to be considered under suspension only on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. In order for the House to consider the bill today on Thursday or on any other day, the House must adopt a rule granting specific permission. 
   Madam Speaker, hardworking Americans all across this great country are being squeezed by this painful Bush economy that has brought on increased costs for housing and for health care. My colleague from Florida can attest to the rising costs of property insurance for Floridians and other Americans, and of course, gas prices are socking it to our neighbors back home. 
   Now, many of the reformers here in Congress have been standing up to the White House and have been urging them for years to change direction and to focus on long-term solutions to our energy challenges. But the oil men at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and their Big Oil allies have had a stranglehold over our country's energy policy, and unfortunately, families and businesses across America are paying the price. 
   Now, some bipartisan progress has been made here in our new-direction Congress over the past year and a half. One of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi's first initiatives was to establish a new bipartisan Select Committee on Energy Independence and Climate Change, which has been extremely productive. Democratic reformers also pushed through a historic increase in the required gas mileage of 35 miles per gallon for our cars. Now, better gas mileage for our cars alone should save families from $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump and should slash consumption in America by 4 million gallons per day, but it cannot happen soon enough. The sad thing is this technology has existed for years. Cars in Japan travel almost twice as far on a gallon of gas. 
   What has been missing here in our country is the political leadership to make these necessary changes. So many of the changes we have been fighting for have been blocked by the White House and by their Big Oil allies. 
   Remember, just 7 years ago, the administration's Energy Task Force met behind closed doors, and it consisted of former oil company executives and of other oil executives, like Ken Lay of Enron. The administration also fought to keep the other identities secret. Saving American families money through innovation was not a priority. Conservation was not a priority--the Vice President made that clear--and public transit and public transportation were not priorities. They were stuck in the past then, and they still are today because what has been their answer to high gas prices? Their recommendations today are the same as they were 7 years ago: More drilling; more of the same. 
   Now, as the reformers in this Congress continue to fight for a new direction in energy policy, inexplicably, the White House announced yesterday that it opposes today's public transit bill, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act. What a shame on the White House, because expanding public transportation use is one of the most promising ways to reduce energy consumption and reliance on foreign oil. 
   Now, with the White House's $4-per-gallon premium, even more commuters are choosing to ride the train and to bus to work rather than to ride alone in their cars. According to two recent studies, America already saves up to 1 1/2 to 4 billion gallons of gasoline annually. That's more than 11 million gallons of gasoline per day due to public transit. 
   Ridership across America is way up. 2007 was the highest ridership in public transportation in 50 years. Light rail riders are way up in Denver, Seattle, Portland, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Francisco, Charlotte, and in many other communities. And my colleague from Miami will be pleased to hear that South Florida posted a 20 percent increase over last year in ridership in March and April. Transit agencies are also using more alternative fuels and clean energy technologies that improve the air we breathe and that aid America's energy independence. 
   Our transit bill on the floor today and under this rule will lower fares and will expand routes and frequency so public transit is an even more attractive alternative during this time of high gas prices. 
   So I urge my colleagues to continue to stand up to the White House, to support this rule and our first bill today, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act. 
   Madam Speaker, our second bill today under this rule is entitled ``Use It or Lose It.'' In the bill, we are calling the bluff of the White House, of Big Oil, and of other prominent Republicans who claim that oil companies are being blocked from drilling for oil and gas and that that is somehow related to gas prices. Well, after the White House announced that policy last week, one commentator called it a massive fraudulent and pathetic excuse for an energy policy. 
   You see, 68 million acres are already leased and have the potential to produce an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 4.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day. Now, if 68 million acres are already open to drilling, please do not insult the intelligence of the American people by claiming that the oil companies need more. 
   The truth about America's energy policy and the White House policy is that Big Oil has stockpiled supplies and has pocketed profits. A report has been generated by the Committee on Natural Resources, entitled ``The Truth About America's Energy: Big Oil Stockpiles Supplies and Pockets Profits'' of June 2008. If American families and businesses are interested, they can obtain this report on the Internet at resourcescommittee.house.gov. 
   The chairman of the Natural Resources Committee is Nick Rahall of West Virginia. It's his bill. The bill forces oil and gas companies to either produce, to use it or to release the leases, to lose them, the leases they've been stockpiling. These companies can't obtain new ones unless they can demonstrate that they are diligently using the ones that they already have. 
   Now, what was particularly interesting, Madam Speaker, is that, last  year, the administration's own energy department, the Energy Information Administration, issued a report that determined that opening more areas would not have a significant impact on gas prices. The 2007 report of the administration's Energy Information Administration, titled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2007, with Projections to 2030'' can be found at www.eia.doe.gov/oaif/aeo/. 
   In fact, Madam Speaker, just yesterday, the director of the EIA reconfirmed the 2007 report and noted that expanded offshore drilling in the U.S. will not affect oil and natural gas prices very much at all. 
   I would like to submit yesterday's reconfirmation by the EIA director of the 2007 report.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   The reformers in this Congress are working for solutions and are casting aside the politics of the past, and for the first time in a decade, they are setting the right priorities for American families. See, American families are caught in this very unfortunate Bush economy that is squeezing them, whether it's health care, the rising cost of housing, and, of course, gas prices. 
   This New Direction Congress, led by Democrats, is on the side of middle class families, and we are responding to their call for change in the direction of this country. But, Madam Speaker, it has not been easy. It has not been easy in these final years of the Bush administration. A number of times we have stood up to the administration to repeal the massive subsidies to the big oil companies and instead take that money and invest it in new renewable energies and biofuel technologies because one of the most promising ways to end our dependence on foreign oil is in the creation of renewable energy sources. But we were blocked by the White House and Big Oil. 
   But we are not going to give up. If we had given up, the reformers in this Congress would not have been able to push through the first increase in fuel economy standards in over 30 years. The increase of 35 miles per gallon for each automobile will save American families $700 to $1,000 at the pump when fully implemented. 
   American families are clamoring for a bold, new direction in energy policy. It is vital to their family budgets, and we know now, as, unfortunately, the leaders of the country have had to traipse over to Saudi Arabia and ask for more oil, that this is vital to our national security. So the contrast between the policies of the past and our forward-looking efforts could not be more clear. 
   But, Madam Speaker, it is so easy to be frustrated by the misguided policies of this administration over the past 8 years and by their political gimmicks where they pretend that drilling for oil in new areas is the answer to high gas prices when their very own Energy Department dismisses the idea as untrue. After all, there are 68 million acres already open and currently leased to oil and gas companies. So why here at the end of this administration would we give Big Oil even more? 
   Madam Speaker, American families are counting on us. So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to back up your rhetoric with support for our bipartisan bills today, to provide American families with greater opportunities to use public transit by lowering fares and by increasing the frequency of buses and trains in their neighborhoods. Reject the oil drilling gimmick for what it is, and urge this President to address the oil speculators that are causing a run-up in high gas prices. My colleagues, stand up to the powerful interests, and end the practice of using energy policy as a way to support Big Oil. Instead, help our families; help our communities; enable researchers and innovators to lead us to a cleaner, safer, and more affordable future. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the rule and of the underlying legislation. Chart a new direction for America on energy. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, we've been working diligently to improve Medicare for America's seniors. In fact, on June 24, the Democratic-led House of Representatives passed by a large bipartisan margin, 355-59, critical Medicare legislation. Unfortunately, it's being blocked by the White House and Republicans across the Capitol. 
   I urge the White House and Republicans in the other body to stop siding with private health insurance companies and, instead, join us in standing up for families who rely on Medicare. 
   Our Medicare bill is critical to the health of our neighbors. It helps ensure that seniors have access to high quality health care and the doctor of their choice. 
   Health care for our military families and retirees is also linked to our Medicare bill, and the Military Officers Association is calling on the White House and Republicans to end their opposition. 
   Our legislation cuts overpayments and wasteful subsidies to private managed-care insurance companies and redirects these resources to where they belong: the health of our seniors.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, as we reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, we take an important and critical new step to help the world preserve and restore its natural resources and vital ecosystems. This reauthorization will continue our efforts to preserve the world's forests, coral reefs, and associated coastal marine ecosystems. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will create an invaluable debt-for-nature exchange that not only benefits the global economy, but also the global environment. 
   Protecting our natural resources is a daunting responsibility, and coral reefs present unique challenges to protect and rebuild. They are fragile, slow-growing, and easily damaged by passing ships, changes in temperature, or severe weather. Despite these challenges, they are an integral part of our environment. Corals support economies, protect coastlines, and act as ecosystems for thousands of species of sea life. They may also provide information for the development of new drugs or understandings of human disease. 
   The Florida Aquarium, a non-profit education and research institution in Tampa, has extensive experience in developing cutting edge technologies and protocols for coral conservation, including how to safely introduce cultured coral onto wild reefs. This facility has pioneered the methods and technology needed to confidently direct a coral health certificate program wherein aquacultured corals are certified as safe for introduction into the wild. Until the Florida Aquarium developed this certification technique for artificially aquacultured coral, there was no acceptable solution for doing so. This made rebuilding reefs time-consuming and expensive, and often led to the destruction of the wild coral that scientists were trying to restore. Today, the Florida Aquarium continues to lead the scientific community as the only institution in the world that can certify aquacultured coral for wild reefs. 
   Mr. Speaker, developing countries participating in our debt relief initiative could greatly benefit from the Florida Aquarium's technology and expertise. I strongly encourage the coral initiatives under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act to seek out the Florida Aquarium as a resource in rehabilitating coral reefs world wide. I am proud to support this important legislation in its effort to preserve our natural resources.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 793 provides for consideration of H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order three amendments that are included in the Rules Committee report. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 and passage of this rule. By passing this bipartisan legislation today, the House of Representatives will take another step, important step, towards equality for all Americans. 
   During the 230-year-plus history of our great Nation, the march towards equality under the law for all of our citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady. Over time, Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace, based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion and disability, because when it comes to employment and hiring and firing and compensation and promotion, these decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance.     
   Sometimes the fight for equality has been slow in coming indeed. This legislation that outlaws job discrimination based upon sexual orientation that the Congress will pass today was first introduced over 30 years ago. 
   It is long past time to ensure that no one in our country can be discriminated against and fired from their job based upon who they are, whether it is their race, their color, whether they are a man or a woman, or whether they are gay. Private companies across America know this and are way ahead of the politicians here in Washington. 
   Many of our neighbors back home would be shocked to learn that millions of Americans can be fired from their jobs or refused work or paid less and otherwise subjected to employment discrimination without regard for the quality of their work and without any recourse under Federal law. While many States, cities, and counties across the country have outlawed job discrimination on their own, many States and localities have not. I am proud that the cities of Tampa and St. Petersburg that I represent have outlawed job discrimination against gays and lesbians, but our counties have not, unfortunately. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act protects all Americans, no matter where they live, by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, and refuse to promote employees based upon a person's sexual orientation. See, in America no person should have to worry about the security of their job because of their sexual orientation. Our country bases employment evaluation on hard work and on a job well done. Making employment decisions on anything else is unacceptable. In fact, 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies in the United States have adopted policies similar to the legislation that the Congress will pass today. And a broad coalition of businesses and community organizations strongly support this landmark civil rights legislation, including the Human Rights Campaign; the Anti-Defamation League; Central Conference of American Rabbis; the National Education Association; the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and, I am proud to say, the NAACP. 
   I am proud that this Congress will stand up for equality for all Americans and stand behind our values and understanding that we do not discriminate against our neighbors for any reason, and we should be able to live comfortably with the knowledge that our neighbors will not discriminate against us. The passage of this legislation will remove a legitimate fear that exists among us that we may lose our job and be unable to provide for our families when someone decides to exercise intolerance and prejudices against us and our neighbors in the workplace. 
   Thanks to extraordinary leaders in Congressman BARNEY FRANK, Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN, Chairman George Miller, Congressman ROB ANDREWS, Congressman CHRIS SHAYS, Congresswoman DEBORAH PRYCE, and so many others that will stand up for Americans here in this body today and pass this law, I thank them for their leadership and their commitment to equality for all Americans. And I agree with them that passing this historic nondiscrimination act will bring our Nation closer to our goal and our promise of equality for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is sensitive to religious organizations and our fundamental religious beliefs and tenets, and it includes a very broad religious exemption. In fact, we are going to debate later on the Miller amendment that, if adopted, would make clear that ENDA exempts the same group of religious organizations that are currently exempt from prohibition on religious discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   Now, we know not everyone, not every employer will agree that gay people should be protected from employment discrimination. But for the betterment and advancement of our society as a whole, ENDA would overrule that judgment so that Americans are treated fairly and equally. But nothing in ENDA or in any civil rights law that has come before us in the history of this country affects the ability, the God-given right of a person to hold contrary beliefs based on religion or otherwise. 
   At this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).

   This point of order is being raised today for one purpose and one purpose only, that is, to block this rule and ultimately the underlying bill, an underlying bill that prohibits discrimination against Americans with mental illness. 
   I'm heartened by the fact that I do not believe the gentleman's point of order comes from a unanimous opinion of the other side of the aisle because the underlying bill is a bipartisan effort cosponsored by 274 Members of the House of Representatives. Yet there are opponents of this bill, and they will raise these dilatory tactics. The opponents don't even want to allow a debate or a final vote on this critical measure. They simply want to stop the process and kill the bill through this procedural maneuver. 
   So despite whatever dilatory procedural devices the other side tries to use to stop this bill, we will stand up for the millions of Americans who need parity in mental health coverage, and we will vote to consider this important legislation today. 
   We must consider this rule, and we will pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1014 provides for the consideration of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, which expands the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 to provide for equity in the terms of employer-sponsored health benefits for mental health and substance-related disorders compared to medical and surgical disorders. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an anti-discrimination bill, this is a health care bill, this is a pro-business economic development bill, this is also a pro-family bill, and this is a bill that supports our veterans. This is a bipartisan effort, with 274 cosponsors in the House, of which I am proud to be one. 
   Unfortunately, Federal action is necessary because Americans who suffer from illnesses like depression, postpartum depression, severe anxiety, bipolar disorder, and many other diseases are being discriminated against. You see, HMOs and many health insurance companies have been more focused on their bottom lines than on the health of our families. Mental health is just as critical to our lives and well-being as any physical ailments or disease. And yet health insurers continue to treat mental illness differently from physical illness. 
   In America, more than 50 million adults, at least 22 percent of the U.S. population, suffer from mental health issues or substance abuse disorders. In addition, one out of every 10 children or adolescents has a serious mental health problem and another 10 percent have mild to moderate problems. Untreated mental illness harms our families and children, emotionally and financially. Untreated mental illness results in higher costs for businesses in lost productivity. Untreated mental illness often leads to criminal activity, which is very costly. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability for individuals aged 15 to 44 in the United States. 
   A study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health revealed that mental and addictive disorders cost our country more than $300 billion annually. This includes productivity losses of $150 billion, health care costs of over $70 billion, and $80 billion for costs such as criminal justice. 
   Unfortunately, less than one-third of the people with a mental disorder who seek care receive adequate treatment. Despite the losses suffered in our society as a result of mental illness and all of the studies that demonstrate this, national employer survey data indicates that mental health coverage still is not offered at comparable coverage to other medical conditions.     
   Even after passage of the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act and all of the efforts of the States, the Government Accountability Office found that 87 percent of plans had more restrictive design features for mental health benefits than for medical and surgical benefits. In addition, many employers have adopted restrictive measures, such as limiting the number of covered outpatient visits for mental illness. This is so shortsighted. It is so costly. 
   Former Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher found that when health insurance plans unevenly impose higher costs for mental health services, the result, of course, is a reduction in treatment for those who need it, lost productivity and higher costs in the long run. Dr. Satcher stated that this is a true issue of fairness in coverage. 
   Similarly, another recent study found that deductibles and outpatient cost sharing were much higher for substance abuse than for general medical care. Well, this legislation addresses those inequities and provides a cost-effective way of providing increased access to mental health care. The bill prohibits discrimination by diagnosis by requiring coverage of all mental illnesses and substance-related disorders, just as we provide for Members of Congress and others covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Treatment for mental illness is a proven money-saver. In fact, for every $1 spent on treatment, we save over $12. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Kennedy of Rhode Island and Mr. Ramstad of Minnesota for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation and their work to provide for the mental health needs of our families, our neighbors, our veterans and our children. We also owe great thanks to the Wellstone family. But, most of all, we can't forget the families throughout America who have a modest request of their Congress, and that is that they be treated fairly. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this is truly a good-news story for American families today, because not only are we going to outlaw discrimination against those who suffer from mental illness, but we adhere to the pay-as-you-go rules that were adopted by this Congress, led by Democrats, at the beginning of this Congress. Pay-as-you-go means that this bill is paid for.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   This amendment commissions a GAO study to examine the effect of the new multi-peril coverage option which is established as an option in this bill on State insurers and catastrophe funds like those in my State of Florida. This amendment works very well with the initiative of Chairman Frank and my colleague from Florida, Ms. Brown-Waite, and their very thoughtful initiatives. But it builds upon it. 
   And the particular problem in my State of Florida is that the State insurance company, Citizens, now holds 1.3 million policies. Citizens is supposed to be an insurer of last resort; but because private insurance companies have left the State, they've withdrawn from the market, Citizens has ballooned to over 40 percent of the property wind insurance market. Citizens, however, does not have the reserves, the sufficient financial reserves, we believe, to pay the level of claims that would result from a catastrophic hurricane. In the event of a serious storm, Citizens may be forced to turn to public funds again. 
   The new multi-peril option, I know it's in dispute now, but however you feel about it, we need to get to the bottom of the effect it will have on our  State insurers and catastrophic funds. It could offer new fiscally sound choices for those in high-risk areas. It has the potential to help address wind insurance availability so that the public is not on the hook for claims when the next storm hits. 
   If the new option is successful in making insurance available to areas where private insurers refuse to go, multi-peril and this wind storm option could relieve the pressure on State insurers like Citizens in Florida. But serious questions remain to be answered about how these State and Federal programs will interact. 
   Will State insurers leave room in the market for an actuarially based Federal program to achieve high enough enrollment to make a difference? 
   Will State policies change to help their citizens take advantage of the Federal multi-peril program? 
   How will enrollment rates of State plans change to reflect the new Federal entrant into the market? 
   These are important questions for both Congress and States to ask. There will also undoubtedly be interaction between State and Federal programs that will affect enrollment in ways that we cannot anticipate. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, the study commissioned in this bill will provide vital information to help officials at all levels of government work together to better understand and administer the new multi-peril and wind storm option. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment will help protect homeowners in coastal areas from windstorms by ensuring that natural wind barriers remain intact. It instructs the Director of FEMA to consider natural protective sand dunes and wetlands when developing criteria for the multi-peril insurance. No matter how you feel about the multi-peril option in this bill, I think everyone will agree that it is in our country's best interest to discourage any investment of public dollars in those areas. 
   One of the most sensible features of the National Flood Insurance Program is the requirement that in order to remain eligible, communities must enact strong growth management laws, flood mitigation strategies that will help prevent catastrophic losses rather than just responding to them when they occur. The bill we are considering today expands the national flood insurance with an optional wind component. Just like flood policies, wind policies will be contingent on prevention and mitigation activities developed by FEMA. 
   While it's absolutely imperative that homeowners themselves take the initiative to prepare their properties for windstorms, some of the best mitigation and prevention measures naturally exist along the coast. So no matter what your opinion is of the multi-peril option, if government is going to offer a multi-peril option for windstorm damage, our interest should be in doing all we can do to reduce the risk side of the equation. In the event of a hurricane, wetlands and coastal dunes act as shock absorbers, and these natural environmental features bear the brunt of the monumental pounding of wind so that homes, businesses, and schools don't have to. 
   I am also going to recognize another colleague, but at this time I urge approval of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, the Federal multi-peril option must not be an invitation to develop on our sensitive natural coasts, and we must protect the natural windbreaks like the coastal dune areas. That is why it is important to instruct FEMA, as they develop the eligibility criteria for the multi-peril program, that they must take into account the natural protective features. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and protect the natural wind barriers that will make damage mitigation efforts more manageable.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, I am proud today to stand with this Congress as it affirms its commitment to the brave men and women who are part of our active and retired military services. Their collective sacrifice and service has been phenomenal, and we must do all we can to ensure that they receive the medical care that they have earned as a result of the sacrifices they have made in service to America. The bill before us provides an historic, substantial boost to the Veterans' Administration, allocating $43.2 billion--$3.8 billion more than the President's request and $6.7 more than the FY 07 allocation--to properly fulfill America's obligation to our servicemen and women and their families. 
   As a representative of the State with the second highest population of military retirees and veterans--nearly 2 million people--I know many Florida families stand to benefit greatly. The extra funding for the VA to double its benefits personnel in order to reduce the backlog of more than 400,000 benefit claims will do much to improve health care and efficiency for benefits that are due to many Florida families. The top two busiest VA Health Care centers, Bay Pines in St. Petersburg and Haley VA in Tampa, serve residents in my district. I have walked the halls of both facilities, and encountered active and retired military personnel looking for the best care possible for them and their families. This bill provides resources adequate to the enormously important task of supporting our veterans and their families as they transition back into civilian life. It also expands access to vital services in the areas of greatest concern for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan: traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment for burns, and amputation. Haley VA has the distinction of being one of a handful of poly-trauma centers, with special designation to handle traumatic brain injuries, and with its partner, the University Of South Florida College Of Public Health, has been on the forefront of discovering the best roads to effective treatment for those suffering with TBI. 
   Also, this bill represents the recognition that we must confront, not shy away from, the serious issues in veterans care brought to light by the Walter Reed scandal. $4.1 billion dollars, $508 million above and beyond the President's request, is set aside for the ongoing maintenance and renovation of existing facilities to make certain they remain capable of delivering our veterans the treatment they deserve and need. It also heavily invests in information technology to better track health records, so that no American is allowed to fall through the cracks. 
   I urge this Congress to back up the talk about supporting our troops with concrete actions. We have an unwavering obligation as a country to do right by our servicemen and women, whether it be in the solemn purpose with which we must always send them off to war, or in providing the necessary care for them and their families upon their return. Their sacrifice must be respected not just with our words, but with our actions.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6899, COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the distinguished chairwoman from the Rules Committee. 
   I rise in support of the landmark Comprehensive Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act and this rule. This represents the culmination of years of debate over energy policy. And it does contain numerous measures that have already been adopted by this body in a bipartisan fashion, but most importantly, this compromise energy bill represents fundamental change in the country's energy future and a significant break with White House policies that give little priority to ending the Nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   Instead, this is the kind of comprehensive and balanced energy initiative that the American people have been calling for because it diversifies our Nation's energy portfolio and invests in new technologies and innovation. For example, we are going to make historic new investments in renewable energy through incentives for solar power and wind power that will have an additional benefit of producing thousands of new jobs across America. 
   We have the technology to save energy and to save consumers significant money. And this bill strengthens energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings and promotes conservation as well. And American families could use a little cost savings right now. This energy bill also dramatically expands domestic supply and oil drilling because we realize that excessive entanglements in the Middle East do not serve our national security interests. 
   The contrast between the policies of the past and our forward-looking bill could not be more clear. There are real differences. Remember just 7 years ago the administration's Energy Task Force met behind closed doors. It consisted of oil company executives. And the administration fought tooth and nail to keep those meetings secret. Renewable sources of energy were not a priority, and a balanced comprehensive approach was not a priority. 
   So here is the question: Do the American people continue to subsidize big oil companies while they are making record profits, or do we shift our investment to cleaner, renewable fuels?     
   I know it has been difficult for some to stand up to the White House and the big oil companies. But the American people are demanding it. We must make this transition and set new innovative priorities for this country when it comes to energy. Our ground-breaking effort, our reform and our new policy set this country on a path toward energy independence, particularly from the Middle East. So today we will cast aside the policies of the past and start down a path based upon the right energy priorities for America. 
   I congratulate Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for her leadership in crafting this compromise future-oriented bill, and I thank my colleagues and the American people for their commitment to a new energy future for America. 
   I urge adoption of this landmark energy bill and this rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1503 waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII, which requires a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. This waiver would apply to any rule reported on the legislative day of September 26, 2008 that provides for consideration or disposition of a measure making supplemental appropriations for job creation and preservation, infrastructure investment, and economic and energy assistance for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a humble first-term Representative who represents hundreds of thousands of hardworking families and seniors who are caught in the center of an economic storm. For them, the economic squeeze did not arise last week or last month, but it has been ongoing for well over a year. 
   I also rise as the daughter of parents who worked hard all of their lives and saved for retirement and, like millions of Americans, they are watching their savings dwindle and decline. And I rise as a parent, who, along with my husband, is saving for our children's college education. 
   For students and families across America, the cost of attending college has risen. And as we look out to future years, like other parents, our college savings accounts for our kids feel a little less tangible now, and I fear that college for students may be a little less attainable unless we act in a bipartisan way this week. 
   Many middle class American families are unable to even save now for retirement or their children's college fund because they've lost a job, or if they do have a job, the raise did not come, or the raise came, and it was not enough to meet the rising cost of living in America today. 
   So at this time, as our country's leaders join together to develop a rescue plan--which has been dramatically altered from the beginning of the week when it was proposed in a two-and-a-half page proposal to spend $700 billion--we must join together, Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan way to provide a lifeline to families as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must stand up for everyday Americans. While stabilizing financial markets on the day of the largest bank failure in history is vitally important, correspondingly, stabilizing families and taxpayers is just as important. American families need a little breathing room, and they need a job if they're out of work. So it is our moral imperative, at this moment in history, to examine this modest stimulus proposal, create jobs back home through an infusion of cash for infrastructure projects, for unemployment benefits, and for health care dollars for Americans who have no other place to turn. 
   This stimulus package will jump-start America's economy. And here's our action plan: 
   First; jobs, jobs, jobs through infrastructure investments. We're talking about highways, transit capital grants, Amtrak, airport improvements. Do you know how many thousands of construction jobs have been let go and we have lost across America? This will put Americans back to work. 
   We're also going to provide resources to our local communities to help them with clean water projects, sewer projects, the Corps of Engineers, Mississippi River and tributaries, and also vital--and I speak as a parent of two young daughters--school construction dollars. 
   We also provide, as part of our action plan, energy development dollars for energy efficiency and renewable energy, electricity delivery, and reliability programs. That is the major portion of our economic stimulus proposal for American families. 
   We will also provide unemployment compensation and job training dollars, which seems oh so modest because it totals merely $6 billion. It's modest in the face of a proposal this week to spend $700 billion, unfettered, at the beginning of the week. 
   We will also respond to the least among us, Medicaid dollars. Now, that's a term that gets thrown around a lot, but I want the American people to understand that when we talk Medicaid--and you will hear the discussion here today will be FMAP, Federal Medical Assistance Percentage in Medicaid. What Medicaid is is largely health care dollars for children from poor families. Now, many middle class families are now slipping into that lower socioeconomic level today. Their parents don't have health insurance. If they're working, they're working maybe at a small business or part-time, and there is no other place to turn during this dire economic downturn. 
   The least we can do, when we're discussing a bailout for Wall Street and for banks and financial markets, is to also consider, at the same time, a very modest proposal of $60 billion for America's families, for jobs, for health care for kids, seniors who have no other place to turn, and unemployment compensation. 
   First, on jobs. You know, today's wages are stagnant; they're at the most stagnant point that they have been since World War II. Medium household income was .6 percent lower in 2007 than it was at the end of the 1990s. And even more troubling are the rising inequities of incomes among families in different communities. Data released from the Joint Economic Committee reports that over the past decade, median incomes for the richest households have risen while middle and low-income families have seen their income fall. 
   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 9.4 million Americans--a 6.1 percent increase--in August, the highest it has been since 2003. This continues the unfortunate job loss for the  eighth consecutive month, with over 600,000 American jobs lost this year. 
   Unemployment benefits under our action plan will be extended for merely another 7 weeks, a very modest proposal. It extended in every State an additional 13 weeks, and an additional 13 weeks in States with unemployment rates higher than 6 percent, like my home State of Florida. 
   Florida families have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn. In the past year, Florida has lost over 100,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate continues to rise. The housing crisis has dragged down job opportunities in construction and other related fields, and we keep seeing continued joblessness and layoffs. At the same time, in Florida we have seen a 21 percent increase in families receiving food stamps over the past year, which is one of the highest increases in the Nation. 
   But fortunately, under this stimulus plan, we're going to immediately take action to fund new jobs through infrastructure projects. See, investing in infrastructure can rapidly move people from unemployment rolls to payrolls. Just this week, we heard our Republican Governor, Charlie Christ, sent his DOT secretary to the Hill to meet with the bipartisan Florida delegation. She advised that there are projects ready to go, have been permitted, are ready to go. So this action plan will take those projects off the shelf and put people to work building roads, building bridges, sewer projects all across America. 
   For hundreds of thousands of Floridians who are unemployed, and other Americans, they're still looking for work, and this package will help them find a job. It's that simple.     
   On health care, on the Medicaid portion which remember largely goes to health care services for children so they can get to the doctors' office, seniors in nursing homes and pregnant women, this stimulus package will improve and bolster that health care safety net at this critical time in our Nation's history. Unlike the hope of trickle-down, this action plan and economic stimulus project is a rapid and effective way to support those hardworking families. 
   During the last economic downturn, the Congress approved $10 billion to temporarily enhance the health care safety net of Medicaid. This similar increase today will again provide vital, basic health services to families that need it most as quickly as possible. And at the same time, an increase in health care funding will help families who are not served by Medicaid but are taking up the slack in this economy, that are paying higher premiums and co-pays because the charity care in the emergency room, someone has to pay for that. And that usually is tacked on to the cost of the typical family's employer-provided health care cost. Higher co-pays and higher premiums are a direct result of many families in this country not having anyplace else to turn for health care. 
   In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Center for Studying Health System Change released a report yesterday that says that employees are paying more medical expenses out of their own pockets. They're having a harder time coming up with money to pay their bills. The study displayed the mounting additional strain that medical care is placing on working Americans. It is estimated that 57 million Americans live in families struggling with medical bills, and 43 million of those have health insurance coverage. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret across America that with stagnant wages and a higher cost of living, be it health care, be it higher gas prices, be it home heating oil, be it, in Florida, property insurance, that we have got to take action for them. And it cannot simply be a trickle-down rescue package. It also needs to be a very modest, but at the same time meaningful, support for families. 
   When we are able to provide additional moneys to States for health care and for infrastructure and jobs, what this does is it takes the pressure off all other programs that are funded by our State and local governments, including education. In my State of Florida, they have had to cut billions and billions of dollars out of our State budget. Unbelievably, for the first time in many decades, this year the State of Florida ratcheted back the amount of money provided per student in our public school system. The State university chancellor of the State of Florida announced yesterday that there is a freeze on new students being allowed into the Florida college system because they simply do not have the resources during this economic downturn to provide a seat for new freshmen in our colleges and universities. 
   Mr. Speaker, economists agree that any stimulus package must put money in the hands of those who will spend it right away in order to stimulate the economy. This package will do just that by focusing funding where it is needed most, creating jobs, jobs, jobs through infrastructure, enhancing the health care safety net for our children and our seniors and providing a lifeline to American families who are struggling during this economic downturn. 
   At this point, I will reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, the economic crisis for many American families did not begin this week. The economic squeeze has been ongoing for a long time. For example, just this summer in my district in the Tampa Bay area that I have the privilege to represent, we held foreclosure workshops for families facing foreclosure, maybe they had just gotten their first notice. I was shocked, hundreds of families showed up at the workshop where we sat them down with a lender, one on one, to try to begin that workout period. It was great. They could get a little grace period, they could get a little breathing room. I heard numerous stories about a lost job in a family, something that was completely unanticipated. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time when our Nation's leaders are meeting in a bipartisan way with the White House, the leaders here in the Congress, the folks at Treasury, listening to experts from all around the country and listening to everyday, average Americans weigh in on this emergency situation, I think it is very important that all of our colleagues hear the American people. 
   If you vote for this rule and the underlying bill, I think everyone here can prove that they are listening and hear the American people and understand their struggles today, understand that they have lost jobs. And that's what this package will provide--jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to expedite infrastructure projects across the country, bridge building, road building, put a lot of these folks that have been put out of work in the construction sector back to work. 
   Health care, health care services for our children and for our seniors that do not have any place else to turn. Hear the American people, hear their voices. It is not just health care for those children and the seniors that have nowhere else to turn, but it takes the burden off all the rest who are paying higher copays and higher premiums. They won't have to pick up that tab that is being put upon them unfairly because everyone is going to the emergency room for primary care. Hear the American people. 
   I think that most of the Nation's leaders are taking this very seriously. They are meeting right now to address the emergency. But part of the emergency response must be carving a modest sliver directly for people at home. 
   At the beginning of the week, the administration came with a 2 1/2 page proposal for $700 billion. People got to work. Everyone understood that was unreasonable. You can't give a blank check. So they went back to the drawing board and ratcheted it back, and they keep working on it. But think about it, $700 billion that a lot of experts thought was okay for Wall Street, largely; and what we are asking for here is $60 billion for families, for jobs, for health care for kids and our seniors, to give breathing room for unemployment compensation for a few more weeks to, hopefully, get them through this emergency. 
   I really do appreciate the White House's response to this because yesterday after their meeting, they did not rule out this stimulus package. They don't like what the Senate is doing. It is a little different there, but this is serious business. Do you hear the American people? 
   It is our moral imperative at this time of emergency to hear the American people. Now, most of us weren't around during the Great Depression, but I know there are many people who are students of history and love to read about FDR and how he handled that crisis. Hopefully we are not there yet. Hopefully these times are not as dire as the times that I heard about from my parents and grandparents. 
   But let's act now to ensure that we do not face such hard times. 
   Mr. Speaker, do you hear the American people? Do you hear what they are saying about their retirement accounts? Do you hear what they are saying about their saving for college for their kids? 
   I hope all of our colleagues hear the American people, support this rule, support this job creation and infrastructure investment package. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Chairman, I would like to express my support of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act. 
   I would like to thank Chairwoman WATERS and Chairman FRANK  for their hard work on behalf of American families. I am proud to support their effort to make the dream of homeownership reachable for hard-working families throughout our country. 
   H.R. 1852 accomplishes many goals. It will expand the capacity of the FHA to ultimately help more homebuyers receive better loans. Currently subprime borrowers are not eligible to receive FHA loans. Under H.R. 1852, FHA loans will become available to subprime borrowers and help to keep them from becoming victims of predatory lending practices when buying their first homes. 
   Families who are currently homeowners, but were placed into mortgages that they were unable to afford will be eligible under H.R. 1852 to refinance their mortgages with the FHA. This will help families to recover from the hardship that so many have experienced during this difficult period in the mortgage market. 
   One of the great provisions of the Expanding American Homeownership Act is that it will authorize up to $300 million per year to be put into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to assist in building more affordable housing for working families. This fund will work alongside of an effort in my home state of Florida by Governor Charlie Crist to increase funding for initiatives to build affordable housing and to provide added assistance to first-time home buyers. 
   In my district in the Tampa Bay area, 10,173 of my neighbors found that their homes fell into foreclosure within the first six months of this year. The Tampa Bay area is ranked 24th in home foreclosures among the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the country. 
   On Monday, members of my community gathered to hear the story of Isaline Wyatte. Isaline's lender told her last month that her house was going to be auctioned off. Isaline was facing foreclosure. Fortunately, Isaline was proactive and was able to take the needed steps to finding assistance to restructure her loan and keep her home. Isaline's journey was a struggle, but with the passage of H.R. 1852, homeowners like Isaline will have an added place to turn before foreclosure threatens to leave their families without a home. 
   Madam Chairman, there are thousands of children, seniors and veterans that are living in fear that soon they will lose their homes. This is a crisis and H.R. 1852 is an excellent step toward helping not only first-time homebuyers, but also to help homeowners in trouble to get back onto their feet. Families will have a greater opportunity to find a home and stay in that home.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 691 commending the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its great contribution to the appreciation, understanding, and future of the United States Armed Forces, the City of Houston, Texas, and Ellington Field. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Nick Lampson, for bringing this measure to the floor of the House. 
   The Wings Over Houston Airshow is one of the highest rated events of its kind. This coming Saturday and Sunday, folks from Congressman Lampson's district and, in fact, from all over America, will come to see these mighty military machines maneuver through the skies with seeming ease. These classic and contemporary airframes break their bounds to Earth and share the heavens with the sun and clouds. 
   It's a rare experience to see with your own eyes the awe-inspiring airborne arsenal of our Armed Forces. It's difficult to explain the seemingly impossible coordination our pilots execute in midair. No one can truly understand the peril, skill, and thrill involved except for the pilots themselves; yet our extraordinarily talented men and women fly in conditions that require nothing less than perfection. And visitors will have that rare glimpse of airborne art. 
   Spectators will be visited by the Texas Air National Guard 147th Fighter Squadron. Their TANG F-16s will tear rifts through the sky as they buzz by. The Texas Air National Guard F-16s are at a state of constant readiness, prepared to defend the great State of Texas and our Nation at a moment's call. 
   Attendees will also have the chance to see Canadian Forces Snowbirds, the P-38, the B-24A, a heritage flight consisting of the F-4 Phantom, the P-51 Mustang, the P-47 Thunderbolt, and the F-15E Strike Eagle, and a number of Navy fighters among them. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston Airshow provides an important experience for folks to understand and to see the many machines that help our brave men and women in uniform protect us. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 691. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (HONORING THE SACRIFICES AND COMMITMENTS OF THE MEN, WOMEN, AND FAMILIES OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 640, to honor the sacrifices and commitments of the men, women, and families of the United States Transportation Command, or TRANSCOM. 
   Today marks the 20th anniversary of TRANSCOM's activation at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, and I would like to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Costello) for bringing this measure before the House. 
   Charged with the vital duty of providing air, land and sea transportation for the Department of Defense, both in times of peace and war, TRANSCOM consists of the Air Mobility Command, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, and the Military Sea Lift Command. 
   Established in 1978, TRANSCOM is the single manager of America's global defense transportation system, and its skilled coordination allows our country to project and sustain our Armed Forces whenever, wherever and for as long as they are needed. 
   Responding quickly and effectively to the demands of our warfighting commanders, TRANSCOM first proved its crucial capability during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, with the movement of more than 500,000 passengers, 3.7 million tons of dry cargo, and 6.1 million tons of petroleum products in only 7 months. 
   TRANSCOM has continued to serve the Nation and the world through many contingency and peacekeeping operations around the globe. It has supported numerous humanitarian relief operations, transporting supplies to victims of foreign and domestic natural disasters. 
   Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, TRANSCOM became an especially vital asset to our Nation, supporting our Armed Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   From October 2001 to September 2007, TRANSCOM and its components have transported approximately 4 million passengers, 9 million tons of cargo, and over 4 billion gallons of fuel. House Resolution 640 honors these great achievements and the men and women who make them happen. 
   TRANSCOM provides a vital service to our Nation and enables our Armed Forces to carry out their missions effectively and efficiently. 
   I hope you will join me today in congratulating TRANSCOM on its 20th anniversary, and expressing gratitude to the 155,000 men and women who comprise it for their continued sacrifice and commitment to this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 640.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2779 to honor the legacy of the Navy SEALs by recognizing the Navy Underwater Demolition Team Sea, Air, Land, or UDT-SEAL, Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the official national museum of Navy SEALs and their predecessors. I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Mahoney) for bringing this measure to the floor of the House. 
   Since the program's inception in 1962, the Special Operations Sailors, known as Navy SEALs, have risked their lives at sea, in the air and on land to protect the United States of America. The most elite fighting force in the world, the Navy SEALs have bravely executed some of the most dangerous combat operations in our Nation's history. Tracing the roots of these historic sailors, the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, marks the birthplace of the Navy frogmen where thousands of brave volunteers were trained to become the first members of naval combat demolition units and underwater demolition teams during World War II. The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum is the only museum dedicated solely to preserving the legacy of the Navy SEALs and its predecessors. 
   Since 1985 when the facility first opened, the museum served both as a physical monument to our sailors' bravery as well as an educational repository that preserves the legacy of their honor, skill, courage and patriotism. The museum traces the SEALs' lineage from the UDTs conducting hydrographic reconnaissance on the beaches of Normandy to the present-day professionals who practice conventional warfare and counterterrorism. The museum exhibits memorialize the incredible courage and versatility of the Navy SEALs through emphasizing eyewitness accounts and photographs of sailors on the battlefield as well as on the homefront. 
   The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, is an immensely important venture for the Navy underwater combat community as well as for the great State of Florida, preserving the rich history and valiant story of the Navy SEALs for both the program's veterans and future generations. 
   Our Nation can express its great admiration for these brave sailors and the gratitude for this monument to their sacrifices by recognizing the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the official national museum of Navy SEALs and their predecessors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2779, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 185, commending the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division of the Minnesota National Guard upon its completion of the longest continuous deployment of any United States military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I would like to thank my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) for bringing this measure before the House. 
   The 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division was deployed for 22 months, nearly 2 years. That's how long they were continuously deployed. This is longer than any other ground combat unit in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Many Americans count down the hours until the end of the workday, until Friday night, until the end of the work week. Often our commitment to our jobs comes in bundles of 40 hours. 
   Yet the soldiers of the Red Bull Division had no such luxury. Counting down the time until redeployment was computed in entire weeks, if not months. Just when they and their families thought they were to come home, their deployment was extended by an additional 125 days. 
   In 22 months some of our brave men and women in uniform missed their infants and their young children taking their first steps, saying their first words. Some of the roughly 5,000-member BCT missed their kids' high school graduations, and they didn't get a chance to move their sons and daughters into a dorm for college. 
   So much can change in 2 years. So many precious moments that we hold dear pass by during this time. Yet we go about our daily lives and forget that these precious moments that we enjoy are being protected by America's tremendous servicemembers. 
   Even more amazing is the fact that the members of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division are members of the National Guard. These are everyday folks, our neighbors and friends who signed up to be citizen soldiers. Their single deployment lasted as long as some active duty servicemembers' entire time in our Armed Forces. This was an extraordinary commitment and sacrifice on the part of the Red Bull Division. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Walz and Mr. Kline, our colleagues from Minnesota, will have much to say about these fine Minnesotans as representatives of that great State. But I would just like to say how proud I am as a Member of the United States House of Representatives and as an American, Mr. Speaker, of the 5,200 combat logistics patrols, the 2.4 million convoy miles, the 400 captured terrorists and the 22-month deployment that the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division accomplished. 
   We can never repay these servicemembers for their time and their tremendous sacrifice. But what we can do is enshrine our appreciation and thanks by passing this resolution into law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 185. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, in these challenging economic times, Americans everywhere are feeling the negative impact of President Bush's economic policies. More Americans are looking for work, millions have lost their homes or they are at risk, gas prices are at an all-time high, and in Florida property insurance is out of sight. 
   Now, the House has already taken action to address these issues, the housing crisis, credit, gas prices, but the Bush administration has been silent, or they have been actively opposed. That is until yesterday, when Treasury Secretary Paulson finally offered a proposal. But one bank analyst back home cautioned that the proposal is a political ploy. The Bush administration is just trying to reassure consumers that it has the financial crisis under control. ``All he's doing is moving the deck chairs,'' he said.  
   Well, I am very concerned as well that the announcement falls short in one key area. It does not address the immediate needs of American homeowners facing imminent foreclosure and the impact on our neighborhoods and communities. 
   We are going to work over the next few months for real action, as opposed to President Bush's hands-off approach.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my colleague, Ms. Sutton from Ohio, who is a true fighter for education reform for the working families of Ohio and all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the College Cost Reduction Act under this rule, as we are charting an historic new investment in our students and our communities. 
   All Americans should salute the leadership of Chairman George Miller and Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for their leadership in education and this single largest investment in higher education since the 1944 GI Bill. 
   Chairman Miller, on behalf of the students, colleges and universities in the State of Florida, I thank you for your dedication. And we also thank you in the State of Florida because you worked tirelessly with me and my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings, to ensure that students from States like Florida that have low tuition and low State support have access to additional need-based aid. 
   Passage of this act will increase access to college by making it more affordable. The cost of higher education in this country has skyrocketed over recent years. Thousands of students are left with overwhelming debt after graduation due to higher student loan rates and declining financial aid. Some may not make it to the college classroom at all because it has become so cost prohibitive. 
   In Florida, the average debt after college is more than $18,000 per student. But in America, no young person with a desire to learn should be barred from moving on to college due to financial hurdles, and this act removes many of those hurdles today. The College Cost Reduction Act cuts student loan interest rates in half and increases Pell Grants by at least $500 per student over the next 5 years. In the State of Florida alone, Federal loan and Pell Grant aid will increase by $762 million that will benefit over 340,000 students. In my home area, the Tampa Bay area, we have the ninth largest university in the country in the University of South Florida, over 40,000 students in that university. In addition, there is the University of Tampa, the Hillsborough Community College, Manatee Community College and St. Petersburg College. So let the message go forth to those students and those families that help is on the way, that they will not have to struggle with those higher student loan interest rates; they can depend on a little more help when it comes to the Pell Grant. 
   This bill also acknowledges that some high school students need a little extra help to be college ready, particularly students who may be the first in their family to attend college. We're going to keep these students on track to go to college and stand up for them and protect Federal dollars for their success. 
   We owe a debt of gratitude to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Bobby Scott, because he offered an amendment to this bill to maintain the Upward Bound program. I am proud to support his amendment which is contained in this bill that nationwide will protect the Upward Bound program. 
   In my hometown of Tampa, this means standing up for those students I met on Monday. I met with students at the great Middleton High School in Tampa. Jasmyn Hendricks and Clifton Tyson are students in the Upward Bound program at the University of South Florida. 
   Imagine a high school student that takes 20 Saturdays out of their life to learn about what it means to go to college, and then they spend their summers there, too. They are typically the first ones in their family to go to college. And we know that if they achieve their high school diploma, they will have a higher salary; but if they achieve their college degree, they are set up for success in life, and our communities benefit. 
   Jasmyn said to me, as her eyes welled up with tears, that before Upward Bound, I knew I wanted to pursue higher education, but there was no way. Jasmyn considers her Upward Bound program her second family. She said, There was no money. I just couldn't see a way for me to get to college after high school. Then Upward Bound comes along and introduces us to the fact there are college scholarships, grants and help. 
   Clifton, who is an athlete, said that he used to see sports as his only avenue to college; but since starting at Upward Bound, he now says sports is his second gateway. He wants to go to college for academics. 
   It was completely unfortunate that the White House targeted the Upward Bound program for budget cuts. In this day and age when we are spending so much money overseas, up to $10 billion in Iraq, they target monies for folks that need to go to college. 
   Mr. Speaker, the College Cost Reduction Act is a momentous and historic step in a new direction, the right direction for higher education in America. It opens the door to college to thousands of students where those doors were previously slammed shut.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to throw a lifeline to the hardworking men and women in America by voting to increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. It is no secret that health care costs are rising, along with property insurance, and it takes a lot to pay the rent these days. So, in a country where the average CEO earns more before lunchtime than the average minimum wage worker earns all year, this Congress must take action. 
   The increase in the minimum wage will help women, in particular, who comprise nearly two-thirds of all minimum wage workers. Many serve in the lowest-paying jobs back in our home towns, backbone jobs like child care, food service and cashiers. Many are women of color struggling to make ends meet for $5.15 an hour. 
   In my district, according to the United Way of Tampa Bay, over 40 percent of the residents live in poverty. Well, we are going to lift them up. We are going to lift up millions of children by raising the minimum wage. American workers are long overdue for a raise because past Congresses have not increased the minimum wage in 10 years. But we are headed in a new direction now to improve the economic security for hardworking Americans. Step number one, raising the minimum wage.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5, COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the gentlewoman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to act to cut student loan interest rates in half and thereby ease the financial burden of college tuition. Cutting interest rates is more than a cost-saving measure for parents and students, it is also the best means of ensuring access to higher education and, ultimately, a successful career. 
   This Democratic Congress is committed to making college more affordable for all. As a mother with two school-age daughters, I, like many parents across the country, look apprehensively at the cost of tuition today. Tuition costs have skyrocketed. The average tuition at a 4-year public college is almost $6,000, which is a 35 percent increase over the past 5 years. Today's college students typically incur over $17,000 in loan debt, which is a 45 percent increase over the past 11 years. 
   Now, last year, when the Republican Congress made it harder for families to afford college by refusing to increase Pell Grants and proposing a $12.7 billion in Federal student loans, I brought students from the University of Tampa and the University of South Florida together to speak out against the antistudent policies. 
   German Castro, an economics major at the University of Tampa, was worried he would not be able to complete his education without student loans. After all, the annual tuition at the University of Tampa is $18,000, not including room and board. He is working two jobs. He noted many students who have to work full-time jobs end up making bad grades, and bad grades result in loss of scholarship money and, eventually, students have to drop out. 
   For Jill Mitchell, at the University of South Florida, she would prefer not to have to move back in with her parents and take a job while she is concentrating on her studies. 
   This isn't merely about financial solutions, it is also about putting our students in a position to succeed. 
   Now, during the first 100 hours of this new Congress, we are here to change the priorities, to reflect the real desires of Americans. In some of our working-class neighborhoods, student loans are the only means available to pay for the dream of a higher education. 
   The health of our economy rests on having a highly skilled and well-educated workforce. By the year 2020, the United States is projected to face a shortage of up to 12 million college educated workers. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, today I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support students by encouraging their efforts to seek higher education. I ask that we pass H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. This legislation will go a long way to provide relief to the 5.5 million graduates, making college education far more accessible for families. 
   Let us act to remind the families back home that we value education and we are willing to fight to ensure access to it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, the Medicare open enrollment period begins tomorrow, November 15, and runs through the end of the year. Across the country, private HMOs have placed large newspaper ads and are running TV ads to convince seniors to sign up for their private Medicare insurance. 
   I am here to advise seniors to be very cautious. These private HMO insurance salesmen are on the streets and are oftentimes luring our seniors into private Medicare coverage that they do not need. If they leave traditional Medicare and sign up for a private HMO, oftentimes they will lose access to their doctor. 
   Be very cautious. Sons and daughters, grandkids across America, help your parents and grandparents sort through this myriad of options under private Medicare. In Florida, you can seek independent advice from the Department of Elder Affairs and the SHINE Volunteers. Seek independent advice and be very cautious with these private Medicare options.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 813 provides for consideration of the conference report for H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. This is the standard rule for a conference report. It waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration. It also provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   Madam Speaker, for over 40 years Head Start has served as the premier educational and developmental program for America's children, more than 20 million American children and their families. Head Start works. Head Start works because it is a well-researched, comprehensive initiative that combines all of the children's educational needs, their health care needs, and it requires parental involvement. Years later, after four decades of Head Start, the research shows that children that participate in Head Start are  more likely to graduate from high school than their peers. 
   Head Start is a comprehensive approach to child health nutrition and learning, and it is one of our best tools in the struggle to close the achievement gap. The achievement gap for children in poverty in America must be tackled, and Head Start tackles the achievement gap through cognitive social and emotional child development, each of which is a key contributor to entering elementary school ready to succeed. 
   Today, 20 percent of America's 12 million children under the age of 6 unfortunately live in poverty. We know that a family's income level greatly affects their child's access to educational opportunities. The reality of poverty for so many American children in poverty is tied to their low success rates in schools. 
   But in America, family income simply should not impede a child's educational opportunities, and this is where Head Start comes in to level the playing field. Back home in Florida in my community in the Tampa Bay area, over 5,300 children are served by Head Start. But we've got thousands of children that are eligible and are on the waiting list. Why are they on the waiting list? Because previous Congresses have failed to properly support our Head Start kids, and this White House has flat-lined budgets over the years; so our kids merely have been treading water.     
   There have been no improvements or increases in funding since 2003. And with inflation, it has been very difficult to maintain the well-known, high-quality elements in Head Start. But the good news is that this Congress will change that today and make the smartest investment in our country's future workforce. And the research statistics bear repeating; children that participate in Head Start are more likely to graduate from high school. 
   We're going to put more children on a path to success today when we pass this bill and this rule. We're going to improve teacher and classroom quality. We're going to strengthen the focus on school readiness. We're going to expand access so children that are on the waiting list can enter Head Start classrooms. We're going to strengthen those all-important comprehensive services of health care and nutrition. We're going to increase the number of children in early Head Start because the research also shows that it is critical for child brain development that they have interaction by the age of 3, when their brains are developing. We're going to focus on allowing more homeless children to enroll and do a better job for children who are just learning English. 
   This year marks four decades of success for this holistic wraparound initiative that empowers all of us. These children are eager and ready to learn if we give them the tools. 
   The administration's slow-motion cuts to Head Start will now be reversed because this Congress, in a bipartisan way, but led by Democrats, is committed to raising strong and healthy children, and Head Start prepares our children to succeed in school and in life. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I always enjoy hearing the ranking member from the Rules Committee, because 1 year ago, the American people demanded a new direction, to make America safer, to help restore the American Dream, to restore accountability and fiscal responsibility to the people's government. This 110th Congress has brought new faces, new energy and a steadfast commitment to a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I am happy to debate the record of this Congress under Democratic leadership. The Congress is focused on a new direction, first, to make America safer. We have already taken action to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations to protect America from terrorism. This Congress has passed the largest veterans health care funding increase in the history of the VA. We have adopted energy security legislation that will reduce the threat of global climate change. We continue to hold the White House accountable for this unending war in Iraq. 
   In addition, this Congress is restoring the American Dream because now the law of the land is the largest college age expansion since the GI Bill in 1944, where we raised the Pell Grant and we cut the interest rate on student loans. It has been this Congress, and this is important if you are keeping track of the record of this Congress, it was this Congress that raised the minimum wage for millions of Americans. We have also adopted an innovation agenda promoting 21st century jobs in a global economy. We have sent aid to the gulf coast for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and for the millions of Americans that continue to struggle day to day with the impact of those disasters. And we are fighting for health care, to expand health care to 10 million more American children. 
   Madam Speaker, we have also adopted a widely acclaimed and landmark lobby and ethics reform bill. And it has been this Congress that has returned to financial sanity and fiscal responsibility by adhering to pay-as-you-go discipline, no new deficit spending. 
   So I am very pleased to debate the record of this Congress on the floor of the House. We will work in a bipartisan way to build consensus. More than two-thirds of this legislation has passed in a bipartisan manner. We will strive to find common ground where we can, like here on the Head Start bill. But where we cannot, we will stand our ground, like on the Iraq bill that we will bring later today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, by passing the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 and this rule, we will build on the great success of Head Start for America's hardworking families. I would like to salute the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, George Miller; subcommittee Chair, Dale Kildee; the ranking member, Mr. McKeon; and Congressman Castle from the committee, and all the committee members from Education and Labor for their wonderful work on this Head Start bill. 
   I would also like to thank the parents across America who are struggling to provide all that they can for their children. We are on their side. This Democratic Congress is charting a new direction with wise investments in education and health care for our kids, which are certain to pay dividends in the years to come. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an important day for America because Congress is going to keep the promise that it made four decades ago to children who are born with the same potential but, because of their life circumstances, are in need of a little extra attention, health care, nutrition and the guiding hand of a knowledgeable and talented teacher, which together provides them with a true ``head start.'' I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer, along with my distinguished fellow Floridian, and the new rules chairwoman, Ms. Slaughter, an ethics champion in her own right, this legislation extending the rules of the 109th Congress, with ethics reforms to  follow in the 110th Congress. These rules will serve as a baseline for the rules of the 110th Congress, and then we shall add the needed ethics reforms, fiscal responsibility reforms, and rules on civility. 
   After recent tumultuous events, we can all agree that our neighbors back home expect the highest ethical standards from the Members of Congress, the people's House. This rules package includes some of the very good rules changes made in the 109th Congress, including the end of proxy voting in committees and the emergency power granted to the Speaker to recess the House and convene in another location in the case of a terrorist incident. But our Democratic package goes further, instituting ethics reforms that prohibit Members from accepting gifts from registered lobbyists, restricting Members' travel on corporate airplanes, and offering ethics training to Members and staff. 
   I come to the House from local government; and like many of my reform-minded freshmen colleagues, I championed ethics reform on the local level, particularly in the Tampa Bay area, where it was needed in the inner workings of county government. Well, it is needed here in the Halls of Congress now more than ever. 
   The new rules will include a fair and open process for the Congress: no holding open votes to change the outcome and clear guidelines for the operation of conference committees and final conference committee reports. Provisions for more stringent fiscal responsibility and pay-as-you-go budgeting requirements ultimately will aid our neighbors back home in reducing their own debt load while the Federal Government begins to do its part to ease the financial crunch so many of us feel across the country. 
   The proposed transparency in the earmark process and the additional requirement that Members certify that neither their spouses nor their relatives will have any personal financial interest in an earmark request will show and assure our neighbors back home that Congress is indeed operating in a way that best serves the needs and interests of every American. 
   I am humble and proud to be part of this new historic Congress and am glad to stand in support of the ethics reform package led by Ms. Pelosi for high ethical standards in government.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Floridian very much. And I am proud to stand here with many other new Members who are very reform-minded, and let me assure you we are ready to chart the new direction for America. 
   The election is over, and it is time for us to keep our commitment for honest leadership and open government rules changes. During this first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, all of us in this Congress must work together to pass key measures affecting the everyday lives of all Americans. We will begin by adopting the rules of the 109th Congress. This is the baseline proposal that is before us now. But then we shall continue on, on other proposals to clean up Washington, to sever unethical ties between lawmakers and lobbyists. We will start by banning travel and gifts from lobbyists, requiring full transparency to end the abuse of special interest earmarks, and ending the abusive processes that have undermined democracy in this House. These measures are the first steps to ensure that the Congress upholds the highest ethical standards. 
   Americans have paid the cost of corruption in Washington with skyrocketing prices at the pump, spiraling drug costs, and the waste and fraud of  no bid contracts in the Gulf and Iraq. No more. Reform is a top priority for this House because reform is a top priority for the American people. 
   As our first responsibility in fulfilling the mandate of this critical election, the Democrats are offering an aggressive reform package to restore the public trust. So, let's begin.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Rules Committee Chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Iraq Accountability Act under this rule is the most responsible way to chart a new direction to the Bush-Cheney stay-the-course policy in Iraq, to bring our troops home and to protect our national security. 
   The American people are way beyond the politicians at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Nevertheless, our government is at a crossroads. On the one hand, some want to continue to endorse the Bush-Cheney war without end, a war that the administration sought because they were blinded by the prospects of oil profits. They want to continue a blank-check, rubber-stamp, diplomatically impotent position. 
   On the other hand, I urge my colleagues to patriotically stand up for a greater Nation, be strategically smarter and support our brave men and women in uniform. That is the responsible course of action. 
   Ensuring that our troops in the field have all of the resources they require is the responsible thing to do. Focusing again in a meaningful way on al Qaeda and the Taliban is the responsible thing to do. Improving health care for injured soldiers and veterans is the responsible thing to do. And oversight of the misspending and waste by the executive branch is the responsible thing to do. 
   Requiring the Iraqi Government to provide for its own defense is the right and responsible thing to do, so that we can take our brave men and women in uniform out of the middle of the Iraqi civil war and bring our troops home. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am particularly concerned that the reckless Bush escalation will continue to undermine our country's readiness and ability to address other threats to our national security. Indeed, in recent testimony before our committee, the Army Chief of Staff testified that America will run a strategic risk by implementing the escalation and staying on the same course in Iraq. 
   The American people are demanding a new direction from the White House. This includes one of my neighbors in Tampa, Armando B. Arias.  
   Mr. Arias would meet anyone's definition of ``patriot.'' He loves his country and has served in two separate wars--World War II and Korea. When I asked him a few months back when I knocked on his door in West Tampa what he most wanted his new Congresswoman to work on, he replied immediately, ``get out of the war and ring our kids home.'' 
   I am proud to be here today to keep that commitment to Armando Arias and Americans everywhere who are demanding fundamental change. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and the Iraq Accountability Act.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, here on Black History Month, I'm very pleased to salute Essie Mae Reed from Tampa, Florida, a true community hero. Essie Mae Reed has been an outspoken voice for the poor and struggling families in Tampa for decades. As a resident of the Central Park Village housing project in 1967, she created the first tenants association and ultimately advocated on behalf of thousands of families in Tampa. 
   Essie Mae Reed established the Boys and Girls Club. She ensured children could go to the community college for enrichment programs. She publicized unsanitary conditions. She ensured children will receive lunch in schools. She fought to have hot water heaters installed in public housing. She forced a change in public housing policy that barred single mother s from public housing. 
   Essie Mae Reed was the first African American woman to run for the Tampa City Council; and when they charged her a substantial qualifying fee, she challenged it, and the Federal district court threw it out and ruled it unconstitutional. 
   Essie Mae Reed is a Tampa and American treasure. She stood up for so many that didn't have a voice and improved lives throughout our community.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the terrorism subcommittee, Mr. Smith. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the commitment, dedication and sacrifice of the men, women and extended family of Special Operations Command. Special Operations Command is located in Tampa, Florida, at MacDill Air Force Base in my district, and I am very proud to use this week, the 20th anniversary of the command's founding, to salute their service. 
   There is little doubt that a need still exists for the well-coordinated special forces.     
   There are just some things that conventional forces are not set up to do. Special forces have been around for centuries. But SOCOM can directly trace its roots to the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, the intelligence agency that was formed during World War II. 
   Tampa resident Art Frizzell, who is 87, served as an OSS agent. He parachuted behind German lines in France and worked with French partisans to blow up bridges and help organize the resistance during World War II. 
   In many ways, Frizzell said, special operations were as much about brains and unconventional warfare in the 1940s as they are today. We recognized, Frizzell said, that we had to be flexible. We did the job that nobody else could do. 
   So at this 20th anniversary, we salute the brave men and women who have served our country in the special operations, much of which you will never understand or know. But the American people trust in their service. 
   So on this day, on behalf of the Florida's 11th District, proud home of Special Operations Command, we salute your service and thank you.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the RECOVER Act and this rule which charts a new direction for emergency and hurricane planning, because the Federal Government simply must be ready to respond in a crisis. 
   Small Business Committee Chair Nydia Vel&#225;zquez and her committee deserve credit for understanding the expectations of the American people, who have insisted upon better disaster relief planning. 
   My colleagues from Florida, and indeed, our neighbors and citizens across the gulf coast, begin to feel a bit apprehensive this time of year because hurricane season is only a few weeks away. Yes, we are all worried about the potential landfall of a hurricane, but we are also just as concerned about the administration's ability to deal with the aftermath.  
   Following the Bush administration's poor response to the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes, the new Congress has pledged to strengthen disaster planning and response, and we are following through here today. The RECOVER Act will improve the Small Business Administration's disaster response plans and assess its technology, telecommunications and personnel in advance. 
   In the event of another hurricane or natural disaster, small business owners will face costs of starting up again, so this act increases the funds available for disaster loans from $1.5 to $3 million. And importantly for the hardworking folks like those in my district in the Tampa Bay area, small business owners will no longer be required to pledge their homes as collateral for business loans less than $100,000. 
   The act also requires the SBA to improve coordination with State and local authorities and establishes a disaster relief corps of 1,000 trained individuals. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge approval of this rule and the RECOVER Act so that our country is better prepared for hurricane season and the swift recovery of our communities and small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my distinguished colleague from the Rules Committee for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1257 to provide a reality check to the skyrocketing compensation of CEOs of corporations across America. From 1995 to 2005, average CEO pay increased five times faster than that of the average worker. The American people understand the growing disparities in earnings in our country. The average CEO makes more money before lunch than the average worker earns all year. So today I urge my colleagues to bring a measure of accountability to the boardroom by allowing shareholders to voice their opinions in a meaningful way about the multimillion-dollar paydays of their CEOs. 
   Last week, one of my hometown newspapers, the St. Petersburg Times, reported on ``Corporate Paydays That Boggle the Mind.'' They reported that in one of the richest corporate paydays ever, the CEO of oil company Occidental Petroleum Corporation received a total compensation package last year of $416 million. These record profits and paydays at a time when my neighbors and the American people are paying record prices at the gas pump highlights the need for a new direction in this country for energy policy. 
   Similarly, record profits and paydays at HMO and pharmaceutical companies raise red flags at a time when patients and doctors and hospitals have lost control to many of the Bush privatization schemes in our health care system. The new Democratic Congress passed legislation fortunately during the first 100 hours to require the negotiation of the Medicare part D drug price benefit. This is very important. It's un-American to block the negotiation of fair prices under Medicare part D. 
   What I hear from my seniors back home is that they want Medicare part D to be simpler so that it works for them, so that it works for our seniors and it works for our taxpayers and not simply benefit the HMOs, the big drug companies and their CEOs for these large corporate paydays. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this rule and this bill to allow shareholders to send a message about corporate paydays that boggle the mind and bring a measure of accountability to our American boardrooms.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 594 provides for consideration of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007. 
   The rule provides 2 hours of general debate in the House, with 1 hour controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means and 1 hour controlled by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order the Ways and Means Committee substitute, modified by an amendment printed in the Rules Committee report. That amendment reflects a compromise between the committees of jurisdiction. The rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, in our great country today, the wealthiest country in the world, parents still struggle to ensure that their children lead healthy lives. 
   Is there anything more important, after the birth of your child, than visits to the pediatrician and the care of devoted nurses? And as your baby grows, is there anything more fundamental than regular checkups and physicals? 
   Many dedicated doctors and nurses are on call at all hours when, God forbid, something goes wrong or your child is sick. Fortunately, in America today, many hardworking families have regular and affordable health care through the State Children's Health Insurance Program, what we called SCHIP; and today the Congress will vote to extend and improve children's health insurance for another 5 years. 
   Regular, accessible and affordable health care puts children on a path to success in life. A healthy child is a healthy student. A healthy child means more productive parents who do not miss work. Healthy students become productive adults. They succeed in life and eventually make America stronger. 
   Every parent and grandparent in America today understands the importance of our debate and our fight to ensure that children can see a doctor or a nurse and have access to affordable health care. 
   Despite all that we understand about the importance of healthy kids and early preventative care, health insurance and those all-important visits to the doctor are all too expensive and out of reach for over 11 million children in America.     
   Uninsured children are five times less likely than insured kids to have a primary care doctor or to have visited a doctor or a dentist in the past 2 years. This lack of access in medical attention harms that child, the family, the community back home and ultimately this great country. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to stand up and fight for these families and America's children by passing this rule and supporting the House Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization bill, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, or the CHAMP Act. 
   I am proud to say that the precursor to SCHIP originated in the 1990s as a novel plan by State leaders in my home State of Florida. These innovators understood the link between healthy kids and success in school. They helped parents with direct information on access to affordable health care for their kids. 
   President Clinton and the Congress were so impressed by what the State of Florida was doing for children's health care that they took the Florida KidCare blueprint and fashioned a national program. It has enjoyed national success and bipartisan support ever since. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Governors in this country support the reauthorization of SCHIP. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a letter of support from Republican Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist.

   And, Madam Speaker, I hope the American people know there are many champions for America's kids standing up for our hardworking families in the Nation's Capitol today; and we are joining with Republican and Democratic Governors from across the country fighting for a new direction, for a healthier and economically sound America. 
   It was only 8 months ago when Speaker  Nancy Pelosi accepted the gavel as the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. She accepted that gavel on behalf of America's children, and we're going to keep our promise to America's kids today. 
   There's another champion in the Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. LOUISE SLAUGHTER, who has helped us fight through these delaying tactics to bring this bill to the floor, and we will vote on it today. 
   In the Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman JOHN DINGELL continues to be a voice of clarity and advocacy for America's children; and he is joined by the voices, the loud voices, of Congressman Frank Pallone and Congresswoman DIANA DEGETTE and the members of that committee. 
   In the Ways and Means Committee, where PAYGO means something now in this new Congress, Chairman CHARLIE RANGEL has led our effort to pay for this Act. 
   And I salute the subcommittee Chair, Mr. PETE STARK, and the members of that committee and many, many more on the floor of this House, who are not just Members of Congress, but we are also parents and we are grandparents. 
   The real champions, however, are the parents across America working to make ends meet and provide their children with a healthy and successful life. We are on their side today and every day, even in the face of resistance from the White House, where the President suggests that the health care for America's kids can be found in the emergency rooms of local hospitals. That is wrong. 
   Instead, through the SCHIP program and children's health care and this innovative partnership between communities, States and Federal Government, we will make important investments in our kids and their health today that will pay dividends down the road for our economy. It will reduce the strain on our emergency rooms, our crowded local emergency rooms, and it will reduce the strain on moms and dads. 
   This is, indeed, a historic day, a day for a new direction, a day full of hope for the health of our children and a better America. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my distinguished colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. In doing so, I join with the majority of Americans and law enforcement agencies who understand that violent acts fueled by bigotry and hatred of a particular group simply because of who they are has no place in America. 
   H.R. 1592, and this rule, strengthens and broadens protections for our neighbors for attacks based on disability, gender, and sexual orientation. This bill provides local law enforcement with tools needed to partner with our Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute these hateful acts. 
   Why is it needed? Well, unfortunately, in my area of Florida, bigoted crimes are on the rise. This week police arrested and charged two Pinellas County teenagers after they spray-painted anti-Semitic and racial slurs on nine portable classrooms at a local high school. 
   Last month, a Polk County man was stabbed to death for being gay. 
   Also last month, the Islamic Education Center of Florida in Tampa was set on fire, and thousands of my neighbors were left without a place to hold religious services. 
   Last year, two men in neighboring Polk County were jailed on hate crime charges after they threw beer bottles at a club owner in Tampa, who happened to be speaking Arabic, and threatened to kill him. 
   According to my local State attorney general's offices, 334 hate crimes were reported in Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties in 2004, up from 275 in 2003. Fifty-two of those hate crimes were motivated by sexual orientation in 2004. 
   Nationwide, victims of hate crimes have reported an average of 191,000 hate crime incidents since the year 2000. 
   This bill says that we as Americans do not stand for violent acts upon our neighbors based upon who they are; we will not tolerate terrorism against any group of people; and we will provide our local law enforcement agencies with the tools needed to prosecute you when you use violence to spread fear and hate. 
   Members, I urge you to pass this important bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 348 provides for consideration of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. The rules waive all points of order against the bill except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for 12 amendments, all contained in the committee report. 
   Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 years Head Start has served as the premier educational and developmental program for more than 20 million American children and families. Head Start works. It works because it is a well-researched, comprehensive initiative that combines children's educational needs with health care and parent outreach. 
   This comprehensive approach to child health, nutrition and learning is one of our best tools to tackle the achievement gap in education for children living in poverty across our Nation. 
   The achievement gap begins far before children enter elementary school. Head Start tackles the achievement gap through cognitive, social and emotional child development, each of which is a key contributor to entering elementary school prepared to succeed. 
   Today 20 percent of America's 12 million children under age 6 live in poverty. We know that a family's income level greatly affects their children's access to educational opportunities. The reality of poverty for so many children, unfortunately, is tied to low success rates in our classrooms. This is true in my home State of Florida. In my community in the Tampa Bay area, over 5,300 children currently are served by Head Start, but many thousands more are on waiting lists and are eligible. 
   They are on waiting lists because for so many years previous Congresses have failed to reenact Head Start, and the White House has proposed flat-line budgets, so our kids merely have been treading water. With no improvements or increases in funding since 2003, and inflation going up, it has become more difficult to maintain the well-known, high-quality elements in Head Start. 
   The good news is that this new Congress will change that today and make the smartest investment for our country's future workforce. We are going to put more kids on the path to success when we pass this bill and rule today. 
   This bill will improve teacher and classroom quality, strengthen the focus on school readiness, expand access to thousands more children across America, strengthen comprehensive services, increase the number of children in early Head Start, because we are a lot smarter these days based upon the research that has been done on early child development and the development of the brain. We are going to allow homeless children to enroll, and we are going to do a better job, my colleague from Florida, for children who are just learning English. 
   On Monday, I paid a visit to the West Tampa Head Start Center and delivered books to the kids and teachers to mark the four decades of smashing success of this holistic, wraparound initiative that empowers all of us. These children are eager and ready to learn if we give them the tools. 
   We need to raise strong and healthy children. Head Start prepares children to succeed in school and in life. The administration's slow-motion cuts of Head Start over past years will now be reversed. The American people stood up in November and asked for change, and today we are going to stand up for them.     
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I anticipate on the floor of the House today we will hear some debate over the role of faith-based organizations in Head Start. Republicans would like language that would repeal existing civil rights protections in this Head Start law that ensure the program's Federal funds discriminate, and we are opposed to that. 
   No citizen should have to pass a religious test to qualify for a publicly  funded job. That is exactly what some on the other side of the aisle will attempt to do today. 
   Religious organizations who run Head Start programs are not asking for this change. They have written us to oppose it. Head Start teachers and staff should be chosen because they are qualified and they are effective teachers who will help children succeed and thrive. Hiring and firing decisions should not be made because of a teacher's religion. 
   This is part of an ongoing attempt, I am afraid, by some on the other side of the aisle to make religion a wedge issue. 
   Democrats strongly support faith-based organizations running Head Start programs, and H.R. 1429 on the floor today specifically reaffirms that faith-based organizations may run Head Start programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), my colleague from the Rules Committee.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 and this rule so that we infuse Head Start with the necessary investments and program enhancements that will sustain Head Start for years to come. We will chart a new course in the right direction by ensuring family incomes do not impede a child's access to educational opportunities. 
   The fact that the administration and the past few Congresses did not keep the promise to America's children is unfortunate. We have lost ground. But the good news is that this new Democratic Congress is charting a new direction. This includes wise investments in the education and health of our kids, which are certain to pay dividends for years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important day for America. The Congress is going to keep the promise made 4 decades ago to children who are born with the same potential but, because of their life circumstances, are in need of a little extra attention, health care, nutrition, the guiding hand of a knowledgeable, talented, devoted teacher, and a true head start. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH MONTH -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, Mrs. Capps from California, for yielding the time, and thank her for her ongoing efforts and advocacy on behalf of the health of America's children and all Americans all across this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 760, supporting the goals and ideals of Children's Health Month. As cochair of the Congressional Children's Health Care Caucus, I am pleased to offer this resolution along with my colleague from the other side of the aisle, Mr. Reichert of Washington, who is the cochair of the caucus. 
   This has been an important year for work on children's health issues. As grandparents and parents and teachers and doctors and nurses and all community members understand, our work on behalf of children's health is constant, notwithstanding the fact that we are going to recognize a certain month here today. 
   We are working on behalf of children's health in so many collaborative ways, and we want to encourage more. We are encouraging families and schools to focus on healthy living habits and healthy nutrition for children. We are working to combat childhood obesity and to promote exercise and physical activity. We are continuing our concerted efforts to keep our children and teens from smoking. We are working to educate families and raise medical awareness about critical childhood illnesses such as asthma and diabetes. And, so many across this country are working to help parents and other families sign their kids up for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and those activities must continue. 
   But our concerns are not limited only to the physical health of our children, but also to their mental health and their behavioral health. I note just today that two new studies were released relating to early childhood behavior. We have got to remain at the cutting edge, and we have got to continue to encourage our talented researchers in my home State in Florida, Mrs. Capps' State of California, and all across the country to continue their work. 
   In addition, all too often our children are victims of abuse and neglect and do not receive the special care required to meet their health care needs and their mental health care needs. Here in the Congress, we are working to ensure that these disparities are eliminated and that our children receive all the support that they need. We would like our neighbors back home to know that we care about their families and the well-being of their children, and we will continue to draw attention to these issues and work hard to amend these problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, today as we acknowledge Children's Health Month and the importance of its meaning, we remind our neighbors and this body of the special attention needed for children's health. We salute the parents, pediatricians, nurses, and all community members that work every day to care for our kids, for their physical and mental well-being. We commend those institutions that have honored the goals of this special month, and we acknowledge the importance of supporting America's children by reinforcing our sincere dedication to providing access to health care for our kids, ensuring preventative care, seeking cures for debilitating diseases and chronic conditions, and promoting healthy lifestyles for America's children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 580 and ask for its immediate consideration. 
   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows 
   H. Res. 580 
    Resolved,  That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 986) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources now printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions of the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.
    Sec. 2. During consideration of H.R. 986 pursuant to this resolution, notwithstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to such time as may be designated by the Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 580 will allow the House to consider H.R. 986, the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act. 
   Additionally, this rule makes a technical correction in the underlying bill by replacing a letter ``a'' with a letter ``b'' in the legislative text. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate in the House equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act, H.R. 986, was considered under suspension of the rules on  July 11, and received 239 votes, a majority of the House Members voting in favor of the bill. But as you know, Mr. Speaker, two-thirds majority is required for the expedited suspension procedure; and because the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act was supported by well over half the Members of the House, H.R. 986 deserves another opportunity for a floor vote. Therefore, today I urge a favorable vote again for H.R. 986. 
   Mr. Speaker, with over 150 miles of pristine rivers and streams and 62 square miles of relatively undeveloped countryside in the Connecticut area, the Eightmile Wild River watershed is an exceptional natural and cultural resource. This is being championed by House Member Joe Courtney, a new freshman colleague of mine from Connecticut. 
   The watershed contains large areas of unfragmented habitat, an array of rare and diverse wildlife, scenic vistas, high water quality, unimpeded stream flow, and significant cultural features. The Eightmile watershed has historic stone walls, churches and homes, and scenic views throughout, and an abundance of rare and diverse species within the watershed, including 155 at-risk plant and animal species.     
   The overall Eightmile River watershed ecosystem is healthy and intact throughout virtually all of its range. The Eightmile River is an exceptional treasure because it is a rare example of an intact river system. This is especially noteworthy in such a highly populated area so close to the coast and within the New York-to-Boston corridor. We must do all that we can to preserve this exceptional natural and cultural resource. The National Park Service agreed in 2006 in its study of the area. 
   And again, I'd really like to salute my freshman colleague, new Congressman Joe Courtney. He has championed this effort to designate segments of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   Communities in the area have been working for over 10 years for this designation, so I congratulate them today and salute the leadership of Congressman Joe Courtney, who brought new energy and commitment to this effort. 
   I also thank Natural Resources Committee Chair Nick Rahall for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontroversial bill. It was reported favorably by the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote in May. It received the strong bipartisan support of the House with a majority vote on July 11. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and support the act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to return the debate to the matter on the floor. 
   The Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act sponsored by my colleague, Congressman JOE COURTNEY of Connecticut, which designates certain segments of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   Mr. Speaker, how fortunate we are to live in such a beautiful country; spacious skies, amber waves of grain, purple mountain's majesty, and the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River corridor. 
   Despite the protestations from the other side of the aisle, it has been the communities and the residents of this area that have worked on this designation for 10 years or more. And so I congratulate them today. And I salute the leadership of Congressman JOE COURTNEY, who brought a new energy and commitment to this effort, and I thank Natural Resources Committee Chair NICK RAHALL for his leadership. 
   This is a noncontroversial bill. It was reported favorably by the Natural Resources Committee by a voice vote in May. It received the strong bipartisan support of the House, over 235 Members on July 11. Mr. Speaker, the Eightmile River is a national treasure, and we must do all that we can to preserve it. 
   This bill enjoys bipartisan support. A majority of the Members of this House have voted for it, and we're going to vote for it again. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the important Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, and I would like to thank the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Chairwoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER, for her leadership, for her perseverance in moving this critical legislation. She has been fighting for the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act for over 13 years. So we will herald her leadership today on behalf of American families and all hardworking folks across this country. 
   I am fortunate to serve on the Committee on Rules under her leadership. The folks across this country should be very proud that we have such a dedicated chairwoman leading the committee in the people's House. I'd also like to salute Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT for her participation and perseverance as well in moving this legislation and fighting for it for so many years. 
   Madam Speaker, this New Direction Congress already has done a great deal to strengthen antidiscrimination efforts for our Nation this year, such as legislation that outlaws inequities in medical coverage for mental health care. Today, we will end another form of discrimination in the workplace and by health insurance companies. 
   The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act protects our neighbors from being denied health coverage or being hired or keeping a job based upon their God-given personal genetic traits. In my district in Tampa, Florida, the University of South Florida Regional Genetics Program has been doing great work in genetics research. Now they can do so much more. People will be more willing to participate in genetics research. The testing, the genetic counseling for families with genetic conditions, now they will not be so afraid and hiding because they fear they would be discriminated against if someone learned that they might have an inclination for breast cancer or diabetes or some other disease. 
   The scientific research opportunities are endless, and under this bill people will be protected and employers will not be able to request or purchase genetic information about employees or their families. Any information found indirectly may not be used against an employee or disclosed. Further, this legislation would outlaw health insurance companies' ability to cancel, deny, or change the terms of individual plans based upon their genetic background. 
   This is a civil rights issue and a privacy issue, and this legislation is an absolute necessity to provide protection for Americans in the workplace and within their health coverage. The cost of health care in America is burdensome enough without an added concern that coverage may be unethically jeopardized based on genetic information. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill and again salute the leadership of Chairwoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER and Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the landmark Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008, and this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are fighting for fundamental change in our Nation's energy policy. For too long, the big oil companies have had a stranglehold over politicians in Washington, DC and over our country's energy policy. 
   All we have to do is examine the headlines these days: ``Pain at the Pump Grows.'' Another headline: ``Cost of Gas Hits All-Time High.'' 
   But there is a very interesting juxtaposition of headlines, because the other headlines in our Nation's newspapers read something like this: ``ExxonMobil Profit Sets Record Again.'' That's right, almost $41 billion last year, breaking the record that they had set only last year. 
   This sales figure alone exceeds the gross domestic product of 120 countries. To put this in perspective, ExxonMobil earned more than $1,287 of profit for every second in the year 2007. 
   So here is the question: Do the American people continue to subsidize big oil companies while they are making record profits? Or do we shift our investment to cleaner, renewable fuels? 
   Mr. Speaker, I know the White House does not like this. President Bush said he would veto this, but we are not going to give up. This new Congress, led by Democrats, is responding to folks in every State in America demanding change in our country's energy policy. 
   They understand that this is vital to our national security, and it's vital to  their pocketbooks. The contrast between the politics of the past, represented by the White House, and our forward-looking bill could not be clearer. 
   Remember just 7 years ago, the administration's energy task force met behind closed doors. It consisted of oil company executives, and the administration fought to keep everything secret. Renewable sources of energy were not a priority. The Earth's climate change was not a priority. And the recommendations involved more drilling, more mining and more of the same, which led only to record gas prices for families, record profits for oil companies and disastrous national security consequences. I mean, after all, under the current administration, gas prices have doubled. 
   In contrast, our groundbreaking efforts to date are setting our country on a path towards energy independence. Despite the fact that the White House continues to side with Big Oil and threaten a veto of this bill, we are not going to give up. 
   We already have a great record. We have strengthened national security by increasing fuel efficiency standards. We have raised the fuel economy standards. We have lowered energy costs by focusing on conservation and efficiency. We have tackled global climate change, but we are only just beginning to set the new course on the Nation's energy policy. 
   By repealing subsidies to the big oil companies and investing in the renewable energy technologies, we will continue to march towards new energy solutions. The status quo in Washington is not acceptable anymore. The White House might threaten veto, but we are not going to give up.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 720 provides for consideration of H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007. 
   As the Clerk read, the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order the Financial Services reported substitute. The rule makes in order eight amendments, including a complete Republican substitute. The amendments are each debatable for 10 minutes, except for the Neugebauer substitute, which is debatable for 20 minutes. The amendments are not amendable or divisible. 
   All points of order are waived against the amendments, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, so many American families today are facing a critical housing crunch. The cost of an apartment or a home is out of reach for so many, but there is good news. Many of us in this Congress understand and will keep fighting for a new direction for America and more affordable housing. 
   Today we will create a landmark affordable housing trust fund under H.R. 2895 in this rule, which will provide over 1.5 million new affordable homes for hard-working folks across America over the next decade. I would like to thank Chairman Barney Frank and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for their dedication to American families in their efforts to make housing affordable and available to those who could use a helping hand. 
   They pledged at the beginning of this new Congress that they would focus on affordable housing, and they have stayed true to their word. 
   Four other bills in addition to this one that will be considered today expand American homeownership and provide relief to our neighbors, many of whom have been subjected to foreclosure due to predatory lending in the subprime loan crisis.  
   This new affordable housing trust fund will focus on construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing in our hometowns and communities across America. The trust fund will pool monies, together with State, local and private housing initiatives to target housing to families with the greatest economic need. 
   The innovative, dedicated funding mechanism for this new trust fund comes at no new cost to taxpayers. Our efforts come at a critical time. Federal money for affordable housing has largely disappeared under this current administration. Health care costs are out of sight, the cost of living is higher, and many of our neighbors have not received raises that keep up with these rising costs. 
   We have heard from so many Americans across this country. For example, in south St. Petersburg, just recently, I was talking with a police officer that works for the City of St. Petersburg. He said it was his dream to have his young son move into his neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately, affordable housing in that neighborhood is all but gone, and he will just not be able to swing it. 
   In addition, local housing agencies across America have thousands upon thousands of Americans on waiting lists for affordable housing. In my hometown of Tampa, Florida, during a 1-week open enrollment session, more than 10,000 seniors, families and veterans indicated a need for affordable housing. But there is just no inventory. 
   Instead of receiving housing, they are placed on a waiting list. That waiting list takes 4 years, and it makes affordable housing completely unreachable for the other people that simply never made that call for help. 
   The number of American households paying more than half of their incomes on housing increased to 17 million in the year 2005, with one in seven U.S. households being severely housing-cost burdened. This imbalance is very troubling, and when combined with predatory subprime loans, it has caused many homeowners to lose their homes. In the Tampa Bay area alone, in the first 6 months of this year, over 10,000 of my neighbors have found that their homes have fallen into foreclosure. 
   This new affordable housing trust fund will provide for the new construction, preservation of existing housing and homeownership, assistance, emergency housing repairs and housing-related services. Help is on the way. 
   H.R. 2895 is a positive step in a new direction to ensure that more families are able to find clean, safe, stable and affordable places to live. I am proud to support this bill and this rule, and I urge the Congress to pass this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1384 provides an open rule with a preprinting requirement. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule waives points of order against provisions of the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   The rule provides that any amendment to the bill must be printed in the Congressional Record by July 30. Each amendment so printed may be offered only by the Member who caused it to be printed or his designee and shall be considered as read. 
   The rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Finally, the rule provides that the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to a time designated by the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to stand with my colleagues in support of H.R. 6599, the 2009 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act and this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, the New Direction Congress has made the lives of America's veterans one of our top priorities. Years from now, history will reflect that it was this Democratically led 110th Congress, in the middle of two wars, that renewed the country's commitment to veterans and their health. 
   Our commitment simply is a reflection of the pride and appreciation the American people have for the service of their brave men and women in uniform, who have served so greatly in recent conflicts and wars.     
   Now, just weeks ago, after months of perseverance in the face of opposition from the White House, this Congress, in a bipartisan way, adopted the new 21st century GI Bill that provides a full 4-year college tuition to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The new GI Bill for our veterans was adopted by a vote here in the House of 256-156. 
   Last year, we adopted the largest reform and investment in veterans' health care in the history of the Veterans Administration. And just yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the Congress adopted additional reforms to the Veterans Administration process that will improve the lives of veterans across this country. 
   Congressman Cazayoux from Louisiana brought H.R. 6445, that prohibits the collection by the Department of Veterans Affairs of copayments or other fees for hospital or nursing home care when they are catastrophically disabled. 
   Congressman Paul Hodes of New Hampshire also brought H.R. 2192, that establishes in the Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of the Ombudsman to act as a liaison to veterans and their families with respect to VA health care and their benefits. 
   I also salute my colleague, Congressman John Hall of New York. We adopted his bill yesterday, H.R. 5892, the Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act, that directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to modernize the disability benefits claims processing system to ensure that our veterans are served in a timely and accurate way. 
   Now, in this appropriations bill that is before the House today, the American people, through the actions of this Congress, will provide the necessary resources for veterans and facilities and the infrastructure for the Armed Forces. This includes training facilities, housing, and equipment for our troops in their ongoing fight to defend our great Nation here and overseas. 
   While our brave servicemembers are overseas, most military families remain at home on bases, and we are committed to an excellent standard of living for them and quality of life. That includes convenient child care, and a safe and affordable place to live. I know this because I have conversations with the men and women who serve on the MacDill Air Force Base in my hometown of Tampa, Florida. They tell me that they feel much more safe and secure knowing that their families are well taken care of and well served back home on the base. 
   So Members should be proud that we have gone above and beyond the White House's initial budget offering. We provide nearly $4 billion more than the President in additional resources, particularly for our veterans health care programs. 
   Just last week, a panel testified before the Congress that returning soldiers still are not receiving the health care they deserve at Walter Reed and across the country, and this is unacceptable. And that is why in this appropriations bill we fund the VA health care system to try to get it back on track because we've asked everything of these great men and women, the ultimate sacrifice, and the least we can do as their government is support them when they return and ensure that they have the health care they need. When our troops go off to fight valiantly for our country, we're going to ensure that they have the best health care when they return. 
   Now, the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Oftentimes, these injuries will require a lifetime of continuing medical care. In fact, the Veterans Health Administration estimates that just next year, in 2009, they will treat more than 5.8 million patients. I'm very fortunate, Mr. Speaker, that in my hometown of Tampa, we have an outstanding VA hospital, the James Haley VA Center. It is known as the busiest VA hospital in the country. We are also fortunate to have one of only four polytrauma units there that serve the most critically wounded veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   So I've seen directly how oftentimes medical staff is overworked, they don't have the facilities that they need. That's why we provide above and beyond the President's request and reject his $38 million cut for medical and prosthetic research. We will continue to invest in medical military construction to improve the aging and outdated medical treatment facilities so they have access to the best medical care. 
   Now, to help the VA get a head start on helping those hundreds of thousands of new patients in the VA system, we're going to ask that they bring on additional VA claims processors because there is a terrible backlog in this country, and that's the last thing that our veterans should have to face after their service. Currently, in my State, there are over 25,000 pending cases, and nearly 19 percent of those have been in a holding pattern for over 180 days. We can and we must do better for our veterans. 
   We also oppose, through this appropriations bill, the Bush administration's squeeze on veterans' wallets. The Bush administration has proposed increases in enrollment fees and doubling of prescription drug copayments. How sensible is it to add to the already large number of uninsured in America by making it harder for those who have sacrificed in service to this Nation to get the care they need? Well, this New Direction Congress can and will do better for our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly applaud the leadership of Chairman Chet Edwards, who held numerous hearings in an open, bipartisan process that gave Members and the many military families and veterans groups an opportunity to review and weigh in, in a thoughtful and responsible way, to ensure that our current and past military troops and their families get the much-needed funding for various programs that they have earned by way of their service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know the American people will appreciate that this is a bipartisan effort for our country's sons and daughters, who put their lives on the line for us every day. We will fulfill our promise to help them lead whole and healthy lives in honor of their sacrifice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And I would like to point out that the Republican member from the Appropriations Committee that came to the Rules Committee did state, and I took notes that afternoon, that Chairman Edwards did a great job. We've had 18 hearings. This has been an open and bipartisan process, a very open process. It has served as a model of bipartisanship.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1338, PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the chairwoman for yielding time and thank her for her career of championing nondiscrimination and equal rights for women in the workplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act and this rule and take another important step towards equality for all Americans. During the 230 plus-year history of our great Nation, the march towards equality under the law for all of our citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady. 
   Over time, the Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion, and disability, because when it comes to employment and hiring and firing and promotion and compensation, decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance. 
   These are the values we share as Americans; that if someone works hard and plays by the rules, and if they share the same job, duties and responsibilities, no matter that they are a man or a woman, they will receive equal pay for equal work. Unfortunately, that does not always happen, and sometimes women are paid less just because they are women and the boss can get away with it. The wage disparity over time can cost women over $400,000 to $2 million in lost wages. 
   This Paycheck Fairness Act addresses that disparity by providing more effective remedies for gender-based wage discrimination and ensuring that if a case goes all the way to a jury, that the arbitrary and outdated caps on damages will be addressed. 
   Thank you to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. She introduced this legislation 11 years ago, but she never gave up. Congresswoman DeLauro, we are not going to give up just because the President has threatened to veto the measure. I'd also like to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, Chairman George Miller, and Chairwoman Louise Slaughter for their leadership and commitment to equality under the law for all Americans. 
   Passing this historic Paycheck Fairness Act will bring our Nation closer to our promise of equality for all Americans. It is a hopeful day for working women and families, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on their behalf.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, the American people will be pleased today that the House of Representatives will move and pass, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, like it was in the Appropriations Committee, a bipartisan bill that provides so much for the servicemen and -women and their families who are being asked to sacrifice so much after many years of war. 
   This bill is a fitting salute and tribute to the men and women who are on the front lines, who are on the battlefield and those in the military and VA hospitals across this country and the outpatient clinics fighting a different kind of war, to help those who return maintain a dignified quality of life for them and their families. 
   We will also assist veterans of wars past and demonstrate our appreciation for their service by ensuring that their claims will be processed in a timely fashion and that they have access to the range of health care options available to them and every American. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ``New Direction'' Congress has pledged to put our troops and veterans first. By restoring GI veterans education benefits, improving veterans health care, rebuilding our military and strengthening other benefits for our troops and military families, we are working to keep our promises to our courageous and faithful men and women in uniform. For too long, officials in Washington have neglected our troops and veterans in a time of war. On the battlefield, the military pledges to leave no soldier behind, and, as a nation, let it be our pledge that when they return home, we leave no veteran behind. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1362, ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 242 provides for consideration of H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 80 minutes of general debate, with 60 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule provides that in lieu of the substitutes recommended by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Armed Services, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part A of the Rules Committee report shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. All points of order except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI are waived against the substitute, and the substitute shall be considered as read. 
   The rule makes in order the two amendments printed in part B of the Rules Committee report. Each amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report and by the Member designated in the report. The amendments are considered as read, are debatable for 10 minutes each, are not subject to amendment and are not divisible. All points of order against the amendments except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI are waived. 
   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, this rule and the legislation before us today is the Accountability in Contracting Act. This new act will restore accountability in Federal contracting. It targets conflicts of interest that have become too prevalent over past years. 
   During the first 100 hours of this new Congress, we charted a new direction in response to the American people's call for change and reform. We passed pay-as-you-go budgeting to require greater fiscal responsibility, we passed Medicare part D reform to require the executive branch to negotiate lower drug prices for our seniors and help the Federal bottom line, and we eliminated unnecessary tax subsidies for big oil companies that were making record profits while we paid record prices at the pump. 
   But if you recall, Madam Speaker, the first item of business during the first 100 hours of this new Congress was ethics reform. After the scandals of the past years, our commitment to the American people is to fight for higher ethical standards in the United States Congress and for all of the Federal Government by severing the connection between lobbyists and legislation, by banning gifts and travel from lobbyists, and ending the abuses of privately funded travel. 
   Today, the new Democratic Congress will continue our fight for ethics reform while we are still in the first 100 days through this rule and the Accountability in Contracting Act. This bill targets waste in Federal contracting, limits the use of no-bid contracts, minimizes sole-source contracts, and closes the revolving door between purchasing officers and private contractors. This bill addresses the past problems with wasteful and fraudulent contracts in Iraq, the Defense Department and in relation to Hurricane Katrina. 
   Congressional hearings have already shown that an estimated $10 billion in  Iraq reconstruction funds was wasted as a result of overcharging, poor tracking and mismanagement by U.S. contractors, three times more than was estimated just last fall. Unfortunately, these accounts have abounded under the Bush administration. Defense auditors estimate that at least one out of six dollars spent in Iraq is suspect, including $2.7 billion in Halliburton contracts. 
   Almost 19 post-Hurricane Katrina contracts worth a total of $8.75 billion have been plagued by waste, fraud and mismanagement; and only 30 percent of the more than $10 billion in Katrina contracts were awarded with full and open competition. And when it comes down to the small contractors who are actually hauling away the rubble and debris, they were not getting paid properly. This bill will help stop these kinds of wasteful contracts that keep the real work from getting done, that keep our neighbors from recovering from a natural disaster, and that keep the real workers from getting paid. 
   In my Tampa Bay area district, the Federal defense procurement revolving door has been the subject of Federal investigations in Federal district court proceedings in Tampa over the past several years. So it is vital we stand up for the folks we represent and demand their Federal tax dollars are spent correctly, especially when it comes to national security. That means having tough and fair oversight and a transparent system so there are no conflicts of interest. 
   So I commend the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Chair, Mr. Waxman, for his diligent efforts. I also commend the House Armed Services Chair, Ike Skelton, and my fellow members of the Armed Services Committee for their work on this legislation. When we marked this bill up in the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, this effort won bipartisan and unanimous support. It deserves no less by the full House today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 860 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, under the standard conference report rule. 
   Madam Speaker, today the Congress will promote a stronger and safer America by approving the National Defense Authorization conference report and this rule. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, which is chaired by the distinguished gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), I am pleased to report that the committee has worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the tools they need to keep America safe and strong. 
   Our military personnel and their families have sacrificed so much in past years and continue to do so. In recognition of their service, this Congress is proud to make important improvements in military pay and benefits. We have raised the pay of our brave men and women in uniform beyond the levels set originally by the President. And when our brave men and women in combat are injured in the line of duty, they deserve top quality medical care. The Walter Reed scandal drew back the curtain on some of the challenges that the military community faces when it comes to serving our brave men and women when they return from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the military health care system was not providing consistent, excellent care for our wounded soldiers. So, Madam Speaker, one of the highlights of this bill are our efforts to improve assistance to wounded warriors. These provisions have been worked on throughout the year in a bipartisan way to improve the health care for our wounded servicemembers because they deserve nothing but the best. 
   We move beyond the ``support our troops'' rhetoric and enact substantive improvements that will restore confidence in the quality of care that our brave men and women in uniform deserve when they return from the battlefield. This includes assistance to their very supportive families, because supporting our troops does not simply mean that you salute and send them off to war and then ask them to serve and sacrifice for our great country, but supporting our troops means that we continue to support them when they return home. 
   This bill improves the screening for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. I am very proud to recognize the efforts of my hometown VA Medical Center, the James A. Haley Medical Center, which is home to one of the four polytrauma centers in the country where we have so many dedicated doctors, nurses and psychologists and folks in physical therapy. They are so dedicated to these brave men and women that come home with the worst injuries. But we have got to do more. And that is contained in this bill. 
   This bill also mandates that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs establish a standard for rating servicemembers' disabilities that takes into consideration all of their medical conditions. 
   An important part of improving the health care and mental health care for our wounded warriors is tackling the bureaucracy that has blocked their access to health care. So we require expedited action, provide medical advocates, improve support services for families, elevate the care for traumatic brain injuries and aid the polytrauma centers in VA hospitals across the country that are serving the most critically wounded troops. 
   This bill also blocks an increase that was proposed by the White House to health insurance premiums for military families and troops under the TRICARE system. It is inexplicable how the White House could propose health insurance premium increases at a time when we are asking so much of our brave American men and women in uniform. So, proudly, the Congress, in a bipartisan way, blocks these health insurance premium increases. 
   Madam Speaker, we know that because of the multiyear, sometimes seemingly unending war in Iraq, that the readiness, the military readiness of our country has suffered over the years. Well, this bill restores the readiness of our Armed Forces, including equipment repair, so that our soldiers go to battle with the most up-to-date equipment available. In terms of readiness, we have authorized moneys for a new Strategic Readiness Fund and to address equipment deficiencies. We have all heard stories of soldiers, especially the folks in our National Guard and Reserves, who are having problems with equipment shortages and even receiving the necessary training that they need before heading off to war. In some cases, the National Guard has been unable to help in the traditional disaster response roles in their local communities due to this problem. Well, this bill tackles that so we can improve the readiness of the National Guard and Reserves so they can do their jobs safely, efficiently and effectively. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill also calls for greater accountability over the waste and fraud in Iraq that has been all too prevalent under this administration. This includes the troubles we have had with various contractors. As we see from the fallout of the Blackwater contracting debacles, there has been so much waste and fraud in contracting in Iraq and under this White House that we are not going to put up with it any longer. This bill substantially improves oversight of the multibillion-dollar and sometimes sole-source contracts that have been approved during this war in Iraq. 
   The Armed Services Committee, under Chairman Skelton's leadership, also requires additional accountability measures for Afghanistan, including a new Inspector General for Afghanistan reconstruction, as we cannot sanction the waste and fraud that has accompanied the administration's Iraq reconstruction. 
   Madam Speaker, many believe that because of the White House's preoccupation in Iraq that that preoccupation has shortchanged the focus in Afghanistan where the Taliban allowed al Qaeda to flourish some years ago. And, after all, the ungoverned and dangerous tribal areas of Pakistan are just south of the Afghan border. Indeed,  just yesterday, listening to the Defense Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Armed Services Committee, it became apparent that we are not able to do as much as we would like to do in Afghanistan because of the resources that have been overwhelmingly devoted to Iraq. Well, in this bill, we direct more attention to operations in Afghanistan in addition to an Inspector General that will oversee reconstruction efforts. This bill contains a long-term plan to improve stability in Afghanistan. 
   Madam Speaker, many of the unsung heroes of our Armed Forces whose missions you never hear about are the brave men and women in America's special forces. I am very proud that the headquarters of Special Operations Command is located in my hometown of Tampa, Florida, at MacDill Air Force Base. This defense bill under Democratic leadership not only fully funds our special forces but goes beyond the Bush administration's budget request for these brave men and women, including a number of needs that were not proposed to be funded by the White House at all. Our commitment to special forces recognizes that we cannot rely overwhelmingly any longer on conventional forces in defense of our country. We have got to be smarter. We have got to be more strategic. And this bill authorizes the increases in special forces and also a new emphasis on more strategic action. 
   Oftentimes, to win a struggle, it is more strategic and smarter not to go in with guns blazing but instead to work with folks on the ground to prevent any terrorist inclinations from ever developing. This bill does that. We will invest additional resources to improve education and analytical intelligence surveillance. We harness the science and technology innovation in this great country by investing in information technology and other technologies to make sure that our troops on the ground have the best technology available across the globe. 
   Madam Speaker, this Defense authorization bill and this rule charts a new direction for true readiness, accountability and more strategic investments to protect our national security. It improves the health care needs for our wounded warriors and does a better job of helping our families work through the unending maze of benefits and paperwork that come from caring for an injured soldier. 
   I urge full, bipartisan support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, today the House will vote on and hopefully pass the emergency supplemental bill. To the individuals who disagree with this new direction and our demand for accountability, I ask, how much longer will you continue to sanction the undermining of our national security under the Bush-Cheney policy? As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I ask this because this bill states that ``no units may be deployed to Iraq unless they are fully mission capable.'' 
   What are you saying if you vote against this measure? In the Armed Services Committee, the Army Chief of Staff testified that the Bush-Cheney strategy is outstripping the means to execute it. Our ground forces in the U.S. are short of training, personnel and equipment. This is very serious, and I ask how anyone can vote against this bill and sanction the unwise Bush-Cheney course. 
   The risk to our Nation is serious and deepening. We must change direction, make more strategic decisions and bring our diplomatic, economic and moral forces to bear to protect our national security.

   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 403 provides for consideration of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides 90 minutes of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. The rule waives all points of order against the bill's consideration, except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for 50 amendments. The rule also permits the Chair of the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer amendments not earlier disposed of en bloc and debated for 20 minutes, equally divided and controlled by the Chair and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. The Chair of the Armed Services Committee also may request that amendments printed and ordered in the Rules Committee report be offered out of that order with appropriate notice on the floor. 
   Madam Speaker, today the new Congress, under Democratic leadership, will chart a new direction for a stronger and safer America through the adoption of the Defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585, and this rule. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to report that our committee, under the leadership of Chairman IKE SKELTON, passed the bill out of committee unanimously in a bipartisan way, 58-0. 
   The Defense bill provides $648.6 billion to support our brave American men and women in uniform, but it does much more. The provisions in the bill would repair the damage done to America's national security by this White House by improving the readiness of our Armed Forces, requiring accountability from the White House in its  Iraq policy and making more strategic investments for the protection of the American people and our interests across the globe. 
   On readiness, we are going to take care of our troops and their families. We are going to fully fund the needs of our armed services. We are going to strengthen the National Guard and Reserves. 
   Here are a few details. We have authorized $1.2 billion for body armor; $2.5 billion for up-armored Humvees; $1.2 billion for vehicle add-on armor; and $509 million for the armored security vehicles. We are going to increase the end-strength of our armed services with 36,000 new soldiers in the Army, 9,000 new troops in the Marine Corps and 1,300 troops in the Army National Guard. 
   This bill authorizes $4.5 billion to fund the anti-IED, improvised explosive device, efforts of the Joint Improved Explosive Device Defeat Organization. 
   In addition, Madam Speaker, although the President called for only a 3 percent pay raise for our brave men and women in uniform, we have gone far beyond that because we recognize the sacrifice that they are providing for the benefit of the American people, and we have provided a pay raise in this bill for our troops of 3.5 percent. 
   Inexplicably, in this time of conflict and war the Bush administration also proposed increases in health insurance premiums for our military retirees and troops under TRICARE and proposed cuts to active military medical services. We have blocked that measure. It is the wrong time for the White House to propose health insurance premium increases, when we are asking so much of our brave American men and women in uniform. 
   Madam Speaker, in this bill we have also included provisions that we passed last month, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, because we remain committed to seeing that our wounded servicemembers receive the best health care possible. Indeed, Madam Speaker, under that Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, we are answering the call of the American people. This new Congress is demanding, through this rule and through this legislation, that the executive branch move beyond the rhetoric of ``support our troops'' to concrete actions that sustain our brave men and women in uniform and their families by providing the quality health care they deserve when they return from the battlefield. 
   Supporting our troops does not mean that you simply salute and send them off to war, ask them to serve and sacrifice for our great country. But it also means that they are supported when they return home, their families are respected and our wounded warriors receive superior health care for their physical injuries and mental health care. 
   We are going to improve the health care-mental health care for our wounded warriors in this bill. We are going to tackle the bureaucracy that has blocked their access to health care. We are going to require expedited action, provide medical advocates, improve support services for families and really tackle the traumatic brain injuries and aid the polytrauma centers and VA hospitals across this country that are serving the most crucially wounded. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill also calls for greater accountability from the White House. In this bill, we are requiring more in-depth reports on operations in Iraq. We want to know what is truly happening on the ground with the Iraqi security forces. 
   There has been so much waste and fraud in contracting in Iraq and under this White House that we are not going to put up with it any longer. The Department of Defense, the Department of State, USAID, must have additional oversight of the multibillion dollar contracts that have been approved during this war in Iraq. We require reports on the proficiencies of the Iraqi Army, the police, and all security forces there. 
   To the credit of this Armed Services Committee, we have not forgotten about Afghanistan. In fact, in this bill, as an additional accountability measure, we have established an Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, as we cannot sanction the waste and fraud that has accompanied the administration's Iraq reconstruction. 
   Madam Speaker, we are also going to be more strategic in the defense of our national security. Like I said, Afghanistan cannot be the forgotten war. In fact, in this bill we direct more attention to operations there, in addition to the Inspector General that will oversee the reconstruction efforts. This bill contains a detailed plan to achieve long-term stability in what has been an unstable country in Afghanistan for many years. 
   Madam Speaker, we will hear debate today about missile defense. Now, this bill provides great investment in the protection and missile defense of this country. It also reinvigorates the nonproliferation and threat reduction initiatives that have suffered under the Bush administration. We are going to refocus our efforts strategically on terrorism and the true threats to our national security. 
   I am very proud to say that the headquarters of Special Operations Command is located in my district in Tampa, Florida, at the McDill Air Force Base. This Defense bill, under Democratic leadership, not only fully funds our Special Operations Forces, but it went beyond the Bush administration's budget request, and we have funded their five unfunded needs under the Bush proposal. 
   We have also authorized a 25 percent increase in Special Forces by the year 2013, because we recognize that we cannot rely solely any longer on the conventional threats to our country. We have got to be smarter, we have to be more strategic, and the Democratic Defense bill authorizes the increase in Special Forces and also a new emphasis on indirect action. 
   Oftentimes, to win the hearts and minds, you don't go in with guns blazing. In fact, you institute a smarter policy where you work with folks on the ground to prevent any terrorist initiative from ever developing. And this bill does that. 
   We have reinvested additional resources to improve education and analytical intelligence surveillance. We harness the science and technology innovation in this country by investing in information technology and other technologies to make sure that our troops on the ground have the best technology available across the globe. 
   Yes, Madam Speaker, this Defense bill charts a new direction for true readiness, accountability and more strategic investments to protect our national security. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   The fact remains over 135 amendments were submitted on time to the Rules Committee, and a record-breaking number of 50 amendments are being allowed and made in order on this Defense bill. 
   I think it is also important to respond to the claims that missile defense is not funded through this bill. Indeed, that is incorrect. The record should reflect that only in Washington can a program be provided and funded with billions and billions of dollars for numerous decades; and then say, oh, we are suffering. In fact, that is not the case. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall), a member of the Armed Services Committee.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We did have a debate over missile defense in the Armed Services Committee, but at the end of the day, recall we had a unanimous vote, 58-0, bipartisan vote, to send this bill to the floor. 
   I would offer, there is no debate. We must protect this great country from nuclear threats, missile threats; and in fact, this bill does that. 
   We have provided $1.4 billion for Patriot PAC-3 and MEADS. These funds will be used to purchase additional interceptors, upgrade remaining firing units' configuration, continue the development of the MEADS program and purchase equipment for two additional Patriot battalions. 
   The committee also authorized $1.1 billion for Aegis BMD, an increase of $78 million above the budget request from the White House. These funds will be used to continue and expand the fielding of Standard Missile-3, improve the discrimination capabilities of the Aegis SPY1 radar, and continue the joint development with Japan of the SM-3 Block IIA missile. 
   We have authorized $2.3 billion for ground-based missile defense. 
   The committee supports THAAD and authorizes $858 million to continue the purchase of two THAAD firing units. So to come to the floor and say that missile defense is not provided for in this bill is incorrect. 
   What we are facing, though, is because of this war in Iraq, we have growing needs for the troops on the ground. So our committee made the decision that the troops on the ground come first; that they will have the body armor, they will have the MRAP vehicles, the mine-resistant vehicles, because that is the priority today. Tough decisions, but our troops come first on the ground. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson).

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think it is also very important for the record to reflect that the Army is fully funded in its needs. Indeed, $13.6 billion are authorized through this Defense bill to fully address the equipment reset of the Army. 
   What has happened, because of the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and we all know this, but readiness of our Armed Forces has suffered. Indeed, the Army Chief of Staff testified before the Armed Services Committee that the escalation of the war creates a terrible strategic risk for this country. 
   If there was any other threat from across the globe that threatened our national security, it would be very difficult for us to respond because all of the equipment, all of the trucks, the Humvees, are there in Iraq. When the units are deployed and go over to Iraq, they are not able to bring the equipment back. 
   This was highlighted recently in the State of Kansas with these terrible tornados, when the governor of Kansas told us directly that they were not able to respond as quickly. I'll tell you, coming from the State of Florida, at the beginning of the hurricane season, this is an issue. 
   We have also had to make these tough decisions about equipping our  warriors on the ground with the equipment that they need. 
   The Army came forward during their budget discussion in Armed Services and said our most critical need are these mine-resistant ambush vehicles that have the armor to withstand the IEDs that has caused so much death and destruction. The Bush administration did not have a funding plan for those MRAP vehicles. So what do we do? 
   We have got to provide the troops on the ground with the equipment they need to stay safe and survive. Does that mean that some other programs that aren't as tested and aren't as proven get a slight cut? Yes, it does. Yes, it does, because that is a priority, protecting the troops on the ground today.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, middle class families across America are struggling with the rising cost of health care, housing and gas prices brought on by the White House economic policies of the last 8 years. 
   Unfortunately, Big Oil continues to have a stranglehold over our country's energy policy. The latest proposal from their allies in the White House and other prominent Republicans is to drill for oil just off of our beaches. 
   But oil companies already have access to 68 million acres that they are not actively tapping, and the administration's own Energy Department reports that opening up new areas would have no impact on the price of gas. 
   True leaders are working on long-term solutions to reduce our dependence on oil and gas, promote conservation and new renewable technology. This has been the fundamental failure on energy policy of the Bush administration, and now Americans are paying the price. Do not reward Big Oil's latest attempt to grab even more. 
   Join us in fighting harmful speculation in petroleum markets and our efforts to end the massive, wasteful taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies. Short-term political gimmicks are no substitute for real leadership.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, the Small Business Contracting Improvements Act and this rule will open up greater opportunities to small business owners across this Nation. Small businesses are the backbone of our local communities. In my hometown of Tampa, Florida, more of my neighbors and folks I represent work for small businesses than any other type of business--and we value what they do because it gives our community character and diversity. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Vel&#225;zquez for bringing this legislation to the House floor today. In America, small businesses account for 50 percent of our gross domestic product. Last year, the federal government spent over $400 billion on goods and services and only about 20 percent went to small businesses--approximately $80 billion in contracts. Our actions today will assist these talented small businesses obtain a better, fair share of federal government contracts. 
   The Small Business Contracting Improvements Act also strengthens and modernizes contracts for small businesses and sets standards to protect the integrity and consistency. Despite a 50-year-old mandate, small businesses owned by disabled veterans, female entrepreneurs, and minorities have not received a fair share of federal contracts. Back home in Tampa, there are 47 disabled veteran businesses, 512 state-certified minority-owned businesses, and over 77,000 small businesses. I am proud that we will act to expand their opportunities, with others across the country so that they can thrive and flourish. 
   Although the Congress passed the Women's Procurement Program 7 years ago, the Bush Administration failed to follow through. According to Margot Dorfman, CEO of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, each year of delay in the implementation of the Women's Procurement Program, has cost women-owned businesses billions of dollars in contract award opportunities. 
   Businesses owned by disabled veterans currently receive only a small fraction of federal contracts as well. We can expect to see an immediate and substantial increase in opportunities for these business owners. 
   And for businesses that go into economically distressed neighborhoods like ``HUBZones,'' this bill will ensure further community development through the strengthening of the HUBZone requirements. For example, Carl Calhoun, in South St. Petersburg explained to me that had it not been for the chance to compete for federal contracts that he would not have gotten the capital necessary to start his family-owned and -operated business that manufactures premium bedding (mattresses, box springs and foundations). 
   Mr. Chairman, this important small business bill and this rule will update and expand opportunities and encourage participation by qualified small businesses. We will remove barriers that prevent deserving businesses in my Tampa Bay district, and others across the country, from achieving the goal of full participation and a fair share of federal contracts.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my district in the Tampa Bay area to herald the terrific achievement of our hometown hero, Tony Dungy. While Coach Dungy is the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl title, he is also a living testimony to faithful leadership. 
   Since Coach Dungy's 11-year path to the Super Bowl title came through my hometown of Tampa, I think it is fair to say that everyone in the Tampa Bay area feels attached to his win, and we are proud to claim him as a resident. My friends and neighbors back home remember Coach Dungy as the former coach of the Buccaneers, who in that capacity brought a winning spirit and  gracious leadership to that team and our community. 
   We watched with pride Sunday when this man showed that nice guys can finish first. His team came from eight points behind, withstood the weather and won the game. Coach Dungy, as the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl, provides the perfect start to the month-long celebration of Black History Month. His victory follows the march of other men and women who have stood up for justice and opened doors for others. 
   Congratulations to him and all that understand that perseverance and teamwork is the best answer to life's obstacles.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that, over time, will keep insurance rates down by directing that State and local governments not approve intensified development in high-risk areas like our coastal high-hazard areas. 
   Insurance premiums are on the rise for many reasons, but one of the most significant reasons for skyrocketing costs of insurance is developer overbuilding in high-risk areas. 
   Developers and homebuilders have crowded on to the coasts and into the flood plains, fire zones, and other high-risk areas, without considering the consequences. The subsequent consequences to the folks that we represent have been very expensive. 
   These developers set up homeowners and businesses for financial ruin and personal tragedy when they locate in areas that are at high risk of natural disasters, and the developers are profiting at the expense of every policyholder whose premiums continue to rise without relief once another disaster hits. 
   Unfortunately, State and local governments have been too often complicit in this irresponsible behavior. 
   The amendment I offer today requires that States that participate in this innovative risk pool adopt policies to limit development in high-risk areas. It would also end the practice of rebuilding properties after a catastrophe with development that is of a greater size or a greater density or intensity, because the right to rebuild in high-risk areas is not the right to expand. 
   Now, this bill, carefully crafted by my thoughtful colleagues from Florida, provides States with an innovative tool to tackle the property insurance crisis. And my amendment improves the bill by preventing any greater problems down the road. The amendment aims to stop developer overbuilding that will lead to even greater disasters in the future and higher property insurance rates. 
   Now, I do appreciate the suggestion from the chairman of the Financial Services Committee that this amendment can be improved still, and I'll yield to the gentleman, because I am interested in your advice and assurance that maybe down the road, if I happen to withdraw the amendment, that we can work to improve.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 802 provides for consideration of H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007, under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. This rule allows for floor consideration of any amendment that is in compliance with the House rules and the Congressional Budget Act and has been preprinted in the Congressional Record. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the face of natural catastrophes that too often strike our communities, the Congress today will initiate a new planning effort through H.R. 3355 and this rule. This new effort will assist our communities and hopefully tackle the rising cost of homeowners property insurance. 
   My colleagues from Florida, Representative RON KLEIN and Representative TIM MAHONEY, have led this bipartisan effort. I thank them for their tireless work and leadership, their leadership that should help our neighbors back home and folks across this country find affordable and available homeowners insurance. 
   Following some of the most expensive natural disasters in our Nation's history, like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Wilma and the fires and the floods and the earthquakes, homeowners across this country have been subjected to wild fluctuations and horrendous cost increases for their property insurance. Insurance premiums are out of sight. They have skyrocketed. Well, we understand. We feel it in our own bills. 
   I hear it from the retired older woman in West Tampa back home who has owned her house for 30 years and is on a fixed income. But this exponential increase in insurance that she has suffered may force her to sell her long-time home. 
   I also hear it from the hardworking folks in south St. Petersburg who have been cancelled by their insurance companies after decades of paying their premiums without making any claim upon that insurer. 
   Due to all of the policy cancellations, we now have a crisis. Insurers have fled the State. In some areas, insurance premiums have gone beyond what any reasonable person would consider anything that they can handle in their everyday lives. A rate increase of over 600 percent is not unheard of. Some of our neighbors are having to rethink their retirements because they can no longer afford to live in their homes. But if they tried to sell, nobody can afford to buy those homes. 
   And, unbelievably, the State of Florida is now the largest provider of homeowners property insurance in our State. This problem is not limited to the State of Florida, however. Across the country over the past 5 years, homeowners insurance premiums have increased by over 45 percent on average. In Florida, that average increase is over 77 percent. And there seems to be no end in sight unless we work to create innovative options, like this bill, that will bring stability back to the marketplace and sanity back to insurance premiums. 
   Over 3 million loyal policyholders, many of whom have never submitted a single claim, have received letters from their insurance companies, nondescript envelopes that carry the message, ``Your policy is not eligible to be renewed.'' 
   Last month a story caught my eye entitled, ``Home Insurers Canceling in the East.'' It said that insurance companies have essentially begun to redraw the outline of the eastern United States somewhere west of the Appalachian Trail. 
   Faced with the risk of their citizens being priced out or thrown out of private insurance markets, States have begun to take action. The State insurance program in Massachusetts has doubled as a result of the insurance crisis. My home State of Florida is now insuring 1.3 million policyholders. But the States did not ask to be put in this position. They tried to reason with the private insurance companies. They created incentives, they pushed, they urged them not to leave folks high and dry and to keep insurance available and affordable. Even though the insurance industry made record profits the year of Hurricane Katrina, private insurers have still left the gulf coast. 
   Times of crisis like these often lead to innovative solutions, however. My colleagues, Representative RON KLEIN and Representative TIM MAHONEY, national insurance risk consortium that will allow States better access to private capital as a backstop for these huge, catastrophic losses. The consortium will help States work together to bundle that risk into bonds that can succeed on the private capital markets. Because this program is voluntary and relies on private investment, the new consortiums should not expose Federal taxpayers to any risk whatsoever. Catastrophe bonds through the consortium will help stabilize insurance markets, bring down premiums, and move forward in providing available, affordable insurance to our constituents. 
   The bill, with foresight and commonsense, also addresses the worst-case scenario, because, God forbid, there will be another catastrophic event and States will be on the hook to pay claims. And most of the time this will not be a problem, but there are some disasters for which no preparation is enough. In those cases, historically this body, the Congress, has written emergency assistance bills, and it is right that we should do so. But this bill allows States to take control of their own fates by lessening the need for those Federal disaster appropriations by making Federal loans available to help States pay claims when that colossal disaster happens. 
   This is a compassionate, fiscally responsible way to ensure that Americans are not left without aid in their time of greatest need. This bill is a simple, effective way to tackle the crisis of skyrocketing property insurance. I ask my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, we're here on the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007 and this rule. This is an innovative solution crafted by my very thoughtful colleagues from Florida, Representative RON KLEIN and Representative TIM MAHONEY, to tackle the rising cost of property insurance. 
   While the problem is especially acute in the State of Florida, it is not limited to the State of Florida. Look all the way up the coastline from Florida to Georgia, up through New York. Everyone is suffering these double-digit percentage increases in their property insurance bills. Look across the country to California and, yes, to Texas. Florida is not alone and the gulf coast is not alone. 
   What this requires is some innovative, thoughtful thinking that sometimes is all too often missing here in Washington, but thankfully this new Congress has elected some self-starters who have experience in business and know how business and government can work together to bring real solutions for the American people. 
   These times of crisis demand innovative solutions, and my colleagues from Florida and the Financial Services Committee that passed this bill in a bipartisan vote, that has brought this to the floor today that we can act on will provide a voluntary, not all States participate, it's a voluntary national insurance risk consortium that will  allow States to tap private capital. Despite the protests from the other side of the aisle, the way this bill is crafted is the taxpayers will not be on the hook for additional disaster claims. To the contrary, this is an attempt to alleviate having to come back to the Congress time and time again in a time of natural disasters. 
   Now, will we be able to solve natural catastrophes in this bill? No. But is it a smart tool to plan ahead, to try to put some money aside early and create a backstop? Yes. 
   So I thank all of my colleagues from Florida, especially Representative Klein and Representative Mahoney, because we have got to do something, and this is a simple and effective way to tackle the rising costs for property insurance. I ask my colleagues to support the rule and to support this innovative solution. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3648, MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my colleague from California, who continues to be a leader for homeowners across this country as they face very troubling times. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Debt Relief Act of 2007 and this rule. I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and the House Ways and Means Committee for moving quickly on this critical legislation. 
   Our efforts today will help families across America who have had to bear the unfortunate burden of their homes going into foreclosure. You see, under current law, after a homeowner loses their home to foreclosure, they are forced to pay income tax on that debt forgiveness. So although the homeowner has lost their assets, they must suffer the immeasurable strain of a tax bill that they are often unable to pay. 
   When a family has lost their home to foreclosure or has been unable to renegotiate their loan with their lender to reflect the current value of their home, homeowners under current law are being confronted with an unfair and, frankly, unaffordable tax bill. Our legislation on the floor of the House today will help. 
   This is simply an issue of fairness for struggling families and homeowners. It is unfair for a family to pay a tax on their income that they actually do not receive. When a bank forgives some amount of debt for a homeowner, either to avoid foreclosure or simply to forgive a debt to a homeowner already in the foreclosure process, the amount of the forgiven debt is treated by the IRS as income, which is then taxed. For families already struggling to make ends meet, the phantom income and resulting tax burden generated by this can endanger their financial health even further. This bill will fix this double whammy. 
   With the current housing crisis that exists in our country, especially from the subprime lending market, it is no wonder that so many families have found themselves in unfortunate situations when it comes to their homes. Relieving families of this tax burden is the least we can do to help our families and all that they are trying to do in their everyday lives. 
   My colleague from Florida is correct: in August, the State of Florida had the second highest total of foreclosure filings, up 77 percent from the previous month. Florida is ranked third in the United States for overall foreclosures this year, and nationwide foreclosures up are 115 percent. 
   In my home district in the Tampa Bay area, over 10,000 of my neighbors have found their homes falling into foreclosure within the first 6 months of this year. Well, we are going to extend a lifeline today, and believe me, it matters. 
   Last month, I visited with one of my neighbors, Isaline Wyatt. She is a single mother of two in east Tampa who was very close to losing her home to foreclosure. Fortunately, she was able to keep her home with the help of Neighborworks, a community action group. But many of our neighbors are in similar situations, and they do not have the same prospects. I promised Isaline and our neighbors throughout the Tampa Bay area that we would work to ensure that help is within reach. 
   I am proud to say that today we will keep that promise and help bring relief to my hardworking neighbors. We will keep them from being faced with unaffordable, large tax bills as a result of foreclosure or renegotiating mortgages. 
   In the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, the talented and caring staff at the local Neighborworks center work hard every day to keep homeowners in their home. Since January, they have assisted 65 families. Homeowners like Joann Carnaham of St. Petersburg are working desperately with Neighborworks so they don't lose their homes. Joann fell behind on her mortgage payment because she lost her job. The house she lived in belonged to her parents. She refinanced for $80,000. Her father was still there, but he passed away, and she had to pay all of his bills. Due to lack of income and her father's death, she was unable to negotiate a payment plan with her mortgage company. Under current law, if Joann's home goes into foreclosure, she will be hit with an income tax bill that she is in absolutely no position to pay. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 will aid families and people like Joann in St. Petersburg and help them get back on their feet after foreclosure. With the whirlwind of problems in the mortgage finance system, this bill will help stabilize families in our neighborhood, and I urge adoption today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1107 provides for consideration of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order four amendments in the Rules Committee report, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, and the underlying rule. Under this act, the Congress will ensure that low-interest student loans remain available for college students and their families even in the face of the credit crunch. In doing so, the Congress will build on the new commitment to college and university students and their hardworking families that this new Democratic majority has provided. 
   See, our action today comes on the heels of the historic College Cost Reduction and Access Act that was signed into law a few months ago that saves college students an average of $4,400 on student loan interest. We increased the Pell Grant, and we now will forgive student loans for students that commit to a 10-year career in public service. 
   This single largest investment in college financial assistance since the GI Bill in 1944 comes at no new cost to taxpayers. The new Congress promised to make college more affordable for all Americans, and we have delivered on that promise. 
   Our next step today is to ensure that families can continue to access the loans they need to pay for college. See, in today's economy, a college education is as important as a high school diploma was a generation ago. And with college costs growing by nearly 40 percent over the last 5 years, students are graduating from college with more debt than ever before. It is estimated that 200,000 students do not go to college every year because they simply cannot afford the costs. Well, our efforts today will restore the American dream for those families.  
   We know that many families across this great country are facing severe financial strains. The economic downturn, the cost of housing, the cost of health care, gas prices have hit our families especially hard. Middle class families are especially being squeezed in this unfortunate Bush economy. 
   In addition to these basic needs, the rising cost of a college education has left many families very concerned that a college education may not be within reach for their children. A recent press report noted that 70 percent of parents said that they are very concerned about how they're going to be able to afford the cost of a college education for their kids. 
   Families now are forced to pull from many different sources to pay for college and to simply make ends meet. They're drawing on their savings account, Federal loans, private loans, and the equity in their homes all at the same time to send their kids to college. And despite all of their hard work and the fact that they've set money aside, they're still unable to come up with the cost of tuition because these costs are rising. The costs of sending their child away to school or just down the street to the community college is simply out of reach for so many so they turn to the loans. 
   In 2007, families borrowed almost $60 billion in Federal student loans. Now, in this credit crunch, banks are tightening their loan requirements and raising rates. We want to make sure that families have access to the low-interest loans, that they remain available for these hardworking families so their kids can attend college. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill has a number of very significant improvements under our Federal college loan program. The best deal going in college loans these days is the Stafford loan. We are going to increase the annual loan limit for the Stafford loan by $2,000 for undergraduates and graduate students. These loans are the most affordable and available to students with the best interest rates. 
   Currently, there's a cap on the amount that a student can receive, so our legislation today will raise that cap. It increases the total loan limit, as well, over the course of a student's college education from $31,000 for dependent undergraduates to $57,500 for independent graduate students. 
   The other significant loan available to families these days is the Parent PLUS loan. The Parent PLUS loan, the primary benefit for the PLUS loan for parents is that they can borrow Federally guaranteed low-interest loans, not tied to the students, but that's a loan for the parents. The parents can borrow the total cost of undergraduate education including tuition, room and board, supplies, lab expenses, and travel, and other aids. It's a non-need-based loan. Well, we're going to give parents a little more flexibility under our actions today to pay off their PLUS loans. 
   Currently, those loans become due 60 days after the bill is sent to them. We're going to give them a little extra time and allow the student to complete their college education before that loan becomes due. We're going to help struggling homeowners pay for college because right now, it is not clear under the law that parents that are struggling with pending foreclosure or difficulty in paying their housing costs can also access the great PLUS loans to help their kids get through college. So we're going to allow for that today. 
   We're also going to give the Department of Education additional tools so that these, the cost of college and the access to student loans, remain available for America's hardworking families. 
   I would like to thank Chairman George Miller of the Education and Labor Committee here in the House for his leadership on making sure that families continue to have access for student loans but for also being a champion for American families, colleges, and our entire educational system which is in better hands now that the Democrats are in charge here in the House. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, today the Congress will build on the new commitment to college and university students and their hardworking families that this new Democratic majority in the Congress has provided. Our efforts to ensure continued access to low-cost student loans for families comes on the heels of the historic College Cost Reduction and Access Act that was signed into law a few months ago that will save college students an average of $4,400 on student loan interest, will increase the Pell Grant, and will forgive loans for those who provide 10 years of public service to their community. 
   This is the single largest investment in college financial assistance since the  GI Bill in 1944 and comes at no new cost to taxpayers. The new Congress promised to make college more affordable for all Americans, and we have delivered on that promise. 
   Our next step today is to ensure that families can continue to access the loans they need to pay for college. And let me provide you with one example from my hometown in Tampa, Florida: a student at the University of South Florida, a large public university of over 40,000 students. This student is a communications major and is one semester away from graduation. But she has reached her loan limit. She can't access that Stafford Loan that provides the lowest interest rate available out there. She is the first in her family to ever attend college. She only lacks 11 credit hours to graduate, and she plans to graduate this summer, but she has been forced to apply for a higher interest rate, private loan, to cover the expenses of her summer tuition. Well, this legislation is ready-made for her and thousands of other students across America and their families. It gives them that extra-added flexibility to be able to put the money to good use and graduate on time rather than end up paying higher loans and interest rates. 
   You see, Madam Speaker, we're not just Members of Congress. We are also parents ourselves. And we are also concerned about the increasing cost of college, especially given the fact that college costs have been increasing more rapidly than available grant and financial aid, Federal loans, and families' ability to pay. Well, our efforts today will restore the American Dream for many families. And we know and appreciate that many families are facing extreme financial strains. The economic downturn, the cost of housing, the cost of health care, gas prices have hit our families hard. Families are really being squeezed in this unfortunate Bush economy. 
   But there is a reason to hope because we will continue to fight for a new direction for our country, a direction that values access to education, values better jobs, and values an opportunity for all Americans. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.  
   Mr. McKeon. Madam Speaker, this rule will allow consideration of a bill that takes a critical first step in addressing disturbances in the student loan financial markets brought on by broader market turmoil. 
   We've all read the headlines and spoken with our constituents about this difficult economy. Our economic confidence has been shaken, and people are nervous. But what may be overlooked is that students and families thinking about how to pay for college are in a particular bind. 
   It's hard enough to pay for college when tuition regularly rises at two or three times the rate of inflation and textbooks can run close to $1,000 each year. Add to that the idea that lenders are scaling back on student loans, and it's easy to see why Americans are nervous about paying for college. 
   Like most challenges to our economy, there's no easy answer to the difficulties in our student loan programs. We will need a combination of actions--maybe some legislatively, others through regulation--that will increase liquidity and restore confidence among investors and consumers. 
   This bill is a first step, and one that deserves bipartisan support. It signals our commitment to a strong Federal Family Education Loan program, and should help ease the minds of students and families. And it does these things without a cost to the taxpayer. 
   Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that the bill is not being brought up under an open rule. H.R. 5715 was developed on a bipartisan basis, and is stronger because of it. The idea that members will not be permitted to collaborate on this effort to protect college students and their families is disappointing, if not surprising given the track record of the 110th Congress. 
   I will oppose this rule because it limits the full participation of all members. But I will strongly support the underlying measure, H.R. 5715, when it is brought to the floor and I urge all my colleagues to join me in telling students and families that we are committed to college access.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2317, LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2316, HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 2317, the Lobbying Transparency Act of 2007, and H.R. 2316, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. 
   The resolution provides that H.R. 2317 is to be considered under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its consideration, except for those arising under clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The resolution also provides for consideration of H.R. 2316, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its consideration, except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order and provides the appropriate waivers for five amendments, three by Democratic Members and two by Republican Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 and the Lobbying Transparency Act as well and this rule. 
   The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act continues the new direction charted by this new Congress and builds upon the strongest ethics reforms ever adopted in the United States Congress. 
   Last November, the Congress was reinvigorated by the election of a large number of new Members, who were sent here by the American people to fight for reform and change and to sweep aside a previous Congress that was defined by scandal and corruption. 
   On the first day of this new Congress, the new reform-minded Members, under the leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and Rules Committee Chair Louise Slaughter, ushered in the broadest ethics and lobbying revisions since the Watergate era. The ethics watchdog group Public Citizen called the new ethics rules sweeping in scope and a signal that the Democratic majority in the House appears committed to serious lobbying and ethics reform. 
   Those new rules include a ban on gifts from lobbyists and organizations that employ lobbyists, a ban on trips that are privately funded by lobbyists and organizations that employ lobbyists, prohibition on Members and staff flying on private corporate jets, an end to the K Street Project, and a new requirement that all earmarks with congressional sponsors be disclosed to the public. 
   Then 3 weeks after the adoption of that very broad and aggressive ethics reform rules package, the House acted again on ethics reform and stripped the congressional pensions of Members of Congress who commit any of a number of crimes during their tenure, including bribery, conspiracy and perjury. 
   This new Congress took that direct action to change the culture of Congress at a time when Members of the previous Congress were pleading guilty to living off gifts they had received from lobbyists in exchange for votes and earmarks. Through our bold and expanding ethics package, this new Congress is tackling the cozy relationships between lobbyists and lawmakers. 
   Next, Mr. Speaker, these bills that we will consider today, the one for open government and honest leadership and transparency in lobbying, and this rule, provide rigorous new requirements for lobbyist disclosure and enforcement of lobbying laws and regulations. 
   Mr. Speaker, we don't adopt reforms for reform's sake alone. We adopt these reforms and we fight for change because it matters to our constituents and our neighbors back home. 
   For over a year I have been sitting down with seniors trying to work through the disaster of Medicare part D that was crafted in the last Congress. Fortunately, this bill adds a House rule prohibiting Members and senior staff from negotiating future employment or salaries and requires public recusal of Members on any matters where there may be a conflict of interest. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, that Medicare part D that is so costly and confusing to our seniors and puts all the benefit on the side of HMOs and Big Pharma, and puts all of the burden on our seniors, was crafted by a Member of Congress who, shortly thereafter, after he helped write the Medicare drug bill, went on to become the head lobbyist for PhRMA in what I think was a crass violation of the public trust. Fortunately, this bill will tackle that problem. 
   This bill also makes it a Federal crime for Members and senior staff to influence employment decisions or practices of private entities for partisan political gain. Some people have called this the K Street Project. The K Street Project was an initiative by the Republican Party to pressure Washington lobbying firms to hire Republicans in top positions and to reward loyal GOP lobbyists with access to influential officials. 
   The bill also requires quarterly instead of semiannual disclosure of lobbying reports. It requires in the age of the Internet for lobbying reports to be filed electronically and be made available in a free, searchable, downloadable database within 48 hours of being filed. 
   It also requires the Clerk of the House to post travel disclosures on the Internet. This follows the scandals of Jack Abramoff. We must allow greater transparency into the trips and financial holdings of Members of Congress. Former Members of Congress took lavish trips to Scotland with a lobbyist that had minimal disclosure, and these new provisions will bring more such light to congressional disclosure forms. 
   Through this legislation we will also increase civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements. And it does much, much more. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to fight for high ethical standards in government to end the culture of corruption in Washington so that our neighbors and folks we represent know they can count on us to stand up for them against powerful special interests and trust that congressional Members work in the public interest. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act and the Lobbying Transparency Act and this rule. Citizens deserve open and honest leadership. We must stay on track with lobbying reform. And after the scandals in past years, we will continue the fight for reform and change so that the American people trust that Members of Congress are making decisions that benefit our communities and our country, and not some powerful special interest with undue influence. 
   Unfortunately, there has been a price to pay for the culture of corruption. You can see it when you gas up at the pump. Big Oil has gotten millions and billions in tax breaks, while people that we represent pay higher gas prices. And in Florida, the big oil companies have been granted a right to drill off our beautiful coastline. 
   You can see it when our seniors are pushed into privatized Medicare. The HMOs get a slush fund, and seniors pay more for health care. 
   You can see it when students and their families pay more for student loans because of sweetheart deals. The special interests get tax breaks, and our kids pay off higher debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we will keep our promise to the American people to fight for change and reform. When our neighbors and the folks back home send us to Washington, they rightly expect their representatives to act in the public interest and not in the interest of well-paid lobbyists with undue influence. 
   I urge my colleagues to build on the strongest ethics reform ever adopted in the Congress, what we started on day one in this new Congress. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 922 provides for consideration of H.R. 3524, the HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the Committee on Financial Services, and the rule also makes in order seven of the eight amendments submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today of the HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act and this rule. HOPE VI is a partnership between the Feds and local communities that started in the 1990s that revitalizes our communities across this country by replacing old, distressed public housing projects with modern housing and new communities that are healthy, safe and affordable. 
   Our renewed effort could not come at a more important time, because so many families across America are in the grips of a housing crisis. Foreclosures are way up, and options for safe, clean and affordable housing are down. Just last month in my home county, Hillsborough County, in Florida, there were over 1,000 foreclosures filed, a huge jump from last year. And affordable apartments and housing are few and far between. 
   The House of Representatives over the past months has been doing a great deal to throw lifelines to our families, our seniors and veterans when it comes to housing. We have passed bills in this House that help homeowners avoid foreclosure, that provide resources to local communities, to build safe and clean affordable housing, and that cracks down on predatory lending. 
   Families across America also should be aware that the Congress passed a helpful new law that is now in effect for 3 years that relieves homeowners  facing foreclosure from paying income taxes on their discharged mortgage debt, meaning that homeowners who refinance their mortgage will pay no taxes on any debt forgiveness that they receive. Previously, loan forgiveness was often taxed as income. 
   We are going to keep working to provide families with affordable options for safe places to live through the HOPE VI reauthorization and this rule today.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1538, WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 274 provides for consideration of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour and 20 minutes of general debate with 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services, and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   The rule waives all points of orders against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Armed Services shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended. 
   The rule makes in order only those further amendments printed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution; in this case, eight Democratic amendments and four Republican amendments. The amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against the amendment except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI are waived. 
   The rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Finally, the rule permits the Chair, during consideration of H.R. 1538, to postpone further consideration to a time designated by the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people and this new Congress demand, through this rule and this legislation, that the executive branch move beyond the rhetoric of ``support our troops'' to concrete actions that sustain our brave men and women in uniform and their families by providing the quality health care they deserve when they return from the battlefield. 
   Supporting our troops does not mean that you simply salute as you send them off to war, ask them to serve in sacrifice for our great country, but it also means that they are supported when they come home, their families are respected, and our wounded warriors receive superior health care for their physical injuries and mental scars. 
   This might sound familiar from the Washington Post: ``The conflict in Iraq has hatched a town of desperation and dysfunction, clinging to the pilings of Walter Reed. The wounded are socked away for months and years in random buildings and barracks in and around the military post. Mostly what the soldiers do together is wait: for appointments, evaluation, signatures and lost paperwork to be found. `It's like,' one military wife said, `if Iraq don't kill you, Walter Reed will.' While a part of Walter Reed has a full bar, there is not one counselor or psychologist assigned there to assist soldiers and families in crisis--an idea proposed by Walter Reed social workers but rejected by the military command that runs the post.'' 
   To the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I say what a shame that the American people had to have their eyes opened by two dedicated Washington Post reporters as to the treatment of our veterans, the incompetence and the profound disrespect. These reporters spent hundreds of hours documenting the intimate struggles of the wounded warriors who live at Walter Reed. Their stories triggered others from across the country, like in my hometown paper, the Tampa Tribune. 
   The Tampa Tribune last week told the story of soldier John Barnes who was injured by a mortar in Iraq just last year. Barnes was fortunate, he had a mother who was a dedicated nurse who stood by him during his days at Walter Reed. 
   Barnes, now 23, was frequently left unattended, his mother, Valerie Wallace said, even though he had a severe brain injury. He fell repeatedly. Orderlies failed to arrive on time to wheel him to appointments. Medicines were given in the wrong doses; paperwork was lost or never filed. 
   `` `I don't think anybody planned this war far out,' said Wallace, an energetic woman who looks younger than her 45 years. `If you are going to invade a country and you are expecting to be there for years, you've got to know there are going to be thousands of casualties,' she said. `How are you going to take care of them? Where are you going to put them?' 
   ``Wallace is a registered nurse who has worked for more than a decade at Tampa General Hospital. She wasn't intimidated by the staff at Walter Reed, and she knew what questions to ask. Still, the layers of bureaucracy were overwhelming. The need to remain constantly vigilant was exhausting. Trust quickly evaporated. 
   `` `Nobody tells you anything,' Wallace said. 'Nobody prepares you for anything. You're very much on your own in a world you don't know or understand, and you are so overcome with grief and worry that you can't think straight anyway.' '' 
   Well, these and other stories emboldened military families across the country and all Americans to stand up and demand better treatment for our troops and families who have sacrificed so much. 
   As Speaker Pelosi reminds us often, the support provided to our troops by the Bush administration has not matched their sacrifice, and, Mr. Speaker, we will rectify that today. 
   I wish, back in late 2003, when an Army specialist from Tampa named Corey Magee contacted my office, because I was a county commissioner before I was elected to Congress. His family contacted me and said Corey has been shot in the fire fight in Fallujah after an IED blew up his tank. He was shot in the neck and paralyzed and eventually flown to Walter Reed. In some God-given circumstance, I happened to be traveling to Washington that weekend and was able to assemble a care package from his family to deliver to Corey. But they couldn't find out what his situation was. We called and called. We enlisted the help of a United States Senator at the time who was on the Veterans' Committee. We  still couldn't get through the bureaucracy. 
   I had to travel with the Senator's staff to Walter Reed Hospital, and track down the doctor to find out what brave Corey Magee's prognosis was. He was a brave young guy, and really in his condition couldn't ask for help on his own. And do you know, after that he thanked us profusely for contacting his family and filling them in. He said, ``I am sure we won't have to call you again. They are going to take good care of me.'' 
   He returned to Tampa, and I was surprised a few weeks later to get a phone call from this brave Army specialist because he was having trouble getting his physical therapy appointments at the Veterans Hospital.     
   So this bill, though it is a step in the right direction today, comes a bit too late. I wish this bill and I wish the attention had been focused earlier and the respect paid to these families by the Bush administration. 
   As I visited the Bay Pines VA Medical Center in St. Petersburg just a few weeks ago, you see there are a few brave soldiers there who are very symbolic of soldiers across the country that are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   One of the soldiers was in his early 20s, had served in Iraq, come back, trying to get his life together, but it was too much. The mental scars were too much. The post-traumatic stress set in. His young marriage faltered. He lost his job, meaning he eventually lost his home, and ended up as an alcoholic, a homeless alcoholic in his early 20s because of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   What he explained to me was what he needed when he came out of the service was a helping hand. He needed someone proactively to say, are you all right, son, rather than to give him a checklist to check off to make sure he was okay. 
   These are tough guys. They are not going to own up oftentimes to the fact that they cannot sleep at night and they want to drink their sorrows and memories away. 
   Fortunately, I think the American people can be very heartened today to know that this is a bipartisan effort. Under the leadership of our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, I am very fortunate to serve on the Armed Services Committee under the leadership of Chairman IKE SKELTON, and I salute him and the ranking member for moving this legislation quickly. We salute the Veterans' Affairs Committee and Chairman BOB FILNER but, mostly, the leadership of the American people who have cried out for change. 
   Through this rule and this bill, we are going to improve the health care and mental health for our wounded warriors. We are going to tackle the bureaucracy on their behalf. We are going to establish a toll-free hotline so that families and soldiers and anyone who cares about them can report deficiencies in our system. We are going to require expedited action. 
   Thanks to the leadership of subcommittee Chair VIC SNYDER, now Members of Congress that have desired information about the soldiers returning to their districts are going to be notified. Members of Congress oftentimes can be the best advocates for these returning soldiers, and now it will be a requirement in the law. 
   We are going to provide medical advocates to these soldiers. We are going to improve support services to families; and, rather than mismanage resources, we are going to turn the White House's privatization initiative around and require accountability. 
   Coming from Tampa, the home of the Haley VA Center and one of the four polytrauma centers in the country, I am especially heartened by the provisions in this bill that improve veterans health care by providing more physician residents in those polytrauma centers. ABC's News anchor, Bob Woodruff, brought this to life in his hour-long expose a few weeks ago. He visited the Haley Polytrauma Center in Tampa. These are where the most critically injured soldiers are sent for their health care, the brain injuries, the spinal cord injuries. 
   What Dr. Robert Scott, the medical director at that medical facility, told me a few weeks ago is, even though the polytrauma center is directly across the street from the University of South Florida College of Medicine, they cannot get the physician residents in training. The Feds are not providing enough. We need these doctors in training to learn and train about these critical war injuries and the physical therapy that our soldiers need. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge this new Congress to chart a new direction today and to erase the moral stain on our Nation's conscience. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, 4 years after the start of the war in Iraq, and less than 100 days since the swearing in of this new Congress, this Congress will act today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and this legislation so we can pass the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. Let's send a message, let's stand up for our brave troops in the field, not just when they are serving on the battlefield, but when they return home. Let's give the families the respect they deserve and make sure that we are providing superior health care whether it's a physical injury or a mental scar. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment. My amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security to work with the State of Florida and other States, if necessary, to resolve the differences between the Federal Transportation Worker Identification Credential, known as the TWIC, and Florida's existing access control card. 
   You see, shortly after 9/11, the State of Florida enacted a law requiring a centralized biometric credential for workers in deepwater ports in the State of Florida, including the three ports in my district in the Tampa Bay area. 
   This credential is known as the Florida Uniform Port Access Credential, or FUPAC. At the port of Tampa, we have credentialed over 39,000 port workers and the State of Florida has credentialed over 100,000 port workers throughout the State. This means that the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have conducted extensive background checks. 
   Meanwhile, the Federal TWIC, which was first mandated in the Maritime Transportation Security Act, was not finalized by the Department of Homeland Security until just a few months ago. 
   The criteria in the FUPAC and the TWIC greatly duplicate each other. The Federal Government and the State of Florida must reconcile these credentials to ensure that our resources go to make our neighbors and our ports safe rather than satisfy bureaucratic red tape. 
   The Florida Ports Council says that this issue and its resolution will have a profound effect on both the viability of our maritime businesses and the security of Florida's ports. 
   As long as proper security requirements are being met, as they are with Florida's port credential, we need to spare the working folks who keep our ports moving from having to bear the burden and expense of undergoing unnecessarily duplicative background checks. 
   The amendment offered today requires that the Department of Homeland Security work with the State of Florida to resolve inconsistencies and avoid unnecessary duplication between the TWIC and the FUPAC. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which will aid Florida's strong maritime economy and ensure that valuable resources go to keeping our neighbors and our ports safe rather than to unnecessary bureaucratic red tape. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act today to require the Bush administration to negotiate prescription drug prices under Medicare part D so that we can achieve savings for our seniors and for all Americans. 
   In my district in the Tampa Bay area, one in seven residents is dependent upon Medicare for their health care needs. And over the past year, assisted seniors were struggling with the complicated and confusing part D. They do not like being forced into HMOs. Many were frustrated in Florida from having to choose from 43 different HMO plans. And then they did not receive straightforward assistance from the Bush administration. 
   I thank the chairman for his pledge to fight for greater reforms, but today is our first step. 
   It is unfair that HMOs and drug companies are making huge profits off the backs of our seniors. In the last Congress, part D was crafted to benefit the HMOs and insurance companies and not our seniors. But the Democrats know how to fix this. 
   A recent Family USA study found that for the most prescribed drugs, VA prices are much lower than the prices charged by insurers. 
   So let's act today and prove to our older neighbors and all taxpayers that we heard their pleas for help.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4137, COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 and this rule because we are committed to making the cost of attending college more affordable and accessible. This is great news for hardworking, middle-class families and students across America and students in my hometown, which is a college town with thousands and thousands of students enrolled in the community college and at the University of South Florida. 
   There's great debate in Washington today over the economy and how we are going to provide relief to middle-class families. One of the answers is to address the soaring costs of attending college and keep the doors to a higher education open by making college affordable through grants and low-rate loans. 
   A college diploma is a critical step toward a higher paying job and success in life, and one of the best investments we can make for the future of our great Nation is to ensure that the doors to our colleges and universities remain wide open. 
   In my home State of Florida, unfortunately, we're undergoing a budget crisis, and the funding for higher education unfortunately has been targeted for millions and millions of dollars of cuts. This has resulted in the university and community college doors being kept shut for many students. 
   One student in my hometown in Tampa from Jefferson High School, Gabby Rodriguez, has a 4.3 grade point average, but because of the budget cuts in the State of Florida and the lack of student financial assistance, she may have to go to college out of State or put her college dreams on hold entirely. 
   So the passage of this crucial bill could not come at a better time. With passage of this bill, we will increase need-based aid and make the Federal Pell Grants more available to students.     
   You know, last year the Congress battled the Bush administration over the ability of first-generation students to attend college and work through the Upward Bound initiative. Well, we are focused on better jobs for the future, so we will strengthen the Upward Bound program through this bill today. We are focused on better jobs for the future, so we will provide loan forgiveness for graduates who decide to enter public service careers in areas of national need, such as early childhood educators, child welfare workers, and firefighters. We are focused on better jobs for the future, so we encourage students' interest in math, science, and technology through this bill. 
   Through the leadership of Chairman George Miller, who is a hero for college students throughout America, Congressman John Tierney, Ranking Member McKeon, Bobby Scott, Lynn Woolsey, all of the members of the Education and Labor Committee, I salute them and thank them for their leadership because, Mr. Speaker, this is an important bipartisan milestone for education. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act under this rule, and urge my colleagues to pass it today, because in this summer of 2007, in the fifth year of the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq, it is imperative that we chart a new direction for our national security and be more strategic in the defense of America. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, it is clear to me that the reckless White House policy and now the escalation of the war is undermining our country's readiness and ability to respond to other global  threats to our national security. Indeed, in testimony before our committee, top commanders have testified that America runs a strategic risk by staying on the same course in Iraq. 
   The generals confirm that because our personnel and equipment are tied up in Iraq, our ability to handle future threats and contingencies is reduced. In my State of Florida, for example, the National Guard does not have all of the equipment it needs to train and deploy soldiers. They are only 28 percent equipped. In effect, President Bush's war in Iraq is impairing our country's ability to prepare for any other threat to our national security. 
   Florida also feels the pinch of multiple deployments because, time and again, our brave men and women are being asked to go back, to leave their families, leave their jobs, return to the field of battle after inadequate rest at home. Florida currently has the second highest number of troops out of the 50 States deployed in Iraq, over 23,000. And 172 Floridians have been killed and over 1,200 have been wounded since military operations began there over 4 years ago. Hardly a week goes by that my office is not contacted and informed of another sad but heroic death in this cause. In fact, last week, two more Tampa Bay area brave, heroic soldiers were killed by IEDs. 
   People ask me, why are our young American men and women refereeing the ongoing Shiite-Sunni civil war? American troops cannot resolve the Iraqi sectarian and religious conflict; only Iraqis can find the political resolution required to stabilize Iraq. America has now spent over $450 billion in Iraq. When will the Iraqi government take responsibility for the future of their country? 
   President Bush's war in Iraq has been very costly. Over $10 billion a month now, costly not just in terms of degradation of our Nation's readiness, the waste and fraud due to the lack of oversight, but President Bush is sacrificing the health care of our children and our seniors and investments in our towns and neighborhoods while continuing this war without end. 
   So after 4 years of war and over 3,500 American lives, and the Bush-Cheney failure to aggressively pursue a political solution, we demand a new direction and a comprehensive strategy for our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1851, SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 534 provides for consideration of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. 
   The rule makes in order the Financial Services substitute as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. 
   The rule also makes in order six amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. Each amendment is debatable for 10 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, many American families are facing a critical housing crunch. The cost of an apartment or home is rising out of sight. But there is good news from a majority of this Congress that keeps fighting for a new direction for America. The reform provided today through H.R. 1851, under this rule, which has bipartisan support, will help families in need of affordable housing. 
   I would like to thank Housing and Community Development Subcommittee Chair MAXINE WATERS, and Financial Services Chair BARNEY FRANK for their leadership in housing and commitment to our Nation's families. 
   Our actions today are needed because, over the past few years, the Bush administration has caused great frustration when it comes to housing. The White House eliminated housing opportunities for approximately 150,000 families under a major section 8 funding formula change. 
   The White House refused to release about $1.4 billion in unused voucher funds for affordable housing. So, Mr. Speaker, instead of homes for many families in need, thousands of families have been placed on waiting lists. 
   In my hometown of Tampa, Florida, during a 1-week open enrollment session, more than 10,000 seniors, families and veterans indicated a need for housing. But, instead of receiving housing, they were placed on a waiting list. The waiting list takes up to 4 years, and is so long that the Tampa Housing Authority is unable to help others that need it. 
   Even with this reform bill, Mr. Speaker, the final fair market value rents are in need of adjustment. It's ridiculous and completely unreasonable for HUD to believe that a 3-bedroom apartment in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area is available for just over $1,000. The truth is, those affordable homes and apartments are few and far between, and this must be fixed. 
   Nevertheless, H.R. 1851 takes positive steps to ensure that more families are able to find a clean, safe, stable and affordable place to live. Through the major reforms contained in the bill, we are going to increase the number of families that can receive housing over the next 5 years. 
   We will simplify the rules and procedures used to establish rents for section 8 and provide housing. We're going to reduce the bureaucracy and red tape for our public housing authorities so they can concentrate on assisting the elderly, the physically challenged and other struggling families. 
   We're going to provide incentives for families to become more self-sufficient by obtaining employment, increasing their incomes, pursuing higher education and planning for retirement. These families will also be able to use section 8 vouchers for a down payment on the American dream of home ownership. We will continue to fight to keep families safe and protected in an affordable, clean and safe home. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to support this bill. And the Congress should be eager to pass this reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 days Republicans who support the President's troop escalation plan have had two main message points. The first is that the resolution opposing the President's plan is nonbinding and meaningless, and the second is that the resolution will be the ``end of civilization,'' to borrow a term from a columnist. They cannot have it both ways. 
   What we are doing over these 3 days of debate is having a real discussion about changing the course of the war in Iraq. For those who support the Bush-Cheney escalation, this debate serves as a prime opportunity to explain why they think this escalation will work when four other surges have not worked. 
   It is a shame that some have ignored the merits of the resolution and focused on political calculation. In fact, several Republicans sent out a letter saying this debate should not even be about the Iraq war today. If we let Democrats force us into a debate on the surge or the current situation in Iraq, we lose. 
   Far from it, Mr. Speaker. No one will lose by having a debate. In fact, our great democracy benefits and the American people win by knowing that we are charting a new direction.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENTS TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3221, HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1363 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. The rule makes in order a motion by the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services to concur in the Senate amendment, with the text of the House amendment printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   The rule provides 2 hours of debate on the motion, with 80 minutes controlled by the Committee on Financial Services, and 40 minutes controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act and this rule. Our landmark legislation today throws a lifeline to families who are struggling to maintain the American dream of home ownership during this housing crisis and the economic downturn. 
   Families across America are being forced to make heart-wrenching decisions in order to stay in their homes. What will they pay for in this day and age, with rising gas prices, property insurance rates escalating, the cost of health care rising? But nothing is more fundamental than having a safe and clean home for your family. 
   The good news is that many of us in the Congress understand, and we are going to stand up for families and ensure that if you work hard and you play by the rules, the tools and resources will be made available to you to help you stay in your home. 
   The American people have a number of champions here in Congress that understand the importance of a safe, clean and affordable home. Chairman Barney Frank has spent countless hours in providing the tools necessary for families across this country to have a safe, affordable place to live. 
   Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California has spent a great part of her career dedicated to affordable housing for American families. 
   Speaker Pelosi and the Chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Louise Slaughter, are champions of American families and affordable housing as well. 
   Madam Speaker, today three million to four million families are expected to lose their homes to foreclosure. And when a home in your neighborhood ends up in foreclosure it affects everyone. It is usually sold at a reduced rate, and the values of homes throughout the neighborhood are affected. We have all seen these eyesores with overgrown grass, broken windows and in disrepair. 
   Well, that is why we are all in this together. It is vital that we fight to maintain the property values of our communities. 
   Madam Speaker, just a few weeks ago I had my first foreclosure workshop to get families together with lenders to try to get to a point where they could work out their loans. We were very surprised. We had over 600 individuals show up who were either in foreclosure, had fallen a month or two behind, or could see on the horizon, because of an adjustable rate loan or some family circumstance like the loss of a job or the kids going off to college, that they needed a little bit of help. 
   Well, we have been very active in this Congress because while this is a problem that, yes, critically affects a State like Florida, in the Tampa Bay area that I have the privilege to represent, and it affects California desperately, Ohio, Nevada, no part of the country has been immune from the sub prime lending crisis. 
   Fortunately, this American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act comes at an important time. But, you know, this Congress has been working on this for over a year and a half. So many of the initiatives contained in this package have been passed by the House of Representatives. This ``New Direction Congress'' has worked, in a bipartisan way, to pass most of the initiatives that are contained in the act today. 
   Families should know that H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, was passed and did become law at the end of last year; passed by a margin of 386-27 here in the House. It provides that over the next 3 years, families who have had to sell their homes in foreclosure will be spared from getting hit by a larger tax bill, in addition to the pain of losing their homes. 
   There are a number of other critical components in the Housing Rescue Package that were previously passed by the House. And I would like everyone to note, because we will probably hear a great deal of debate here today on the housing package. Everyone should note that almost all the initiatives contained in the bill today were passed over the last year and a half by wide, bipartisan margins. 
   First, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act. That was approved in May by a vote of 239-188. It provides grants to the States and local governments to purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties and turn them into safe, affordable places for folks to live. 
   And I would like to recognize and thank the White House for removing its veto threat. It had threatened to veto this entire package that had been negotiated with the White House over this small section that provides important tools to our State and local governments to tackle those properties that are up for foreclosure, the ones that are overgrown, that have the broken windows, allows them to go in and purchase those properties and turn them into affordable housing for families who are in need. 
   The package also includes the important provisions of the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act that we passed in May of 2007 by a vote of 313-104. This is vital legislation today because it establishes new and extensive oversight and regulatory authority over the Federal National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac. 
   To protect the taxpayers, we are instituting new requirements for the safety and soundness of the portfolio operations of these regulated entities. We need to make sure that we have oversight on the effects of the financial and housing finance markets of all these alternatives and provide an alternative to the current secondary market system for housing finance. 
   Madam Speaker, last September we also passed an important part of this package, the Expanding Home Ownership Act of 2007, by a margin of 348-72 here in the House. This is a critical piece because it expands access to the middle class to the low interest, low fee loans provided by the Federal Housing Administration. These FHA loans are a much better option to the sub prime loans. We are going to take a proactive step here to allow families facing foreclosure to qualify for the  low interest, no fee loans offered by the FHA. 
   The housing package today also includes the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007. That was passed here in the House last October by a vote of 264-148. This creates a new, innovative fund that will be used to build more affordable housing for hard working families and families who have lost their homes due to foreclosure. The new trust fund will focus on construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing in our hometowns. It will pool monies to target housing for families with the greatest economic need. 
   And our efforts come at a critical time if we can get this trust fund up and running. See, the Federal money for affordable housing has largely disappeared under the current administration over the past 7 years. 
   In many communities like mine, housing agencies have thousands on the waiting list. In my hometown of Tampa, Florida, during a 1-week open enrollment session, more than 10,000 seniors, veterans and families indicated a need for housing. But instead of receiving housing, they are placed on a waiting list, and the waiting list takes up to 4 years, and it is so long that the Tampa Housing Authority is unable to help others that need it. 
   Madam Speaker, another important part of this housing package is the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. Yes, we passed this here in the House last November by a vote of 291-127. It requires States to license all mortgage professionals and mandate criminal background checks, requires exams and a ban on felons participating in the mortgage loan industry. 
   We all know that the predatory lending was rampant during the sub prime loan run up. And I would like to draw your attention to anyone that would like to examine in depth the details of predatory lenders and how they worked. Go to the MiamiHerald.com Web site and review their series on predatory lending that they have run over the past couple of days. It is outstanding.     
   They reviewed thousands of pages of court documents, State industry reports, internal e-mails, and police reports from 2000 to 2007 and they discovered that over 5,000 people with criminal histories during that time became loan originators, a rate of nearly two a day. Worse, those include over 2,000 who had committed financial crimes such as fraud, money laundering, and grand theft. Too many of our neighbors were outright lied to and steered into unaffordable, exploding adjustable-rate mortgages without being given an option for a fixed rate and are now facing foreclosure which harms their families and all of us in their community. 
   To accompany this extensive package, what has been added that really has not been voted on by the House today is a request by the Treasury Secretary for new standby authority to buy stock or debt in the GSEs if it is determined that an emergency exists. This is something of an insurance policy against broader losses in the housing market that could bubble up. 
   Mr. Speaker, our efforts here today are absolutely necessary. Families across this country are depending on us. It's unfortunate that while the House and the new-direction Congress has been focused on affordable housing over the past year and a half and has passed terrific, substantive legislation, that it's taken a few months to get it enacted and passed in the end. 
   Thanks again to Chairman Barney Frank for headlining our negotiations with the other body and with the White House. And I feel secure that a large bipartisan vote here today will prove that we can stand up and address this housing crisis across this country. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to correct the record here because this House of Representatives has been working in a bipartisan way for almost 2 years now on housing legislation. In fact, in my opening statement, I chronicled the number of bills starting last year that have been passed in this House by substantial bipartisan margins and sent over to the Senate where they waited. To say that there's been no opportunity for amendment or debate, that's wholly inaccurate. 
   Out of this package, it contains at least five or six bills that had committee hearings, extensive hearings, the opportunity for amendment in committee, the opportunity for debate, previous debate, debate on the floor, amendments here on the floor, debate in the Rules Committee. 
   So I think it's important that the record reflect that reality.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act and this rule, as families across America are in the grips of a housing crisis and it demands expeditious action. 
   The President of the United States says it's necessary. The Governors in this great Nation say it's necessary, and I will submit their statements into the Record. 
   Foreclosures are way up, and the options for safe, clean, and affordable housing are down. In my home town of Tampa, Florida, one in 280 homes is in foreclosure. Now, as Rules Committee Chairwoman Slaughter said, we're going to clean up this mess because America's hardworking families are depending on us, but we will also need to follow up and hold those accountable who have created this mess. 
   Now, the House of Representatives over the past 1 1/2 years have passed bills to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, provide resources to local communities to build new, safe and affordable housing, and crack down on predatory lenders. It has all come to fruition here today. 
   Our efforts will keep the American dream of homeownership available to more American families, thanks to the efforts of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Barney Frank and Chairwoman Maxine Waters, and the other champions for America's families who are going to continue to side with them, and our commitment to affordable housing and safe and healthy communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. CASTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2537, BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CASTOR. I thank my good friend and colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, oftentimes there is great irony here in Washington, and here is another example. The House will consider today this rule and the Beach Protection Act. The intent of the Beach Protection Act is to protect America's beautiful coastlines from water pollution. But here is the irony: Big oil interests have filed an amendment that puts our beaches and America's coastlines at risk. Their proposed amendment seeks to open up our beautiful coastlines to offshore drilling of oil and gas. New offshore oil and gas drilling represents a real hazard to our marine environment, especially in my home State of Florida and the Tampa Bay area. 
   The beaches, the coastal environment, marine resources and our billion-dollar tourism industry in Florida should not be sacrificed for a small amount of oil and natural gas because the oil and natural gas that is projected to be recovered if we open up our offshore areas to drilling, it is projected to provide less than 1 month, 1 month supply of oil and gas. 
   In addition, researchers at the Department of Oceanography at the University of South Florida have warned that it would only take 24 hours for an petroleum spill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to sully Florida's panhandle beaches and then sweep through the gulf's powerful loop current, travel through the Florida Keys and contaminate estuaries and beaches from the Everglades to Cape Canaveral. 
   We only have to look back to 2005, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane Wilma ended up resulting in many oil and gas pollutants seriously affecting the beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. The storms caused 124 oil spills into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. During Hurricane Katrina alone, 233,000 gallons of oil were spilled. There was 508,000 gallons of oil spilled during Hurricane Rita. A full year after Hurricane Katrina, BP admitted that a damaged oil well valve in the Gulf of Mexico was still leaking oil. 
   The knee-jerk reaction to take every opportunity, even a bill called the Beach Protection Act, to open up our beautiful coastline to additional oil drilling, especially in hurricane-prone waters like Florida's gulf coast is ridiculous, not just ironic. 
   So let's stay true to the Beach Protection Act, fight water pollution, strengthen our natural resources and our tourism economy and vote down the Peterson amendment today.

   Ms. CASTOR. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Beach Protection Act, and I salute Chairman Oberstar, Chairman Johnson, and Congressman Pallone for their leadership. 
   The intent of the Beach Protection Act is to protect America's beautiful coastlines from water pollution. Yet big oil drilling interests have once again filed an amendment that puts our beaches and America's coastlines at risk. 
   New offshore oil and gas drilling represents a real hazard to the marine environment of the State of Florida, but all across the country, beaches, our coastal environment, our marine resources, the billion dollar tourism industry in Florida should not be sacrificed for a small amount of oil. 
   It would only take 24 hours after a petroleum spill in the eastern gulf for the oil to sully Florida's panhandle beaches. If the spill was swept up in the gulf's powerful loop current, the spill would pollute the Florida Keys, contaminate estuaries and beaches from the Everglades to Cape Canaveral. 
   We only have to look back to 2005 when we had three Category 5 hurricanes, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, that caused massive oil spills and pollutants in the Gulf of Mexico. It destroyed 150 petroleum production platforms in the gulf and damaged 457 pipelines. 
   Drilling off of our beautiful beaches is the energy policy of the past. If President Bush and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly wanted to address high oil prices, you should have voted with the Democratic majority to take the huge tax breaks away from the big oil companies at a time that they are making record profits. 
   We are fighting for a new direction on energy policy, renewable sources of energy. We value our natural environment, and we value the public health of our communities.

   Ms. CASTOR. Mr. Speaker, last week, the new Congress adopted the most significant expansion of veterans health care in the history of the VA. 
   The real-life story of Lt. Sylvia Blackwood highlights why this is so important. Lt. Blackwood began suffering from PTSD after serving two tours of duty in Iraq. She found the strength to check herself into the VA Medical Center here in W ashington. She was suicidal, but instead of receiving immediate treatment, she was directed to a waiting room. When she was finally admitted, she did not receive therapy or relief. 
   According to an in-depth series published by The Washington Post this week, unfortunately, Lt. Blackwood's story is not uncommon. An estimated one-third of all veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental health challenges. 
   America's servicemen and -women deserve the best care possible when they return from war, both for their physical and mental health. That is why this new Congress last week passed the most significant expansion and improvement in veterans health care in the VA's 77-year history. It's important for all Americans to take pride in that action.
