<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to engage in a colloquy. 
   On the travel fairness language included in the bill, there are two provisions which I believe require additional work and which I hope the gentleman will be willing to work on with me as the bill progresses toward conference, the war exception and the impact on existing State laws. 
   The first is the exception allowing denial or limitation of coverage for people traveling to areas under intense armed conflict. The current language uses the term ``ongoing military conflict''; however, this term is not defined in statute or any other legislation. We must make sure the language reflects the most accurate description of the conflict areas in question and not unintentionally include areas that do not rise to the definition of war zone. 
   Secondly, on another point that I want to try to ask for the gentleman's assistance in conference is the issue of how this law will affect the States with similar laws. The current provision is silent on the issue of States with stronger travel fairness laws on the book, States such as Florida, Colorado, and Washington. As representatives of the Federal Government, Congress should not attempt to preempt State laws with Federal legislation when the State law provides greater protection. In other words, the Federal law should act as a floor, not as a ceiling, a base level of protection for the consumer.  
   I would appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work to address these two issues in the conference.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chairman, I rise to support the NASA authorization act and to thank Chairman Gordon and Representative Udall for their leadership and exceptional work on this bill. 
   On May 31, I experienced the thrill of attending the most recent shuttle launch in Cape Canaveral, Florida. As I witnessed the intense brightness of the rockets' afterburners and felt the rumble of the Earth as the shuttle lifted off, I could feel the pride and strength of American innovation and technological leadership. 
   I have to tell you that I was surprised at how emotional I felt watching the shuttle hurtle towards the sky, and my heart really burst with pride in the American spirit and our ability to move forward generation after generation. The continuity of the space program is critical to maintaining this leadership. 
   The space shuttle is scheduled to retire in just 2 years, yet a lack of funding has delayed its replacement until at least 2015. Without adequate funding, not only would we lose jobs, but we would be forced to rely on Russia to access the International Space Station. 
   The economic return on our investment in the space program is far greater than many realize. In fact, NASA's budget accounts for less than six-tenths of 1 percent of the Federal budget, and yet the benefits of space exploration are vital to our daily lives. 
   Our TVs, cell phones and computers, as well as the military and weather forecasters all rely on satellite technology developed through space exploration. 
   Last year, Speaker Pelosi announced ``The Speaker's Innovation Agenda,'' an action plan to keep America as the leader in global science and technology. This agenda includes educating a new generation of innovators and committing to research and development. 
   By supporting NASA today, we are committing to innovate, to create new opportunities and markets, to drive discovery, and to push the boundaries and limitations that are before us. 
   It is vital that we instill this curiosity and drive in the next generation. I know it was instilled in the next generation that I'm raising because my son announced to me after he saw the shuttle launch, he said, ``Mom, I want to be an astronaut.'' 
   And for me, as the National Chair of the Women's High Tech Coalition and co-chair of the Young Women's Task Force, I want to express particular support for the Hodes amendment, which establishes a scholarship program in honor of Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who died in the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster. 
   The scholarships will go to women pursuing degrees in mathematics, science, and engineering, and would further support women seeking careers in fields related to NASA's mission. We really need to expand the young women's and young girls' interest in the science and mathematical fields.  
   As leaders and legislators, we must work to harness the talent, intellect, and entrepreneurial spirit of Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that NASA has the resources to continue to promote American competitiveness.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to be here with my colleagues from the 30-Something Working Group once again. 
   Just to jump off what our good friend Mr. Murphy was talking about, we are in the midst of the ``New Direction Congress.'' Mr. Ryan, Mr. Meek and I spent the last several years on this floor railing about the ``culture of corruption,'' railing against our good friends on the other side of the aisle, whose only interest when they spoke about tax cuts was providing those tax cuts to the wealthiest few in this country. 
   Now, what is amazing about our ability to move this country in a new direction is that we can really focus on those targeted tax cuts that will help the average working family, the regular folks, the people who don't have the ability to just kick back, put their feet up on the desk and live on Easy Street day in and day out. 
   We are talking about people who live paycheck to paycheck. Not poor people who live paycheck to paycheck, but people in middle America, who make sure that all their bills are paid, just like we are trying to do here with our PAYGO provision, but make sure all their bills are paid. But it takes every dollar they have to do it. 
   Then you add to their budget the increased price of gas, which increases the price of food, which impacts everything that regular, everyday working families have to deal with. And we hit them under the Republican-led Congress with an Alternative Minimum Tax, that was never supposed to be directed at them, but ultimately scooped up so many of those hardworking taxpayers. And you know we listened to the garbage rhetoric that is so tired on the other side.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I am glad the gentleman jumped in. It is like either they have a tape recorder that is stuck on rewind, or maybe we are trapped in ``Groundhog Day'' and we don't know it, or maybe they are just tired. 
   We used to be in meetings, and I have sat in many meetings where I have had colleagues and supporters express frustration because they marvel at our Republican friends' ability to come up with these pithy, cute, packaged messages and that ours aren't as cute and pithy and succinct. 
   Well, do you know what? That is because we don't have purely simplistic solutions to complex problems. The American people saw right through the pithy, cute, succinct, tired slogans that the Republicans have been throwing at them year after year and don't believe them anymore. They reached the point where they won't just take what they say when they repeat it over and over again at face value.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, they also talked about earmark reform. They were railing on and on about earmark reform. 
   Who brought earmark reform to Congress? We did. Who brought about the beginning of the end of the war in Iraq, hopelessly mired in a chaotic conflict in another country? If you rewind back to pre-November 7, what was their cute, pithy, succinct little saying? Stay the course. We can't pull out. We can't cut and run. 
   Who is scrambling to make sure they can protect their own political hides now and be supportive of making sure that we can withdraw, but in a responsible fashion? Well, it is they that spend plenty of time talking about that. We are the ones that are bringing about the beginning of the end of this war by putting those votes up on that board and bringing those bills to this floor that they refused to yield on.

Mr. Speaker, when we bring an energy package the week before we leave for the July 4 recess that really begins to make sure that we end our addiction to foreign oil, they will know it was the Democrats. When we make sure we bring about an end to this war in Iraq, they will know it was the Democrats. And they will say repeatedly, ``they'' being the smart American citizens, American voters, they will say to our good friends on the other side of the aisle exactly what they said to them on November 7, after listening over and over to the same tired slogans, ``Talk to the hand. We don't want to hear it anymore. We see through your garbage. And we are voting to make sure we can move this country in a new direction.''

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You stand here and scratch your head and wonder how it is they could allow it to get to this point. There is no logical, rational explanation. The only thing I could come up with is, A, they think we are dealing with Monopoly money here and it is not real money and it is not real debt; or, B, it is not really my personal debt, so it doesn't affect my personal bottom line, so it doesn't matter; or, C, which is the worst, they just didn't care. 
   It just didn't matter. Their rhetoric was of the utmost importance to them. Making sure they could continue to pass tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, the debt be damned, the deficit be damned, none of that mattered to them, as long as they could keep their contributors happy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Murphy, to add insult to injury, the administration, now that they are not in power here, the administration is using its ability through their agencies to try to cram new formulas down the throats of our hospitals so their reimbursement rate is dramatically impacted, dramatically cut, so that they aren't able to serve the people who need the most help. 
   So not only are our seniors getting nailed by not being able to make sure that they have truly the lowest possible prices that they can pay, that we could negotiate on their behalf for prescription drugs, but our hospitals are facing major cuts at the hands of the administration without any input from elected officials, just bureaucrats in the Bush White House's administration. 
   They actually have one proposed formula change that would presume that hospitals are just going to game the system, so they are cutting money out of their budgets, just because. Pretty much just because they think they are going to play with their numbers. Because they are going to make that assumption, they are going to take the money away, rather than prove that they do that and then take the money away. 
   That is accountability? That is like what is that game that you play on the street, Three Card Monte. They are playing Three Card Monte with people's health care. I don't know. Maybe it is because most of the people who run this country in the Bush administration can afford to pay their own medical bills, so maybe it is just they have hired too many people who don't understand what it is like to try to pay the bills every month. Really, it is just beyond baffling.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is people who need to be able tomorrow pay for their gas in their car and who are running businesses who need to pay for the vehicles their employees are operating so they can make sure they can serve their customers so they can stay in business and pay their employees. Those are the people they are not thinking about. 
   I had a press conference a couple of weeks ago with Congressman Klein who also replaced a Member in a district that had not been represented by a Democrat for 26 years. We were out there with some of our small business owners who talked about the impact of gas prices on their bottom line. 
   I have a constituent in Southwest Ranches who runs a repair business. He literally last year employed 24 people, Mr. Ryan, and now employs 14. He directly attributes this to the fact that he can't afford the gas that he needs to be able to run his trucks around to the businesses that want to hire him to do the repair work. That is just unbelievable.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You know, Mr. Murphy, what you and Mr. Ryan just outlined is what Speaker Pelosi always talks about when we are in our Caucus meetings and when I have heard her talk about the direction that she is helping us lead this country, and that is the budget, and by extension the appropriations bills, are an expression of our values. 
   Mr. Ryan, you talked about our colleague on the other side, and I was in the Chamber when you stood up and talked about that. It really is an expression of our values and a stark contrast in the difference between ours and theirs. Their values were expressed in the energy bills that they passed in the 109th Congress, which gave away $14 billion in subsidies to the oil industry, which when we came into the majority we included in our first 100-hour agenda. The first six bills we passed, one of those was repealing those $14 billion in subsidies so we could responsibly use that money to expand alternative energy research. We earmarked that money appropriately and are holding it so that we can make sure we spend it on really ending our addiction to foreign oil. 
   So if you look at the Homeland Security bill, the Military Construction bill, the Energy and Water bill, all of the appropriations bills that we are going through right now, they are an expression of our values. They 
   show these stark and clear differences between the way we choose to take this country, in the direction we choose to take this country, versus the direction that they had us on, which was careening into oblivion.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. These are bills, because it is plural, that truly think about what the needs are of the average person, the person that we have been talking about for this whole hour that has a paycheck come in and has to figure out how they are going to pay all the bills with the money that comes in. 
   The help that we need to give them to do is to make sure not that we put money in their pocket, because like you said, Mr. Ryan, government can't do everything. Government is here to provide assistance when it is needed, when the person doesn't have the ability to deal with the issue on their own.     
   Like the cost of a student loan, like making sure that they earn a minimal amount of money so they can pay their bills and making sure that the government ensures that the domestic homeland security needs are taken care of, that we have an appropriate number of Border Patrol which has been woefully and inadequately funded under the Bush administration. 
   They spend a whole lot of time beating on their chest and saying how important it is that we have a strong Border Patrol. The Bush administration did not fund as many or even ask for as many Border Patrol agents as the Clinton administration did. It is just rampant hypocrisy. That is all I have seen in the 2 1/2 years that I have been here. It is blah, blah, blah. All they do is talk, and it is hollow and empty behind the words. 
   They have the wrong kind of transparency on their side of the aisle, and folks see through it. That is why they are counting on us to make sure that we take care of these things.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We need some more bipartisanship. And the Six in 06 agenda, the Medicare legislation to ensure that we can negotiate for lower drug prices, the repeal of the $14 billion in subsidies, the passage of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, the minimum wage, those bills had an average of 65 Republican votes. We are glad to have the rank and file Members who clearly were stymied and strangled by their leadership in the majority who are willing to do the right thing and come along with us. 
   I wish we could see more of that bipartisanship and wide open eyes on the war in Iraq because we still have a bunch of lemmings who continue to just be willing to walk off the plank and not ask any questions and continue the same mantra. It is really startling. 
   The bills that we put out on this floor to establish a timeline and to establish benchmarks and to ensure that we can begin to turn this conflict over to the Iraq government, maybe we got two Republican votes on those bills. And one we got one Republican vote on it. 
   You know, over the weekend, because we have been waiting, and they all say wait until September. There are 14 who went to the White House and said to the President, you have until September. We are going to hang with you, but in September we better see some results or else. 
   Over the weekend, in my papers we saw commentary from General Petraeus who said, you know, it is not looking like we are going to be able to do any significant draw down or any draw down of troops in September. In fact, we may need to be in Iraq for 10 years. Ten years. 
   Mr. Speaker, my children will be adults in 10 years. My oldest kids are 8. That means we will have spent virtually because what we are going on, 6 years in Iraq now, that means we will have spent my children's entire life in Iraq. Can you imagine. Their entire childhood twisted and mired in another country's conflict that we created for no good reason or at least for a reason that wasn't accurate with an administration who can't admit when they are wrong. There is no bipartisanship there, and let's just make that clear. 
   When, God forbid, when we are still twisted in this war in Iraq next year, we will do our best that we vote to bring those troops home and establish those benchmarks and some accountability. But if we don't have the votes to override a veto with our Republican colleagues, we will still be there next year, and that is what is going to decide the 2008 election. 
   It is not that I hope that happens because I don't. I want to make sure that the troops come home and are reunited with their family, but we will have a Democratic President at that point because the American people are done. Stick a fork in them, done.

What that means is that the people that I serve and that you serve that are veterans who are waiting 7 and 8 months to get their health care taken care of at their local VA hospitals, they're going to get taken care of.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Yes, they seem to believe that the President's drill more and veto policy is the right way to go when it comes to our energy policy. And I'll tell you, as I often call myself, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Ryan, a minivan mom because I have three young kids, I spend most of my time, when I'm home, driving them from diving practice to baseball games to gymnastics, and it consumes quite a bit of gas. So when I'm home and have to go and fill up that gas tank, which I did just last week before I came back to Washington, it cost me $76, Mr. Ryan. 
   And we've done 30-something in the last few weeks, and I think the last time I was here it cost me $62 to fill up my gas tank, the last time we talked about this. And we've gone from $62, I'm at $76. The week before last I was at $72. The week before that, I was at $68 to fill up the tank. I mean, so now we're talking about real money. Seventy-six dollars is what a very small amount of groceries cost. And that's money that is the difference between someone being able to buy the groceries in the supermarket or put gasoline in the tank or make sure that they can take their kids to the doctor and make that copayment for the doctor's appointment. I mean, we have record gas prices now that are hurting, cutting people to the quick. And the Republicans, our good friends on the other side of the aisle, what is their solution? 
   First of all, before we became the majority and began to even put this issue on the front burner, it wasn't an issue for them. The last action that they took, when they were in charge, was to give $14 billion in subsidies to the oil industry, which is the most profitable industry in America. Now, what does that mean? We've heard a lot of us talk about those $14 billion in subsidies. What it means is that the Federal Government gives the oil industry permission, they are allowed to drill for oil on Federal lands and in exchange they are supposed pay royalties to the Federal Government to do that. We forgive those royalties, that's what the $14 billion is. And what we have proposed is, because we want to truly wean ourselves off of our addiction to oil--and not just foreign oil, we need to wean ourselves off of our addiction to oil period because oil is a finite resource. We need to really invest in renewable energy sources, in biofuels. 
   And what we would like to do is repeal that $14 billion in subsidies, require the oil industry to pay the royalties--because they're pulling oil out of the ground on land that they don't own, on land that is owned by the Federal Government, they're profiting from that and paying nothing for the privilege--we want to take that $14 billion in subsidies and invest it in alternative energy research. Because, you know, growing up, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Ryan, I remember during the Carter administration, I remember the energy crisis. I remember sitting in the back seat of my parents' car on gas lines. And I remember in elementary school seeing all the conservation efforts that they started doing all the way down to, you know, to the public school and elementary school level. We had signs next to the light switches that suddenly were put on there that said, you know, ``turn the lights off.'' There was a big national energy conservation effort that just fizzled once Ronald Reagan became President. And we never invested in alternative research like we should have. The conservation efforts went by the wayside, and we went back to the same old story, oil, oil, oil. 
   And look, right now, the Republicans are talking about needing to drill for more oil in ANWR, pulling oil out of shale, this 68 million acres available now that they are not drilling on, 68 million; I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. They need to be utilizing the turf that they've got now, and they're not. 
   So we need to make sure that it's clear to the American people--and that's why we come out here every night--who's for solving this energy crisis and who's all talk. And I think the Republicans have clearly proven that through their actions and their lack of stewardship when they were in charge. And I yield to the gentleman.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. 
   By the way, to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, that was a very impressive top-of-mind overview, and your command of the facts is truly incredible. So thank you very much for that very articulate overview. 
   We also want to stress that, in addition to laying out the problem and the shock that we have in reaction to the solution of our good friends on the other side of the aisle to drill and veto, we have not stood idly by and just said, ``Well, unless we repeal these $14 billion in subsidies, then we're not going to be able to do anything.'' We have a series of bills that we have passed, and I think it would be helpful for us to go through those and to tell people the efforts that we're making--some short-term, some long-term. 
   This is a difficult problem to solve in the short term. It is very difficult to dramatically bring down gas prices through legislation in a short-term way, but one of the things that we did was to pass the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act. 
   What that does is it says to the President that he is not to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and that was something that the President had previously opposed. He was threatening to veto it until he realized that the increase in gas prices was so politically painful for both his administration and for his Members of Congress that he had no other choice but to finally relent and agree to sign it. There were still 25 Republicans who voted against that bill. 
   What the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Act is designed to do is to bring gas prices down in the short term. During the rest of this year, we expect that bill to affect gas prices in the short term. 
   We have the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. That is a bill that will extend and expand tax incentives for renewable energy, the type of energy that we would like to go in the direction of, instead of the finite sources that the Republicans always talk about. 
   What that bill would do is generate hundreds of thousands of green jobs, spur American innovation and business investment, and cut taxes for millions of Americans. What the provisions of that bill will do is preserve hundreds of thousands of good-paying, green-collar American jobs. 
   A recent study showed that allowing the renewable energy incentives to expire would lead to about 116,000 jobs being lost in the wind and solar industries alone through the end of next year. Yet 159 Republicans voted against that legislation. That's how latched to the oil industry they are. 
   How about the OPEC and Big Oil companies accountability bill? We passed a bill that would combat record gas prices by authorizing lawsuits against oil cartel members for oil price-fixing as well as created an antitrust task force to crack down on oil companies that are engaged in anticompetitive behavior and market manipulation.     
   You still had 84 Republicans vote against that bill. 
   We also passed legislation, historic legislation, Mr. Murphy, for the first time in 35 years we have passed legislation that will require the automobile manufacturing industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. That is the first congressional increase in more than three decades. Ninety-six Republicans voted against that legislation. It was signed into law on December 19, 2007, so we will over the long term see fuel efficiency standards improve, which, of course the automobile industry could have done years and years ago on their own. But, unfortunately, we had to cajole them along a little bit. 
   There are two more bills I want to highlight, simply because of the shockingly large number of Republicans that voted against those as well. 
   You have the Renewable Energy and Conservation Tax Act. That is the bill that included the repeal of this $14 billion in subsidies. It also would invest in clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency and also address a reduction in global warming. It included provisions that would generate, again, hundreds of thousands of green jobs by investing in solar energy and biodiesel jobs and protect an additional 75,000 wind industry jobs. And 174 Republicans voted against that bill. 
   Lastly, one of the things that we wanted to make sure we protected against when it came to our energy policy was price gouging, so we passed the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act, because it is a little bit suspect that all of these retail establishments and all of the entire oil industry suddenly and dramatically all increase prices at the same time. What a coincidence.  
   So we thought it was important in order to provide immediate relief to consumers to give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish people and entities that artificially inflate the price of energy, and we wanted to ensure that the Federal Government had the tools it needed to adequately respond to energy emergencies and prohibit price gouging, particularly like, for example, when you have natural disasters like my State faces which we often struggle with. And 140 Republicans voted against that bill. 
   So it is just really important that we highlight these stark differences in our policy versus the Republicans, what we support and the actions that we have taken and what the other side supports. The other side is married to the oil industry, and we would like to move, again, in a new direction, so we can invest in renewable energy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Murphy, I might need a little help with this so I can be bipartisan. Let's spread this out here. It is always better in the 30-Something Working Group when we give visual examples of what we are talking about. 
   We walked through the agenda of the New Democratic Congress on our initiatives to try to affect the cost of energy in the short-term and the long-term. 
   Here is a visible example. Next to here are the names of the entire Republican leadership, and here are the four major pieces of legislation that we have moved through the Congress. Not allowing OPEC to price fix, making sure that our constituents are not gouged by prices, ensuring that we invest in renewable energy and repealing those $14 billion in subsidies, and ensuring that we have energy security going into the future. 
   There are no yeses on this entire grid, the entire Republican leadership. What is objectionable about making sure that we don't have price gouging when it comes to gasoline? Should we allow OPEC to fix prices? Is that okay? I am just not sure which of these bills was objectionable. 
   It is one thing for them to say that we should do some other things as well, but if we are going to try work in a bipartisan spirit and approach this problem and find a solution together, voting no on anything that doesn't prop up the oil industry is just insensitive and callous and doesn't recognize that this is a real problem that is affecting Americans in a significant way. 
   Thank you, Mr. Murphy. I would be happy to yield back to Mr. Murphy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I just want to address my comments to the remark by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) where he indicated that there is a 7-percent increase in the legislative branch appropriations bill. That is factually inaccurate. 
   If you take into consideration the $50 million rescission that we had in the CR for 2007, we are actually at a 2.4-percent increase. Not taking that $50 million rescission, which came out of the Library of Congress, we are actually at a 4.4-percent increase in this bill. So that is factually inaccurate. I want to make sure that we are dealing with facts. My colleague is incorrect. 
   We have really made an effort, both Mr. Wamp and myself, at being fiscally responsible, recognizing that we are in a difficult fiscal situation and constraining our spending, but at the same time making sure we can focus on life, safety and security needs, and the protection and oversight responsibilities that we need to make sure we can do in this institution.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chairman, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez). 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2771, the legislative branch appropriations bill. I want to thank Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz, Ranking Member Wamp, and the appropriations staff for their hard work in crafting this fiscally responsible bill. 
   The bill on the floor today is ``lean and mean,'' providing just the resources that we need to serve the people in an honest, transparent manner. 
   I strongly believe that as our Nation's elected leaders, we have a responsibility here in the people's House to lead the Nation in creating an environmentally friendly workplace. This is why I crafted two amendments for today's bill that would have directed the Architect of the Capitol to take small but significant steps toward ``greening'' the Capitol complex. 
   I am pleased that Subcommittee Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz shares my support for the Speaker's Greening of the Capitol Initiative. Since she has enthusiastically agreed to consider them during conference, I won't be offering them today. 
   But I would like to draw the House's attention to these two initiatives because they demonstrate how small investments can reap large rewards. 
   Both initiatives were drawn from the Greening of the Capital report recently  completed by the Architect of the Capitol, and both are endorsed by the American Society of Landscape Architects. 
   The first initiative would study the feasibility of constructing a ``green roof'' on the Ford House Office Building. A green roof is a rooftop that is carefully planted with vegetation. It can be anything from a simple plot of grass to a park-like setting. 
   Green roofs have proved to be tremendous economic and environmental benefits. They are great insulators, reducing heating and cooling costs often by as much as 25 percent. And they save on maintenance costs as well since they are more protective than traditional roofs. Green roofs cool the surrounding neighborhood by reducing the amount of heat that is reflected back into the surrounding atmosphere, the so-called urban heat island effect. Vegetation on green roofs celebrates our natural heritage and also absorbs rainwater, reducing contaminated runoff. 
   Even with all these benefits, green roofs have not caught on. They are not very popular yet in the United States. And as Members of Congress, we now have the opportunity to lead by example. A successful demonstration of the economic benefits of green roofs right here in the Capitol Complex can help promote green roofs across the Nation. 
   My second proposal concerns the planting of more trees around parking lots in the Capitol Complex. My colleagues who closely follow environmental issues already know that trees have a remarkable ability to reduce the air temperature in our urban areas. Trees remove carbon from our atmosphere, shade our buildings and cars, and even reduce asthma by filtering out air pollutants. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this proposal would even save the taxpayers money. 
   Without action this year, many of the Speaker's Greening of the Capitol Initiatives, including the two I have just discussed, won't get funding until 2009 or 2010. These proposals would get us started modestly but promptly and don't require additional funds. 
   I look forward to working with Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz to incorporate these projects into the legislative branch's plans for 2008.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I think it's unfortunate that the gentleman from Georgia, the distinguished former chairman of this committee, has chosen this opportunity as a message opportunity, as opposed to working together in a bipartisan way, like the ranking member and I have done, to make sure that we can provide for the safety and security of the facilities of this institution. 
   He knows full well that the Capitol Visitors Center and the employees of the subcontractors that have been engaged to build that facility, while moving entirely too slowly, and we certainly have decried the cost overruns, are required to hire people who legally may work in this country and are required to ensure that a background check and a security check has been done on them. So his remarks are unfortunate, but everybody makes their own choices. 
   In conclusion, Madam Chair, I am really proud of the work that the subcommittee and I have engaged in. We offer this legislation to the House and ask for their support. We have endeavored to make sure that this bill is fiscally responsible, provides for the life, safety and security of the needs of the people who work here as well as the people who visit us here, and make sure that we can engage in Congress's oversight role and provide for accountability for the American people. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Wamp from Tennessee on making sure that we can consistently  provide those initiatives for the American people.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment for a number of reasons. 
   While I support the gentleman, who is from the same generation that I am, in his endeavor to make sure that we can communicate and receive information in an electronic format, the approach that the gentleman is taking is absolutely inappropriate and won't accomplish his goal. 
   We have crafted a tight and fiscally responsible bill. As I outlined in general debate, we have held the bill to a 4.1 percent increase. We actually held it to $276 million below the total request. 
   In their traditional views, the minority agreed. They said that, on balance, the funding provided in this bill to operate the legislative branch agencies is fiscally responsible. This amendment would add to existing shortfalls. It would add to what is already a growing funding shortfall in this account. 
   To be fiscally responsible, we have had to make some tough choices, including funding levels for GPO. The bill already, our colleagues should know, holds congressional printing and binding $62,000 below what was provided in fiscal year 2007. GPO is expecting an $8 million shortfall in this account in fiscal year 2007 in addition to a $3 million shortfall in fiscal year 2006. These shortfalls are due to the flat funding provided to this account since fiscal year 2007, in spite of increasing costs and workloads. These shortfalls will continue in fiscal year 2008. Eventually they are going to have to be paid. 
   This amendment would make that situation even worse. Most of the appropriation for congressional printing and binding goes towards Congress' printing requirements. I want to point out that the gentleman is incorrect when he states that there is a statute. While there is a statutory number in the Code that the GPO is told to print, they only print the number that is requisitioned. In other words, they only print, on a daily basis, the number that they are asked for. We have a deficit in the account that allows them to print the number that is asked for. GPO has no control over those requirements. It's required by law to produce the information. 
   If the gentleman is concerned about the number of printed materials being produced, he should take it up with the authorizing committee, the Joint Committee on Printing, and seek reductions in the amount of material that GPO is required to print in the Code. 
   Simply gratuitously cutting out and leaving people with the impression that we are doing something, when we are not, and all we are doing here is cutting $3.2 million when GPO will still be required to print the Code, is the wrong approach. The suggestion that this amendment was accepted previously but then cut out in conference also leads people to believe that we have done something when we have not. 
   I refuse to be disingenuous when it comes to being forthright with the American people. We do need to make sure that in the future the Congressional Record is produced electronically. This is not the right way to do it. It is irresponsible. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I just want to point out that the amendment offered by Mr. Flake does not say anything about reducing the number of copies printed of the Congressional Record. It simply cuts $3.2 million out of the Congressional Printing and Binding account. It provides no direction. It simply cuts that funding. There is no assumption that any of what the gentleman is suggesting would occur. It would simply further add to the deficit.

If we want to change the statute and go to electronic production of the Congressional Record, that is what we should do.

   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, this is a fiscally responsible bill. Again, we have held the bill to a 4.1 percent increase, only $122 million over actual spending in fiscal year 2007, and if you take into consideration the $50 million rescission in the CR, we are at a 2.3 percent increase. That is $276 million below the total budget request. 
   Again, I want to point to the minority views, where the minority agreed this bill is fiscally responsible. They say, ``On balance, the funding provided in this bill to operate the legislative branch agencies is fiscally responsible.'' 
   This bill funds the must-have's, not the nice-to-have's, by targeting increases towards keeping the agencies running, providing Congress with the tools it needs to perform its oversight responsibility, and funding critical security and life safety projects.  
   The amendment, if adopted, would eliminate $50 million worth of critical health and safety and security projects that we would be unable to fund if a 4 percent across-the-board reduction were adopted. 
   This amendment would eliminate funding for things like the $5 million we have in this bill to ensure that the Capitol Police have interoperable radios. According to the new police chief, a new radio system is their number one priority. The existing radio system is 20 years old. It is antiquated and outdated. It is not encrypted nor secure, and it is not interoperable. Hurricane Katrina showed the importance of interoperable communications during a crisis. 
   It also would eliminate funding potentially monitoring the utility tunnel abatement. We had tunnel workers who were subjected to horrendous conditions and have been exposed to asbestos, and we are endeavoring to make sure that we can make up for that and provide the funding for the abatement. That would be impossible if this amendment were adopted. 
   We provide $1.2 million for escape hoods for our Library visitors, $1 million for emergency exit signs and lighting in the capital, and emergency lighting upgrades in Rayburn. 
   The amendment would also impair our agency's work. It would put the legislative branch agencies back to a fiscal year 2006 funding level since there was no increase in 2007. 
   In practical terms, the impact of this would be less capability on the part of GAO to assist Congress in its oversight responsibilities; fewer and less timely products from CRS to assist Members in their legislative duties, a further reduction in CBO's ability to score Member bills, which was pointed out in the Rules Committee as already being a problem; elimination of the digital talking book conversion program for the blind; a reduced ability for the Office of Compliance to pursue health safety issues around the Capitol complex, even as we get ready to add new space with the approaching opening of the CVC; the Architect's operations would be strained to keep up with increases in utility costs; and, finally, since 77 percent of this bill is labor costs, as is most of the increase, this amendment would surely result in a reduction in our workforce. 
   It is irresponsible. Mr. Wamp and I have endeavored to put forward a bill that is fiscally responsible, fiscally tight, and ensures the life, safety and security needs of the people who work and visit here. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I want to point out and remind my colleagues that Mr. Wamp and I are proud to report to you that we have brought the legislative branch appropriations bill in at $276 million below the request. The easiest thing in the world to do is jump on the table and to cry waste. 
   I want to also point out that this is a security upgrade, funding for security upgrades requested by former Speaker Hastert and continued by Speaker Pelosi so that we can ensure that we provide swing space for our very cramped space so that we can properly renovate the Cannon and Longworth House Office Buildings. 
   I ask my colleagues to come over and look at these pictures of the deterioration of our facilities. These are pictures of the 100-year-old Cannon House Office Building. If you take a look at the deterioration and life, safety and security upgrades that this facility needs, we can no longer wait to make these upgrades, and to make sure that we can protect the people who work here and the people who visit us. They are deteriorating and badly in need of renovation. 
   What the gentleman from Georgia's motion to recommit would do is delay for years, if not make it impossible, for us to begin renovation and repairs on our aging House facilities. 
   My colleagues, this committee does not deal with the sexiest of subjects that confront us every day, and I have only been here for 2 years and the chair of this subcommittee for the last 5 months. You don't earn a reputation as an institutionalist in that short period of time, but it is my hope to be able to do that over time. 
   We are stewards of this great institution, but we are also stewards just as much of these facilities. My colleague on the Appropriations Committee, Jos&#233; Serrano of New York, recently made a wonderful suggestion to remind us of the history embedded even in what may seem mundane, the space we occupy each day. He suggested that we each have plaques in our offices with the names of our predecessors in Congress who occupied that space before us. My own office, I was thrilled to learn, was once occupied by former Congressman Lyndon Johnson. 
   My point is they may seem like buildings and office space to the outside world, but we know better. How many of us countless times have found ourselves approaching this beautiful building we are now in and marveling privately to ourselves, wow, I work here, what an incredible privilege. 
   But with privilege comes responsibility. We must think about the institution, but we must also think about our hard-working staff. The number of hours they toil in these facilities is mind-boggling. You might be surprised to learn that the average work space for each of our staff is about 36 square feet. And I want to show you what 36 square feet is. This is 36 square feet. That is how much space that we allot, on average, to our employees. 
   GSA recommends an average of 100 square feet of space per employee. We need to renovate so that we can make sure we are not cramming our staff into unreasonable boxes for hours on end. Our staff make incredible sacrifices to serve the public, our constituents, and they help us do our job. We must make sure that we keep these facilities, the place they work every day and night, safe for them. We must make sure we keep these facilities safe and in good condition for our constituents and our successors. 
   Mr. Kingston's amendment is well-meaning, but it is not responsible, and it is not an eye toward the future with respect for our past. I strongly urge you to vote against the motion to recommit.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
   Madam Chair and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch appropriations legislation for the fiscal year 2008. 
   The Legislative Branch bill is unique in that it appropriates funding for the entire Capitol Building and Grounds as well as nine legislative branch agencies and the 435 Members of this body and their offices. As a new member of the Appropriations Committee serving as a subcommittee Chair, I recognize the tremendous responsibility that comes along with being steward of this great institution, and I am honored by the confidence and trust that Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, and my colleagues have placed in me. 
   Historically, the Legislative Branch bill has enjoyed the bipartisan spirit that has come to define the Appropriations Committee and my experiences in working with the ranking member have been consistent with that spirit. Over the past several months, I have worked with Ranking Member Wamp, the gentleman from Tennessee, and other members of the committee from both parties to shape and determine the appropriations for the people's House. We held 14 oversight hearings prior to developing this bill, and I am very proud of our accomplishments. 
   I want to thank the members of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for their help and input, Vice Chair Lee, Mr. Udall, Mr. Honda, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Ruppersberger, Mr. Wamp, Mr. LaHood, and Mr. Goode. The vast majority of our committee is new to the full committee, and we approached our task with zeal and with dedication. 
   I would particularly like to thank Ranking Member Wamp for his work on this bill. He has been a good partner, and I appreciate his cooperation and friendship. While we have not agreed on every issue, we worked in partnership to address our differences; and notwithstanding a few issues, they were resolved. I would also like to thank Chairman Obey for his guidance during this process and Ranking Member Lewis for his efforts as well. 
   Madam Chair, the bill provides $3.1 billion for the legislative branch, not including Senate items. That's an increase of $122 million, or just 4 percent, over the actual spending level in fiscal year 2007. This reflects a $276 million reduction in the total amended budget request, and I think that's an important point that Members should note. We are bringing this bill in under the original request. 
   We used three guiding principles to develop this bill: fiscal responsibility, security and life safety, and accountability. 
   In terms of fiscal responsibility, we've emphasized that we need to keep this bill tight with a view towards the long term. We've funded the must-haves over the nice-to-haves and have focused on critical investments. We've held the actual spending increase in this bill to only 4 percent, $122 million, compared to the 13 percent, or $398 million, which was the increase that was requested. 
   In terms of security and life safety, we've made sure this bill makes the Capitol complex as secure and safe as possible. To this end, the bill includes $50 million worth of critical security and life safety projects, including, at the suggestion and urging of my good friend from Tennessee, interoperable radios for the Capitol Police. It also provides substantial increases to agencies with a direct role in the health/safety of the complex. The Capitol Police receive an 8 percent increase, while the Office of Compliance, which ensures that we protect our visitors and our employees in a safe environment, receives a 23 percent increase. 
   Finally, in terms of accountability, we've crafted this bill to provide Congress with the resources it needs to perform its constitutional oversight role and hold agencies accountable. We've fully funded House committees and included resources to bulk up GAO to better support our congressional oversight efforts. We've also beefed up  the Capitol Police IG office and established a statutory IG office at the Architect of the Capitol to improve oversight within those two organizations. 
   In closing, we've kept this bill tight so that we're fiscally responsible. We've done so by prioritizing investments for critical life safety and security needs while providing Congress with the tools it needs to hold the government accountable to the American taxpayer. 
   Madam Chair, we have a wonderful staff. I'd like to thank my committee staff, my personal staff, and Mr. Wamp's staff: Ms. Tracie Pough and Ian Rayder on my personal staff; Mr. Tom Forhan, our clerk; Rob Nabors, the full Appropriations Committee clerk; Chuck Turner; David Marroni; and Mr. Wamp's staff, Jeff Shockey and Liz Dawson, for their assistance. They have assisted both myself and Mr. Wamp as a new Chair and ranking member with our learning curve and worked countless hours to help produce this product. 
   Finally, I want to thank, Madam Chair, my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their guidance, patience, understanding and encouragement as we endeavored to craft a bill that was fiscally responsible with an eye toward ensuring that our employees and visitors have a safe and secure environment in which to function, as well as make sure that Congress has adequate resources to engage in our oversight responsibilities. 
   Madam Chair, it is an honor to serve in this role.     Insert offset folio 85/1 here EH22JN07.001     Insert offset folio 85/2 here EH22JN07.002     Insert offset folio 85/3 here EH22JN07.003     Insert offset folio 85/4 here EH22JN07.004 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Yes, that's correct.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you for yielding, Chairman Davis. Like you, I am very concerned about the Comptroller General's actions and have personally spoken to him to express my concerns. 
   I am committed to doing all we can to ensure that the Comptroller General does not put up obstacles to workers' rights to organize. In particular, I am dismayed the GAO, as a legislative branch agency, has retained outside counsel, rather than use its own attorneys to represent it before the Personnel Appeals Board. This action is unnecessarily costly and will likely delay the process of determining the outcome of the petition. 
   The committee has reiterated these points in report language in this bill. We will be closely monitoring the progress of the Comptroller's review of  eligibility, and we are requiring weekly reports on progress in these areas.

In addition, the disability language, while it is a directive, it was intended to make sure that we could keep the safety and security focus of our legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 505, to highlight the important contribution of the recreational boating community and the boating industry to our way of life, and to call upon the President to issue a proclamation asking the American people to observe National Boating Day. 
   As a Representative of Florida's 20th Congressional District, I can attest to the important contribution recreational boating and the boating industry has had upon South Florida's economy and quality of life. The marine industry is responsible for more than $18 billion of revenues and 220,000 jobs in Florida. 
   Recreational boating is integral to the way of life in Florida. From fishing to snorkeling to scuba driving in our beautiful coral reefs, or simply taking a scenic cruise through Florida's intra-coastal waterways, recreational boating and South Florida go hand in hand. 
   In fact, recreational boating is such an important part of Ft. Lauderdale that the city has earned the well-deserved nickname, the ``Venice of America.'' 
   But the contributions of the recreational boating community go far beyond my home State. The boating population exceeds 73 million individuals utilizing and enjoying an estimated 18 million recreational watercraft. In addition, the recreational boating industry provides more than $39 billion in sales and services to the U.S. economy, and provides nearly 380,000 manufacturing jobs. 
   Boating helps to bring us closer to the wonders of nature, and it helps us to appreciate the need to be goods stewards of our natural resources. 
   It's no surprise that boaters often are some of our most ardent conservationists, because they see firsthand the importance of protecting our fragile ecosystem for generations to come. 
   It's for these reasons that I rise in support of H. Res. 505, recognizing the contributions of the recreational boating community and the boating industry to the continuing prosperity and affluence of the United States. This resolution calls upon the President to issue a proclamation to observe National Boating Day, with an appropriate day being July 1. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 505 and vote for its final passage.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my good friends from Florida, Mr. Keller and Mr. Meek. It is my privilege to join with my colleagues in honoring the life and legacy of the Diaz-Balart family, and particularly Rafael Diaz-Balart, who distinguished himself not just in the Cuban House of Representatives, but by becoming a wonderful citizen of the United States of America and contributing his subsequent generations of his family to the history of the State of Florida and to the United States by lending his two grandsons to the United States House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, across this country we have a wonderful history of naming institutions like law centers after our giants, and Florida is no exception. The Shepard Broad Law Center at Nova Southeastern University is named after a Florida giant. The University of Florida Law Center, the Holland Building, is named after a Florida giant. And now the law center at Florida International University will be named after a Cuban-American, a Florida giant, Rafael Diaz-Balart, and it is my privilege to join my colleagues in honoring his legacy and his life today.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (SALUTING HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA'S PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK AND RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SAFE KIDS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, public service is among the most noble and demanding of professions, and excellence in the delivery of public service helps to keep the city of Hollywood, Florida, strong and prosperous and a wonderful place in which to live and work. 
   The effectiveness and efficiency of government depends, in large measure, on public employees whose task it is to provide, on a daily basis, a broad range of services of the quality required and expected by the public. Quite often the importance of the public service that is rendered by public employees and the exemplary manner of their performance are often forgotten or overlooked. 
   Public employees and volunteers, through their commitment to excellence and diversity of skills, have made great contributions to the City of Hollywood in areas such as public safety; recreational activities; neighborhood revitalization; and the delivery of water, sewer, and solid waste services. 
   The City of Hollywood recognizes the contributions made by public employees as well as volunteers at all levels of city government and finds it fitting to set aside a special time to honor and thank these dedicated individuals who perform such vital roles. 
   Public Service Recognition Week is being celebrated from May 7 through May 13, 2007, and salutes approximately 1,700 City of Hollywood employees who devote their time and talents to public service and who ``do whatever it takes'' to help citizens attain a high quality of life, and the numerous volunteers who contributed approximately 22,632 hours of volunteer service. 
   To provide even better service to the public, the City of Hollywood has committed to an organizational cultural change to enhance customer service and employee involvement and has initiated this process through the employee-guided strategic plan created by Hollywood City Manager Cameron D. Benson, a wonderful man, I might add. 
   With that said, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to the City of  Hollywood, Florida, in its celebration of Public Service Recognition Week. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, additionally, I also rise today to recognize National Safe Kids Week. This is an issue that is near and dear to my heart as a mom with three young children. This year National Safe Kids Week will be held from April 28 through May 6, 2007. That is the week that we are in now. National Safe Kids Week is a joint partnership between Safe Kids Worldwide and its founding sponsor, Johnson & Johnson. This week of public education activities has been held annually for 19 years and draws much-needed attention to accidental childhood injury, a leading killer of children 14 and under. 
   This year's National Safe Kids Weeks' theme is ``Make it a Safe Kids Summer.'' The start of summer is known by emergency personnel as ``trauma season'' since accidental deaths and serious injuries to children increase dramatically. An average of 17 children a day, or 2,143 children in total, died from May to August, 2004, due to injuries, many of which could have been prevented. 
   Safe Kids Worldwide research indicates that five of the most common causes of children's accidental injury deaths in summer are drowning, which increases 89 percent in the summer over the monthly annual average; biking, which increases 45 percent; falls, which increase 21 percent; motor vehicle passenger injuries, which increase 20 percent; pedestrian injuries, which increase 16 percent. 
   In fact, almost 60 percent of total children's accidental injury deaths from May to August from 2001 to 2004 came from these risk areas. Events led by Safe Kids coalitions are taking place in more than 300 communities across the Nation in order to educate parents and families about how to keep kids safe during the summer, especially when participating in these activities. As my home State of Florida, drowning prevention is an important concern of mine as a parent and as a legislator. In fact, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death to children in the summer months in Florida. 
   My most rewarding victory, Mr. Speaker, came from the passage of the Florida Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act. I was honored to sponsor this law as a State legislator, which has helped to save countless numbers of children from accidental injury and drowning in Florida pools. As the majority of drownings and near drownings occur in residential swimming pools and in open water sites, I hope that more States work to address water safety in their communities. 
   Recently I introduced similar Federal legislation here in the House of Representatives. My legislation, the Pool & Spa Safety Act, would provide grants to States that pass such comprehensive safety laws and also support drowning prevention educational programs, among other provisions. Along with my colleague Representative Frank Wolf, we hope this bill will be passed before another ``trauma season'' occurs for our Nation's children. I encourage my colleagues to lend it their support. 
   I also urge my colleagues to support National Safe Kids Week and to work with your State or local Safe Kids coalition to prevent these accidental injuries to children not only in the summer months but throughout the year.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
   I want to thank the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and our entire Democratic leadership for the opportunity for the 30-Something Working Group to once again come to the floor and talk about the priorities of the Democratic Caucus and the new direction for America that we are humbled to be able to lead this country in. 
   On November 7 of last year, the American people spoke loudly and clearly, Mr. Speaker, that it was imperative that we move this Nation in a new direction on a variety of issues, not the least of which is the direction that we are going in in this war in Iraq. And I am so proud today to be able to stand here knowing that the vote that I cast personally and that the 217 other Members that passed that legislation off this floor this afternoon cast so that we can now finally begin to ensure that our troops will have the armor that they need, the armor and equipment that they need, a plan to get them home most importantly, and to ensure that we can begin to transition in Iraq so that the Iraqi people will be able to stand on their own, run their democracy and make sure that they can focus on solving the civil war and the strife that is going on in the midst of their country, because that is essentially what we have been doing for them. What we have been doing for them that we can no longer continue to do is inserting ourselves in the middle of their chaos without plans to be able to withdraw, without a single brigade of their army completely trained to stand on their own. It is time and the American people have insisted that it is time to begin to move in the direction where we can shift the mission from combat to training, where we can focus our troops that will remain there by the end of next year on counterterrorism, on putting down the insurgency and on making sure that the Iraqi troops are well trained so that they can continue to move forward with their experiment in democracy. That is what the legislation that we passed today will do, and I am so proud of our caucus and of our colleagues and of our leadership for the work that we have done together, for the unity that we showed, for the courage that so many of our colleagues showed, Mr. Speaker. We have a very diverse caucus, a very diverse group of Democratic Members who for a variety of reasons, for a variety of soul searching were able to come together from all of the different facets of the philosophical spectrum, to come together today and pass this extremely important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been in public office for 14 years. I have only served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 2 years, but that was one of the most emotional experiences and the most difficult experiences that I know I have gone through. And I cast that vote knowing that I had the support of my constituents, knowing and confident that my constituents want to make sure that we can bring those American troops home. 
   I had an opportunity to travel and spend some time with our troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center a few weeks ago before we voted on the resolution opposing the President's escalation proposal. I have said this the last few times we have talked about this on the floor. I had a chance to speak to a number of different troops individually. One young man who has stayed with me, and I think I've thought about him and his family every single day since then. As a mom with little kids, I have 7-year-old twins and a 3-year-old little girl. Almost every major vote I cast, I cast with them in mind. There is another generation of Americans who we are going to protect from that vote that we cast today. And this young man who I had a chance to meet with, he had just gotten home from his third tour of duty. Each was a year. His third tour and his 6-year-old little boy was in the room along with his wife and his little boy was so excited and just full of vibrancy and life. He shook my hand. It was just so neat to be able to talk to him. He told me that his daddy was finally going to be coming home for good, forever, in August. He had come down with a really inexplicable illness and was convalescing at Walter Reed. And when the young man told me that he had been through his third tour of duty and that his boy was 6, it was not lost on me that he had missed half of his son's life, a 6-year-old little boy with his dad gone for 3 separate years. That is just unacceptable. That is not what the procedures are supposed to require of our men and women in uniform. There is supposed to be at least 365 days of noncombat duty in between tours. The legislation that we passed today will ensure that that will happen. The legislation that we passed today will ensure that our troops have the equipment that they need. It will ensure that $1.7 billion in funding will provide the health care that our veterans need. 
   I listened to a lot of the speeches on the floor, almost all of them, today. What we continually heard from our friends on the other side of the aisle was almost as if maybe they didn't  read the bill, maybe they weren't paying attention, but more likely they were just being political. I heard comments about how our legislation didn't provide the equipment for the troops, when up until now it is this President, with the acknowledgment of the military leadership, that has sent our troops into harm's way without the proper training. We have the least trained, least prepared Army that we have ever had at this point, spread as thin as they possibly could be spread, and then they have the nerve on the other side of the aisle to suggest that it is us that is not providing the protection for our troops. That is ludicrous. I'm not sure whether they're not listening to their constituents when they're home or not having a chance like I did and like I know you have to sit down with troops who have been in the line of duty. Maybe they're listening with different ears or maybe more likely they're listening with a different heart, because the heart that I listened with knows that we can't allow the pointless loss of human life anymore, not for our men and women in uniform and not for the Iraqi people who are also losing their lives in the midst of chaos. If we are going to focus on the war on terror, we should be shifting our approach to the war in Afghanistan, where we provide a significant infusion of funding, badly needed funding so that we can turn Afghanistan back around. 
   If you recall, Mr. Speaker, after the tragedy of 9/11 and we initially went in to respond to that tragedy, to stand up for America, we went into Afghanistan and we got rid of the Taliban and we made sure that we could restore human rights in that country and we could restore the rights of women to go to school and to walk in public without a burqa and to really shine the light of freedom on a country that lived in darkness for decades. Instead, this President and this Republican leadership shifted our focus, lost our purpose, lost their way, or gave up is really a better way to put it, and invaded Iraq under false pretenses, provided this Congress, many of our colleagues who voted ``yes'' relying on the information from this administration that it was out of necessity. This wasn't a war of necessity. This was a war of choice. We don't have the luxury of going into wars of choice, Mr. Speaker, when we have wars of necessity like Afghanistan, when we have a situation like we have in Iran, where we have a leader in that country who has threatened the very existence of the State of Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, where we have nations in the Middle East who truly want to see democracy fail. Instead, we have created an incubator for terrorism in Iraq. 
   I heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle speak today about how we were going to lose the war on terror if we passed this legislation today. Well, the administration has made the war on terror worse, has made the likelihood of being attacked greater by creating the cesspool that exists in that nation. We must take the steps that the legislation that I proudly supported and that you proudly supported today, that that legislation will do so that we can put some benchmarks in place, so that we can make sure, just like the President said on January 10, so that we can establish some benchmarks, make sure that the Iraqi leadership meets those benchmarks, and if they don't, then the blank check and the open-ended commitment to this pointless war will end. That is the direction that we are now moving in. 
   I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and neighbor from the State of Florida, my colleague, Mr. Kendrick Meek.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I wanted to take off on the point you just made about the ability we give for the President to make a decision that he thinks is in the national interest, of national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides benchmarks, the same benchmarks that this President came before the country and said were essential on January 10; that we have unit readiness; that we have a length of deployment. 
   We have two sets of benchmarks here. We have benchmarks that this Democratic Congress put in this legislation to make sure we can protect our troops, to make sure we weren't sending them into harm's way unprepared. Then we have benchmarks in this bill to ensure that the Iraqis meet their obligations. Those obligations, those benchmarks, are the same ones that the President indicated to the American people were essential when he spoke to the Nation on January 10. 
   When this Congress switched from Republican to Democrat after November 7, the main reason it happened is because the American people were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They had lost their confidence in their government. Their confidence in this Congress was badly shaken. We had scandals. We had a culture of corruption. We had a situation where the American people couldn't believe that their Congress was doing right on their behalf, and that the majority, Republican at the time, was here for the right reasons. That is why there was a wholesale shift and we won 33 seats on November 7. 
   We are exercising Congress's appropriate oversight role and reasserting the system of checks and balances that the Founding Fathers envisioned, particularly by putting language in this bill that ensures that units have to be ready. They have to be prepared. The chief of the military department concerned has to determine that a unit is fully mission capable before it is deployed to Iraq. 
   The reason that I wanted to interject during Mr. Meek's remarks is because you, Mr. Meek, mentioned that the President can certify to the Congress that sending a unit into harm's way in Iraq in spite of the fact that they are not fully mission capable would be in the national interest. 
   He is the commander-in-chief. There is no question that the President is the commander-in-chief. But it is our responsibility as Members of Congress that we look out for the American people, specifically and especially in this case our men and women in uniform who are going over to defend this country. We provide the funding to send them over. We provide the funding to ensure that they are fully equipped and prepared. And the President should have to come back to us and say in spite of the fact that this unit, these women and men are going over there unprepared and aren't fully mission capable, it still is in the national interest to send them. That is the least that he can do. 
   He can maintain his role as commander-in-chief in this legislation, but he has to make sure that he is doing right by our troops, and he has to own  up to what he is doing in this legislation, including in their length of deployment. 
   There is a Defense Department policy, Mr. Speaker, that requires the Department of Defense to abide by its current policy, which is that you shouldn't deploy a unit to Iraq or any region more than 365 days for the Army and more than 210 days for the Marines. The President in this legislation can waive that provision too, but he has to say that it is in the national interest to do so, to send troops on another tour with less than a year's rest, less than 210 days in the case of Marines. 
   Again, he has to actually say to that young man, whose 6-year-old boy I met, it is okay to miss half your son's life, because we need you, it is in the national interest, instead of being able to sort of duck and cover and do it in a clandestine way without the American people really knowing and without him owning up to it. 
   The same with time between deployments. It requires the Defense Department, besides length of deployment, the time between deployment is essential as well. The President can waive that provision, but he has to say to the Congress that it is in the national interests to do so. 
   We also have benchmarks related to the Iraqi people as well. By July 1, 2007, the President has to certify that Iraq is making meaningful and substantial progress in meeting political and military benchmarks, including a militia disarmament program and a plan that equitably shares oil revenues among all Iraqis. After all, they are in the midst of civil war. They are killing each other over things like that. 
   The President has to certify there is progress being made. Otherwise, we are going to be there forever, with no end in sight, with no pressure on the Iraqi leadership to get the job done. Why would they feel the need to move in the direction of progress if they know that there is a never-ending, open-ended commitment for us to be there and for the money to keep flowing.     
   They also have to achieve political and military benchmarks. By October 1, 2007, the President has to certify that Iraqis have achieved political and military benchmarks, and if he doesn't provide that certification, then U.S. forces will begin immediate deployment completed by March 2008. There are steps toward progress that the Iraqi leadership must take or we are not going to continue to put our men and women in harm's way, and we shouldn't. 
   And, finally, we need to eventually end our participation in this war. Our commitment there should be finite, not open-ended. The President should not have a blank check, and this legislation that we passed today ensures that. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You know, there are students of history, our esteemed Speaker in the Chair is a former college professor, and he certainly knows that the origin of this country was one where our Founding Fathers and the people that came before them that colonized this nation were escaping from tyranny, essentially, were escaping so that they could be free, so that they could be free from one individual telling them how their lives would be run, so they could be free from persecution about their religious choices that they made, so they could be free from taxation without representation, so that they could be free. And the reason that our democracy was set up as it is, with a Commander in Chief, with an executive as well as a legislative and judicial branch, was so that there would be a system of checks and balances. 
   I am baffled by our friends on the other side of the aisle when they seem to be saying that the Congress weighing in with binding legislation, with benchmarks, and with a time line so that we can ensure that there is not a never-ending commitment and a blank check being written to folks fighting a civil war in another country, our friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be saying that we should only care about the opinion of one person, the person in the White House, that the decisions that the executive of this Nation makes are the only ones that matter. 
   Well, if you go back to the origin of this Nation, Mr. Meek, you go back to the origin of this Nation, that is why our power was diffused. That is why our Founding Fathers created three branches of government, because they experienced the tyranny of one individual. They had decisions forced on them by a king, by a monarch, who told them exactly what was going to happen. And there was no place to turn, there was nowhere to go. Well, the American people and our men and women in uniform can turn to us because they have a Congress, they have a representative body that can rescue them when the executive makes the wrong decision, and that is what has happened here. 
   That is also what has happened with our veterans, Mr. Meek, because it is incredibly important that we emphasize that, while we have made some very important, significant and essential decisions about the direction that we are going to continue to go in this war in Iraq, we also made some significant decisions to help our veterans, the ones that have already fought and have come back and have been left behind, have been forgotten, the ones that this administration and the Republican leadership before us had callous disregard for. 
   And we are always about third-party validation in the 30-Something Working Group, so people just shouldn't take it from me or take it from you. Let's just walk through what happened before and what has happened leading up to today with the vote that we cast on this floor. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, before I got here, Mr. Meek, you were here, but before I got here, this is right when you got here, in January 2003, the Bush administration cut off veterans health care for 164,000 veterans. That is right in the Federal Register. It is documented on January 17, 2003. 
   In March of 2003, the Republican budget, crafted then by this Republican Congress at the time, cut $14 billion from veterans health care that was passed by the Congress with 199 Democrats voting against it. 
   In March of 2004, the Republican budget shortchanged veterans health care by $1.5 billion, and that was passed by a Congress with 201 Democrats voting against it. 
   Fast forward to March of 2005. President Bush shortchanged veterans health care by more than $2 billion in 2005 and cut veterans health care by $14 billion over 5 years, and that had 201 Democrats voting against it. 
   But that is not all. Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2005, after Democratic pressure, the Bush administration finally acknowledged, when I got here, Mr. Speaker, the Republican administration was denying, Mr. Meek, you remember this, they were denying there was a shortfall in the Veterans Administration budget, repeatedly denying it. There were articles about the dispute. The Veterans Administration insisted there wasn't a problem; but finally in the summer of 2005, after constant pressure from the Democrats in the minority, they finally had to acknowledge that the fiscal 2006 shortfall in veterans health care totaled $2.7 billion. We had to fight all summer to fix that.     
   We had to do an emergency supplemental during that summer to make sure that we could fund that shortfall. 
   I remember when we were doing the 30-Something Working Group during that time, I remember Mr. Meek put the picture of the Secretary of the Department of the Veterans Administration up on that table there because what seemed important to the Secretary of the VA at the time was that his picture be hanging in every building run by the VA, and he was all the while denying there was a shortfall in his budget, and he couldn't adequately provide for the veterans under his care; but he was going to make darn sure his picture was hanging in every building. 
   In March of 2006, President Bush's budget cut veterans' funding by $6 billion over 5 years, and that was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress. 
   Finally, after November 7, 2006, and the American people voted for a new direction, the Democratic Congress increased the veterans' health care budget by $3.6 billion in the joint funding resolution. And in the supplemental legislation we passed, we provide an additional $1.7 billion to fund veterans' health care and to address the significant problems we have at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which were also denied and not acknowledged until the Washington Post exposed the travesty. We have since had heads roll, the Secretary of the Army, the general that headed up Walter Reed and numerous  others. The only reason we had accountability there, finally, is because we have a check and balance. We have oversight and hearings going on. Congress is asking questions. We are not allowing one person to make all of the decisions and impose them on the people that he represents. Finally.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We have locked elbows for 12 years, Mr. Meek, worked together and fought together. As we close, I was thinking as you were closing that you and I, we were born 3 weeks apart. The Vietnam war, when the Vietnam war was ending, we were less than 10 years old. We were little kids. I don't remember much about how the Vietnam War closed out, but that was the beginning part of the history lessons that we had in public school. 
   I remember learning about, and I have read articles and read textbooks and studied for exams learning about what happened to our men and women in uniform when they came back from that war. As they came back, they were spat upon and disrespected and unappreciated. We see sadly the results of that with so many of the homeless and mentally disabled veterans that scatter on our Mall and who stand up for the rights of veterans. 
   I have to tell you, I am also proud of the American people because as we grew up, and as we spent the balance of our lives until this point without there being war, that is not how our troops are treated any longer. The American people grew, and they learned, and that is what I am incredibly proud of. 
   I am proud that our colleagues today did two things that are important: We used our heads, and we listened with our hearts, and we will be able to bring our men and women in uniform home from this war. Until then, we will make sure that they have the funding that they need, the equipment that they deserve, and the plan to get them home. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 30-Something Working Group is always proud to be able to come to the floor at the pleasure of the Speaker of the House and our leadership team. If anyone wants to contact us or see any of the charts or see any of the information that we have talked about on the floor this afternoon, they can e-mail us at 30SomethingDems@mail.house.gov or visit us at our Web site, www.speaker.gov/30something.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word in opposition to the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have heard many times from the gentleman from Pennsylvania the suggestion that drilling for natural gas is low impact compared to oil drilling. In fact, he even called it clean on the floor today. Unfortunately, this opinion runs contrary to scientific findings on the matter. There are drastic and devastating environmental and economic repercussions that come with drilling into the ocean floor, drilling into the ocean floor. 
   Mr. Peterson refers to the use of natural gas as a clean fuel, and that may well be true. But what we are talking about here is drilling into the ocean floor so close to our beaches, that is a problem for both my home State of Florida, as well as the rest of the Nation. 
   According to the Minerals Management Service, once exploratory drilling begins, the toxic impacts are similar for either oil or gas exploration or development. Drilling operations produce hundreds of thousands of gallons of  drilling muds that routinely discharge toxic metals such as lead, mercury and cadmium. None of those seem clean to me. 
   Water discharged from drilling and exploratory operations often contain dangerous levels of carcinogens and radioactive materials such as benzene, toluene and arsenic. None of those seem clean to me either. The impact is not just limited to the off-shore platform. Natural gas drilling requires on-shore storage and processing facilities, including miles of pipelines, roads, ports, helipads and dorms. 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania seeks to minimize the perception of the impact of drilling for natural gas, when the reality is that it would generate toxic poisons seeping into our oceans, have a significant impact environmentally on our coastline, and be a significant danger to opening the door, not just to gas drilling, but oil drilling as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to protect the oceans and breaches of the United States and oppose the Peterson amendment, both this one and the next one that is offered.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and good job on my name pronunciation. I have a hard time with it too. 
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to begin the 30-Something Working Group's special order hour tonight. Speaker Pelosi has given us the privilege to come to the floor night after night to talk about the issues that are important to the American people, from our generation's perspective. And it is something that we have appreciated for a number of years because we've had an opportunity to engage the next generation of Americans, who clearly are yearning for their government to be responsive to them, to have their confidence in their government restored. 
   And tonight what we want to focus on, particularly because General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker came to Capitol Hill this week to talk about the so-called progress, or lack thereof, which is a better expression, in the war in Iraq, we felt it was important to highlight tonight the absolute cost of the war in Iraq and the toll that it is taking on, not just our military troops, but their families and on America as a whole. 
   And I think there is no more telling statement that could be made than the one that was made by General Petraeus himself in response to Senator Evan Bayh's question, or comment, that there was much ambiguity in Iraq. And General Petraeus conceded that point. 
   General Petraeus stated this week, in fact I believe it was today, that in Iraq we haven't turned any corners; we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel. The champagne bottle has been pushed to the back of the refrigerator, he said, referencing President Bush and former Vietnam-era General William Westmoreland's famous phrases. 
   It is clear that we have made virtually no progress, and that the only things that we are celebrating at this point is that there has been a reduction in violence. I wonder what that has brought us. What has that brought Americans? 
   Well, let's go through what the so-called progress in Iraq that was described by General Petraeus today and this week, what that's brought us. 
   We spend about $339 million in Iraq every single day, Madam Speaker. $339 million. And I'd like to go through the actual monetary costs of the war in a little bit. But let me just talk about what $339 million would get us and the investments that we could make in America, domestically, in the event that we were not hopelessly mired in this war in Iraq. 
   $339 million would get us 2,060 more Border Patrol agents that could be hired to protect our borders for a year. 
   18,000 more students could receive Pell Grants to help them attend college for a year with $339 million. 
   48,000 homeless veterans could be provided with a place to live for a year. 
   317,000 more children could receive every recommended vaccination for a year. 
   955,000 families could get help with their energy bills through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, that's the LIHEAP program, for a year. 
   Nearly 480,000 women, infants and children could receive nutritional help with the WIC program for a year. 
   2.6 million Americans without adequate health insurance could have access to medical and dental care at community health centers for a year for $339 million. 
   More than 100 local communities could make improvements to their drinking water with help from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund for a year. 
   I could continue on and on, Madam Speaker, listing all the important investments that we could and should be making, were we not spending $339 million in Iraq every day. 
   Now, let me just make that comparison again. I'm talking $339 million that we're spending in Iraq every day, and the list I just went through details what $339 million would buy for a year. 
   Now, I went home to my district a couple of weeks ago when we went into recess and talked to my constituents, had a lot of interaction with them. And you know, what was amazing was how top of mind the economy is. 
   We're less than a week from the April 15 tax deadline, and I'm sure that there are folks out there tonight that are sitting and doing their taxes while trying to figure out how they're going to write that check when they're done, and wondering how they're going to take their child to the doctor if they don't have health insurance, wondering how they're going to make sure that they can put food on the table and fill their gas tank, because now that gas is over $3 a gallon, really over $3.30 a gallon, it boggles the mind of my constituents and I know the constituents of virtually every Member, no matter what party we represent, that we are actually still, 5 years later, in Iraq, with an administration that just doesn't seem to get it; that doesn't seem to be willing to recognize that it is time to bring our troops home; that we have taken too great a toll. 
   The question that my constituents and that Americans are asking is, how much is too much? At what point do we say the cost is too great? 
   I think you have to take a look at the toll that this is taking on military families. If we're not going to say that the investments we can't make because we're spending so much money in Iraq are worth the cost, then let's look at what the military leadership is saying about the toll that this war is taking on our troops. 
   An Army study of mental health, and this is from an article a couple of days ago, April 6 in the New York Times, an Army study of mental health showed that 27 percent of noncommissioned officers, a critically important group, on their third or fourth tour, exhibited symptoms commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorders. That figure is far higher than the roughly 12 percent who exhibit those symptoms after one tour, and the 18 1/2 percent who develop the disorders after a second deployment, according to the study which was conducted by the Army Surgeon General's mental health advisory team. 
   So we're not talking about organizations conducting studies examining the mental health of our troops that are outside the military process. We're talking about military organizations that are saying that the strain on our troops mentally has really reached a breaking point. 
   We have combat troops that have been sent to Iraq for a third and fourth time, where more than one in four, more than one in four, show signs of anxiety, depression or acute stress, according to an official Army survey of soldiers' mental health. There is an increasing alarm about the mental health of our troops and, at some point, something has to give. 
   Again, when do we say enough is enough? When do we say that we have to make sure that we can focus on the needs here in the United States of America? 
   We are struggling with an economy that is at its breaking point. Yet, the economy in Iraq seems to be thriving. The Iraqi government is actually dealing with a budget surplus, and we are facing a deficit. There's something wrong with that picture, Madam Speaker. 
   Let me just, I really want to turn, I think people should be given a really clear picture about the monetary cost that we are dealing with when it comes to this war, this ongoing and continuous war in Iraq. 
   This is from our nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report, the Cost of Iraq War Rising. Here's the breakdown of what we're spending in Iraq per year, per month, per week, per day, per hour, per minute and per second. 
   If you take a look at the number per year, the amount per year that we are  spending in Iraq, we're spending $123.6 billion per year. 
   Now, that's a hard number to maybe get your mind around. Billions and millions of dollars are very big numbers that most people aren't dealing with every day in their daily life. 
   So let's go down to the monthly expenditure that we're making here. That amounts to $10.3 billion. 
   But if we want to drill down a little bit further and deal with the weekly and daily expenditures, weekly, we're spending $2,376,923,077. Per day we're spending almost $339 million, as I described a few minutes ago. 
   But hourly, this is really the number, Madam Speaker, that I think will hit home with virtually all Americans. We are spending, hourly, in Iraq, and this is, again, third-party validator, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report on the cost of the Iraq war and its rising cost. Per hour we are spending $14,109,589 in Iraq. 
   I don't think it's necessary for me to go down to the minute and the second. I think the point is well made. $14 million an hour. I mean, that is just unbelievable.     
   How many is too much? When do we say that the toll that this is taking on our troops is just beyond our capacity? Since the start of the war in Iraq, we have had 4,013 brave American men and women in uniform that have been killed. We have an estimated almost 30,000 servicemembers that have been wounded in Iraq, and as of March 1, more than 31,300 have been treated for noncombat injuries and illness. 
   According, again, to the Army's own mental health advisory team, soldiers who are on their second, third, and fourth deployments report low morale, more mental health problems, and more stress-related work problems. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, these numbers right here really sent chills down my spine. An estimated three-quarters of a million troops have been discharged since the war in Iraq began, many of whom have had compromised mental and physical health. An estimated 260,000 have been treated at veterans' health facilities, nearly 100,000 have been diagnosed as having mental health conditions, and an additional 200,000 have received some level of care from walk-in facilities. That is just unbelievable. 
   I can tell you that I have been to Walter Reed Army Medical Center to visit our wounded troops that have come back from Iraq. I've told this story during the 30-Something Working Group in the past. I will tell it again because really, as a mom with young kids, it was so disturbing to me. 
   I walked into this young soldier's room to talk to him about his injury and to talk to him about what he went through, and his wife and his 6-year-old little boy were in there with him. And I had a nice chance to chat with the little boy. He was very exuberant and excited. It was really a lovely conversation. He was so excited. His dad had just come back from his third tour in Iraq, each of a year. Now remember, this little boy was 6 years old, and the father was telling me he had a stress-related mental health injury, and the father was telling me about how he was supposed to be finished with his tour in August, was still hoping to go back, by the way, which is amazing because these troops that represent the United States of America are just absolutely so committed and so patriotic, and really, I just so admire their bravery. 
   But what the little boy said when I had a chance to talk to him, he said he was so excited, my daddy is coming home after August. And when he said that, it occurred to me that this little boy being 6 and his father having been through three 1-year deployments in Iraq, this father had missed half of his son's life. Half of his son's life. That just was mind-boggling to me being a mom of 8-year-old twins and a 4-year-old. I just can't even imagine. I have children close to that age, and I can't imagine having missed half their life. I mean, that just takes a toll on families. It takes a toll on marriage. 
   Madam Speaker, even the time that myself and other parents serving in Congress here are away from our families, I know the toll that it takes on my husband when I'm here just working in Washington and not with him and leaving my kids with him to make sure that he gets them bathed and gets their dinner and the homework is done and all of the things that have to be done on a daily basis with families. It takes a toll that I am here and not with him to help him do that. 
   Add the stress of your family member being thousands of miles across the world in a war zone, in a war situation, not knowing whether they're going to ever come back, the not knowing when they're going to come back because the military keeps extending these tours of duty, keeps sending them back, does not give them enough rest in between the tours of duty. The Army, over the last several years, has extended the rest, extended the tours of duty from 12 months to 15 months, Madam Speaker, so now we are beyond a year for deployments. And General Petraeus said we may be able, by the end of the summer to pull back the length of the deployments from 15 months to 12 months, but we're still going to be at 140,000 troops once we draw down the amount of the surge. That means there is no difference, Madam Speaker, between where we are now and where we were before the start of the surge. How do you call that progress? 
   Someone is using a different dictionary than I am if that's progress. I mean, the dictionary that I use to define ``progress'' says that we see improvement, that the quality of life improves, that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, which General Petraeus clearly said we do not see right now. 
   I want to just quote, and in the 30-Something Working Group, we try to use third-party validators. So it is not just our words that we use to demonstrate the statements that we are making; we try to back up our words with evidence. 
   So let me talk about the cost to military families from military leaders' perspective. 
   General George Casey said recently on March 26 in the Wall Street Journal that 15-month-long deployments are impacting on their families, it's impacting on their mental health. We just can't keep going at the rate that we're going. 
   General Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff: Our readiness is being consumed as fast as we build it. Lengthy and repeated deployments with insufficient recovery time have placed incredible stress on our soldiers and our families, testing the resolve of our all-volunteer force like never before. 
   Let's go down to what retired Admiral William Fallon, the former commander of the U.S. Central Command said: I will certainly tell you that I think our troops are in need of a change in the deployment cycle. We've had too many, from my experience, of several of our key segments of the troop population, senior NCOs, mid- to junior officers, on multiple rotations. He said, I look at my commanders, and some of them have logged more months in Iraq in the last decade than they have at home by a significant amount. 
   Can you imagine? More months in Iraq over the last 10 years than they have at home. Imagine the cost, the toll that that takes on their families. Let us go beyond the toll on families. 
   It is pretty clear that we have had a dramatic increase in the cost of fuel and the cost of a barrel of oil just during our time in the last 5 years in the Middle East. We have gone from gas prices being a little more than $1, about $1.26 or so, to now gas prices being well over $3.30 and expected this summer to reach $4 or more. 
   I can tell you that I am a minivan mom, Madam Speaker, and I regularly drive my kids around our community and car pool with the best of them. The last time I filled up my tank, which was last week, it cost $65. Now, the last time I talked about how much it cost me to fill up my tank, and Mr. Ryan remembers this, I really feel like this is 30-Something redux. I mean, really. It's d&#233;ja 2 vu all over again. You could roll back the tape to 2, 3 years ago when we were talking about the cost of the war in Iraq and the impact, and we are basically saying the exact same thing. It is just unbelievable. 
   But the last time I talked on the floor, spoke on the floor about how much it cost me to fill up my minivan, it was about $55. And that's really only been about a year since the last time we talked about the impact of oil prices. And what the leaders that look and examine this information have said is that any time we have extended involvement in the Middle East, you see  a dramatic rise in oil prices that coincide with that. 
   The price of gas and the price of oil, in this environment and in this economy, is just devastating to American families. 
   So you have extensions of impact and extensions of costs beyond just the toll that it takes on the troops themselves, the toll that it takes on their families. There's a toll on America. There's a toll on society. I mean, it's so disconcerting and it's so disheartening to listen to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who seem to just be in utter denial. I mean, they just keep saying the same thing over and over. 
   And we've been talking about the cost of this war, and I'm so glad to be joined by my good friend, Congressman Tim Ryan from the great State of Ohio who I have shared many an opportunity to speak on the floor about the things that Americans care about in the 30-Something Working Group. 
   It's just shocking that the administration is continuing to expect more of the same and to have there be more of the same and to expect a different result. There really is, and I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Exactly. A lot of us are saying, it's time, that it is time to begin the drawdown, to begin to bring our troops home. 
   Many of us that believe it is time to begin the troop withdrawal, we're not talking about precipitous withdrawal. Our friends on the other side of the aisle like to, you know, they're really excellent at using strong language and scare tactics. And it's always interesting to listen to them try to exaggerate beyond all reasonable proportion what it is we're saying instead of actually listening to what we're saying. It would be nice if they would also listen to their own constituents because I have a feeling that they're not hearing anything different than what we're hearing when we go home, particularly when they are staring down the following facts: 
   Nearly 1.7 million U.S. troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since September 2001; 1.7 million U.S. troops. That's 1.7 million different individuals. More than 599,000 have been deployed more than once. More than 782,000 servicemembers, Mr. Ryan, have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan that are parents with one or more children. Forty percent have been deployed more than once. Nearly 35,000 troops have been separated from their children for four or more deployments. And Mr. Ryan, I talked a little bit about that 6-year-old boy that I met when I went to Walter Reed whose dad had missed half his life. And I also talked about the toll that those separations from their families take on the parent who is gone, but particularly on the parent who is home, holding the fort down, making sure that they can move their children's lives and their lives forward by themselves and the stress that that brings on a family and on a marriage. The statistics that we know about say that, according to the Center for American Progress, 20 percent of marriages of deployed troops are headed for a divorce right now based on a  survey done by the Center for American Progress. According to a report, again by the Army's Mental Health Advisory Team, work-related problems due to stress, mental health problems and marital separations generally increase with each subsequent month of the deployment. So the length of these deployments is taking its toll on families. 
   An estimated 2,100 troops tried to commit suicide or injure themselves last year, which is up from 350 in 2002. That's an astronomical jump. I mean, we've got the facts right under our noses. When do we say that we care about these troops as people, not as fighters, not as defenders of America, but as people? And when do we recognize that there is a limit to their ability to hold down their lives and to be able to return to a quality of life that they had before they left? The insensitivity is mind boggling, and the refusal of this administration to recognize that there is a cost and a toll that is being taken on these families, on the individual troops, on the United States of America and on our economy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I think it's clear, and you're absolutely right, I think it's clear that the time has come. And this is not just our opinion, but it's clear that Americans believe that the time has come to shift our focus to the dire situation that we have with our economy. 
   And I can tell you, anecdotally, when I went home to my district during our recess, I had town hall meeting, and I do at least one town hall meeting every recess; when I did this last one, I actually, Mr. Ryan, had to bring Iraq up myself, otherwise the entire focus of the questions and the comments from my constituents would have been the economy. I actually had to affirmatively talk about the war in Iraq. And there was significant responsiveness on the part of my constituents, who agreed, it is long past time to bring the troops home. But really, at the top of their mind right now is the economy. 
   And just to illustrate that point, there was a new poll done recently by the New York Times, a CBS poll that showed 89 percent of those surveyed believe the cost of the war has contributed a lot or some to the United States' economic problems. When they were asked, from what you know, how much do you think the cost of the war in Iraq has contributed to the U.S. economic problem, a lot, some, not much, or not at all, 66 percent of people who responded to this survey said that it has affected the economy a lot. And add 22 percent more to make 88 percent who believe that it has affected the economy even at all. 
   Now, this week obviously it was a big deal that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were coming to testify in front of Congress on the progress, or lack thereof, that has been made. There were lots of newspaper headlines with pictures of the general testifying, a plea from Petraeus in the Washington Post, and ``Petraeus Urges Halt in Weighing New Cut in Force'' in the New York Times. The Washington Times, ``Petraeus Warns of Iraq Backslide.'' ``Iraq Troop Levels Left Open'' in USA Today. But arguably, the newspaper in America that most closely focuses on the economy and on the financial health of our Nation is the Wall Street Journal. 
   This is today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Ryan. There is absolutely no headlines, nothing on the front page, any article related to General Petraeus's testimony. There is a little tiny entry under ``What's News'' that says ``Petraeus recommended that U.S. troop withdrawals be halted indefinitely this summer, warning that security gains in Iraq are fragile.'' I mean, that's the priority that the Wall Street Journal places on the economy versus the war in Iraq, where every other article, ``Bush to Expand Help on Mortgages,'' ``Subprime Lenders Failure Sparks Lawsuit Against Wall Street Banks,'' those are the things that we should be focusing, like a laser beam, our attention on because our constituents are suffering. 
   There are folks that I represent who are having their homes foreclosed on that in a million years these middle class folks would never have been in that situation financially if we were not focused somewhere halfway across the world as opposed to getting our fiscal house in order here in the United States of America. 
   And if folks don't believe what we're saying here, let's use the third-party validators that we always use, Mr. Ryan. I will quote Robert Reischauer, the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, also a respected institution here that is nonpartisan. He said, contrary to the notion that war spending bolsters the economy, he said recently that the ``domestic benefits of war spending have been muted because spending is stimulating economies elsewhere, not the least being the economies of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.'' 
   I alluded to these numbers earlier, and now I've found them in my notes, the price of oil and the direct correlation to our involvement in the Middle East and the skyrocketing cost of oil. The price of oil has skyrocketed since the Iraq war began. The national average price per gallon of regular gasoline  before the start of the Iraq war was $1.73. Today, it's $3.34 cents, which is an increase of more than 93 percent. And this is predictable. 
   In March 2003, Sung Won Sohn, then an economist for Wells Fargo Bank, not exactly a progressive think tank, noted that ``any time there is conflict in the Middle East, oil prices hit record figures.'' And he warned that the longer the war lasted, the higher prices would go. 
   We can't take higher prices for gas than we're facing now. We already expect this summer for them to go over $4. When is enough going to be enough?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, what I think has been really interesting is observing the struggle that military leaders underneath General Petraeus have been going through in trying to be good soldiers and toe the party line about not being ready to withdraw and for us to leave those 140,000 troops indefinitely in Iraq, which is the decision that was clearly made before General Petraeus came to testify this week. But when they're asked specific questions about the impact on our troops, the truth comes through in their statements. 
   General Richard Cody, the Army Vice Chief of Staff: ``Our readiness is being consumed as fast as we build it ..... lengthy and repeated deployments with insufficient recovery time have placed incredible stress on our soldiers and our families.'' 
   And we're not talking about retired commanders or retired military leaders, who some people might suggest are retired for a reason. We're talking about the people who are currently fully engaged in our efforts over there. 
   Lieutenant General Benjamin Mixon, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Pacific: ``We are going to have to change our strategy in Iraq to reduce the numbers of troops and thereby reduce the rotations and increase the dwell time that we get back here at home.'' That was January 27. 
   Lieutenant General Michael Rochelle, Army Deputy Chief of Staff, G1: `` ..... I should mention that it's clear that the increase in suicide, as well as other measures that we track very, very closely, are a reflection of the amount of stress that's on the force.'' 
   And, finally, Brigadier General Michael Linnington, Deputy Commanding General of the United States Army Infantry Center: ``Money is not the issue ..... They want an opportunity to catch their breath before deploying again and to have some control over their futures. They're tired and their families are tired.'' 
   We have got to reach a point where we focus on the things that we know we need to focus on, like Afghanistan, for example. We have shifted. When we went to war in Iraq originally with the stated notion of pursuing the weapons of mass destruction that supposedly Saddam Hussein had that he clearly never had, we shifted our attention and our focus away from Afghanistan, where we clearly were succeeding, where we clearly had the world community behind us and fully engaged, where we had the American people's full commitment. And when we did that, when we shifted our attention away from Afghanistan and focused on Iraq, we lost tremendous ground in Afghanistan. 
   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, said: ``So should we be in a position where more troops are removed from Iraq, the possibility of sending additional troops to Afghanistan, where we need them, clearly, certainly it's a possibility. But it's really going to be based on the availability of troops. We don't have troops, particularly in Brigade Combat Team size, sitting on the shelf, ready to go.'' 
   The military is obviously stretched incredibly thin. And when I talk to constituents and groups of folks, I'll tell you that I represent a large section of the Jewish community in my State, and I am constantly being asked by members of the Jewish community leadership, What about Iran and what if we face an increasing threat from Iran? What are we going to do then, Debbie? 
   And my honest answer is, Well, we are spread so thin militarily now that it would be incredibly difficult for us to continue our efforts in Iraq, for us to maintain and not lose ground in Afghanistan, and also pursue the possibility of staving off a significant threat from Iran. And, again, that's not something that I'm saying. That's something that is backed up by military leaders.  
   I mean it's been 2,399 days, Madam Speaker, since the September 11 attacks, 2,399 days, and Osama bin Laden still remains free. We have gone backwards in Afghanistan since we left and shifted our focus. 
   In July of 2007, a de-classified version of a National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland concluded that al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the border area with Pakistan has regained its strength over the last few years and has now reached the strength it had before 9/11. 
   We have put ourselves in jeopardy. The administration and this President talks about the war on terror, the supposed war on terror, and how committed we are to it and how we have to fight terror in every corner of the world. Well, it is incredibly disturbing that a National Intelligence Estimate, not a progressive think tank and not the critics of the administration but our own National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland, concluded that al Qaeda in Afghanistan has reached its strength that it had before 9/11. The Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, testified in February that Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai and his government control just one-third of the country now, Madam Speaker. The remaining majority is under control of either the Taliban or local tribes. 
   We have got to make sure that we refocus our energy and our effort on the priorities of the American people. I know our Democratic leadership, under the leadership of our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is focused and determined to move an agenda that is going to improve this Nation's economy. The economic stimulus package that she was able to negotiate with Leader Boehner to try to inject some stimulus into this economy, checks that are going to be coming to Americans very, very soon, those are the kinds of efforts and energy that we need to be putting in to deal with the crisis situation that Americans are facing. Not continue to insist, as the administration does, that they are right and we are wrong. Not continue to say that we need to keep the same troop strength that we have where we made absolutely no progress between now and before the surge. Basically it's almost as if we have run in place. It's just incredibly frustrating. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I'm going to end where I began. And that is to say, the toll that this war has taken on the individual troops who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, on their families, on Americans, where our administration's priorities are not focused on what they should be, which should be improving our economy and making sure that we can reduce the deficit and get our fiscal house in order and make sure that Americans have access to health care and aren't having their homes foreclosed on and the skyrocketing cost of housing, and the list just goes on and on. But at the same time, we're taking care of the needs of the people in Iraq. They have a budget surplus. Their housing needs are being taken care of. Their children's schooling is being taken care of. Yet we still have the same 140,000 troops that the administration has committed to leaving in Iraq, as opposed to trying to bring these troops home and end this hopeless war that has not made progress. And at the end of the day, as Mr. Ryan stated, we need to ensure that the Iraqi troops can stand on their own and that they don't believe for generations to come that we are going to carry them throughout history. At some point we have to let them go and stand on their own, and we have reached that time. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, we appreciate the opportunity in the 30-Something Working Group that the Speaker has given us to talk about the issues that are important to the American people and to our generation and from our generation's perspectives. We hope that the people who have heard this presentation tonight will go to the Speaker's Web site and click on the 30-Something Working Group address. The charts that we have shown tonight are on that Web site, and they can feel free to e-mail us and contact us with any questions they have.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1721, the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act. I want to particularly thank Chairman BOBBY RUSH, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, and Chairman JOHN DINGELL of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for their incredible leadership and support on this legislation. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank Ranking Member Barton, Congressman Wolf and Congressman Ramstad for their steadfast support of this legislation, as well as Ranking Member Stearns, my fellow Floridian. I also want to thank Safe Kids Worldwide for always being such a wonderful resource as this legislation became a reality. 
   On June 15, 2002, the beautiful Graeme Baker, whose picture is in front of me, attended a pool party with her entire family; her mother, Nancy, and her four sisters. Everyone was having a great time swimming, when all of a sudden one of Nancy's daughters came running to tell her that Graeme was in the spa. Nancy ran to the edge of the spa, and all she saw was dark and bubbling water. Her daughter, frantically crying and pointing into the tub, insisted that Graeme was there. Nancy jumped into the spa and saw Graeme with her eyes pinched closed, her hair and limbs moving, with the current of water from all the jets on the side. Graeme was entrapped by the powerful suction of the drain spa and could not free herself. Nancy pulled and pulled with all her strength to help her daughter. It eventually took the strength of two adults to free Graeme from the spa. Sadly, it was too late; Graeme passed away in the hospital that afternoon. 
   Following Graeme's death, Nancy and her father-in-law, former Secretary of State James Baker, became and still are tireless advocates for children's pool and spa safety. 
   When I met Nancy, I was immediately taken by her tragic story of the loss of her daughter. As a fellow mother of twins, I was most affected by Nancy's incredible desire to ensure that what happened to Graeme did not happen to any other child. She has channeled all of her energy into raising the issue of pool and spa safety to a national audience. Her passion is an inspiration to me, and I am proud to sponsor this legislation in her daughter's name. 
   The Baker family tragedy is a painful example of the need for national pool and spa safety legislation. We must implement national standards to replace the haphazard safety measures that allowed Graeme, and hundreds of children like her, to be lost in such nightmare scenarios. 
   I am a mother of three young children, and I have talked about them on the floor many times relating to various pieces of legislation. And as any mother of young children will tell you, supervision does lapse. Supervision, when children are around water, is imperative. But as a mom of twins, as a mom of a 4-year-old, I can tell you that  there are times when even the best parent, even the most vigilant parent lets a child slip out from under their view and they accidentally fall in the water. That has happened countless times. 
   Let me just tell you what most parents' view in a survey was of supervising their children around water. While 94 percent of people report that they always actively supervise their children while swimming, closer examination indicates that parents often participate in a variety of distracting behaviors. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, one in five parents believes that a lifeguard is the main person responsible for supervising children in the water. Lifeguards are a key safety measure, but they supervise an average of 25 swimmers per lifeguard. They also report that 55 percent of parents thought there were circumstances in which it was okay for a child to swim without a buddy. Within this category, 31 percent said it was okay to leave a child unsupervised if he or she swam with a buddy; 29 percent thought it was okay if the child was an excellent swimmer; 23 percent thought it was okay if the child had several years of swimming lessons. I could stand here all day, and I would still not be able to adequately emphasize that parents must adequately supervise their children whenever they are in or near water.     
   But we all know that supervision lapses. That is what this bill is designed to do. It is designed to encourage States to adopt swimming pool safety laws to ensure that suction drain entrapment, which occurs when a child passes over a swimming pool drain that has suction so strong that it holds them to the drain under water and either entangles their hair or even disembowels the child, that we can prevent this. Drowning is the second leading cause of preventable death in children 1 to 14 years old in this entire country. And even cold-weather States have hundreds of drownings every single year. 
   We can stop this. We can encourage States through funding and through education programs to adopt swimming pool and spa safety laws. I urge the United States House of Representatives to adopt this legislation so that we can make sure that we end or dramatically reduce, at the very least, the likelihood of young children drowning needlessly in a swimming pool or spa.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much to my friend from Connecticut. It is a pleasure to join you in the 30-something Working Group once again. 
   And we need to remind our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, that, on November 7, the American people sent us a very loud message. They sent us a loud message that they wanted us to move this country in a new direction. We began to do that. We heard them, and we began to do that in implementing our 100 hours agenda, our Six in '06 agenda, by adopting a bill that would establish an increase in the minimum wage, by having the student loan interest rate, by making sure that we hold pharmaceutical companies' feet to the fire and ensure that, for Medicare part D prescription drug beneficiaries, that we negotiate for lower drug prices. We wanted to make sure that we expand the research into uses of alternative energy. 
   So what do we do? We repealed the subsidies that were given away by the Republicans to the oil industry so that we can use that money more appropriately to fund alternative energy research. We passed legislation that would implement fully the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   And, on top of that, the other piece of the new direction pie was clearly the message sent by the American people, Mr. Murphy, that they want a new direction in terms of the war in Iraq. They are sick and tired of the rubber-stamp Republican Congress that we used to have giving the President a blank check, allowing the administration to go unchecked in terms of its utter lack of accountability, allowing contracts to be let with no questions asked; no hearings during the course of the years. We have now completed 4 years of this war, and up until the time when Democrats took over this Congress no questions, no hearings about the direction that the administration was taking this country and this war. A total shift from the war of necessity, which was the war in Afghanistan, which really was in direct response and had the widespread support of the American people, that really and truly was a response to the 9/11 attack; instead, a shift to a war of choice in the war in Iraq. And that was utterly unacceptable when Congress was misled and was given a set of facts on intelligence 4 years ago, when they misled Congress into voting for this war. 
   Now, we are still mired in chaos there. The administration has allowed Afghanistan to descend back into chaos when we had brought them democracy, and we had beaten the Taliban, and women had been given an opportunity to have freedom. Girls could go to school again. It was a new day in Afghanistan. And that has essentially been squandered. In favor of what? In favor of civil war in Iraq? In favor of us intervening and trying to resolve a civil war between the Sunnis and the Shiites that has gone on for hundreds if not 1,000 years? 
   When is this administration going to recognize that when we say the word, when we refer to the troops, Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to think, let's examine the term ``troops.'' I think it is very easy to look at that word and not see it in a personal way. I think that we throw the word ``troops'' around so much that we forget that troops, a troop is a person.     
   We are talking about individuals who are fighting for this country and who are doing their duty. And most of them that are over there are on their third tour of duty, Mr. Murphy. 
   I know I have told this the last few times that I have been here with my 30-something colleagues, but I went to Walter Reed. I cannot get it out of my mind, because I have two 7-year-old kids and a 3-year-old, and I can't imagine what this family has gone through. 
   But one of the soldiers that I visited when I went to Walter Reed before we voted on the escalation resolution and rejected the President's policy, when we voted to adopt that resolution, rejecting the President's policy on escalating this war, I went to Walter Reed before we voted on that. And one of the soldiers I met was with his wife and with his young child, who was 6 years old, this beautiful 6-year-old little boy. And that 6-year-old little boy was so excited that his dad's tour was going to be done in August, and he said, my daddy is coming home forever in August. 
   His dad was sick in Walter Reed. He had contracted a mysterious illness. But he had been through three tours of duty. Each were a year. And his only son, his only child was 6 years old. And that meant that he missed half of his son's life already. 
   So when we refer, you know, without thinking to the troops, the troops, if it is a brigade or any one of a number of military terms that we use for individual troops or a collection of troops, we are talking about people. 
   And if we do not make sure that this supplemental passes, the choice is a plan to get our troops home and provide them with the equipment that they need and an exit strategy and benchmarks to ensure that the we and the administration hold the Iraqi government accountable to meet those benchmarks. The alternative is a continued blank check and a directionless war that has no end in sight. 
   It is a pretty stark contrast. We can eventually see our way clear and had there been a light at the end of the tunnel and adopt the supplemental and, in addition to that, provide the support that our troops need, the equipment that they need, the plan to get them home, and support for our veterans, which is incredibly important; $1.7 billion in this bill for health care for our veterans. 
   We have this glaring, horrific problem at Walter Reed that went ignored by this administration. And thank God we had those, the heads that have rolled. But would they have rolled if Democrats weren't in charge of Congress? No. We know they wouldn't have, because, yet again another scandal would have been swept under the rug. The administration would have tried to ride it out, keep their fingers crossed, squeeze their eyes shut tight and hoped that they could endure until the next media news cycle went through. 
   No more, not now that we have balanced government, that we have the ability of this Congress to assert our oversight role and to reassert what the founding fathers envisioned, which was our system of checks and balances. 
   And I think we are all about third party validators here in the 30-Something Working Group. And I noted what this Washington Post article from Wednesday of last week, it was appropriately titled ``White House Finds Trouble Harder to Shrug Off.'' And it goes on to talk about how, in  the past, questions about its, meaning the White House's, actions might have died down without the internal administration e-mails being made public, referring to the U.S. attorney scandal. 
   There are many issues that would have just been swept aside by this administration in the past, allowed to occur and ignored by the then Republican leadership here. But not now that we have a democratic Congress that is going to make sure that we hold this administration's feet to the fire, and make sure that they are responsible for civil liberties for all Americans, and fiscal responsibility. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You know, you are absolutely right. And in addition to the oversight and accountability and new direction that the supplemental on Iraq seeks to provide for the direction that the actual conduct of the war is taking, it is really imperative that we focus on the portion of the bill that relates to what it does for our veterans because, clearly, this administration, and the former Republican leadership of this Congress, did a disservice to them. They spent, in the 2 years that I was here prior to your arrival, the careless disregard that I noticed for veterans coming from the former Republican leadership was just really unbelievable because so often, Mr. Speaker, I heard our colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle stand on the floor and profess undying devotion to our Nation's veterans and how it was imperative that we support them. 
   Well, words are nice. But that is all they were because every opportunity that our colleagues had, in the time that I was here, when I first got here as a freshman, to help our Nation's veterans, the Republicans said no. No. 
   In January of 2003, which is actually prior to my getting here, the Bush administration actually cut off veterans health care for 164,000 veterans. Don't believe me? You have only to look at the Federal Register to see the documentation of that. 
   March 2003, the Republican budget cut $14 billion from veterans health care that was passed by Congress, with 199 Democrats voting no. That was H. Con. Res. 95, vote Number 82 on March 21, 2003. 
   Then we moved to a year later, March 2004. One would think that the Republicans had a year to think about it and would have finally realized that it was time to stand up for our Nation's veterans. They certainly said it a lot. When it came to doing it, they fell short. 
   The Republican budget shortchanged veterans health care then by $1.5 billion. That was passed by Congress with 201 Democrats voting against it. 
   In March of 2005, another year later, President Bush's budget shortchanged veterans health care by more than $2 billion for 2005, and cut veterans health care by $14 billion over 5 years, and passed with 201 Democrats again voting against it. 
   Now, let's go to the summer of 2005. And I was here by then. I could not believe that this happened, because for months and months the Bush administration denied that there was a shortfall, said that there was no problem, stalled and pushed back. And finally, in summer of 2005, Mr. Murphy, after democratic pressure, the Bush administration finally had to acknowledge in Fiscal Year 2006 that there was a short fall in veterans health care that was their error of $2.7 billion. And we had to fight all summer to get it fixed and have an emergency supplemental bill just to address the shortfall. It took pressure and cajoling and shame to finally bring them to the table and get them to do that.  
   And then in March of 2006, President Bush's budget cut veterans funding by $6 billion, Mr. Speaker, over 5 years. That was passed by the then Republican controlled Congress. 
   Fast forward to January 31st of 2007. The new direction Democrats increased the VA health care budget by $3.6 billion in the joint funding resolution. 
   And now, I can tell you that in our supplemental that passed out of the House Appropriations Committee last Thursday, on which I sit, with none of the Republicans, zero voting for it, $1.7 billion to the request for veterans health care, including $550 million, Mr. Speaker, to address the backlog at the VA health care facilities so we can prevent similar situations like what happened at Walter Reed because certainly, if we didn't know what was going on in Walter Reed, we have to make sure we address the needs of our veterans in health care facilities across this country that are run by this administration's VA agency. 
   $250 million for medical administration so that we can insure we have sufficient personnel to address the rising number of veterans that are coming back from Iraq, and that we have to make sure we maintain a high level of services. 
   $229 million for treating the growing number of veterans. $100 million to allow the VA to contract with private mental health care providers to provide veterans, including Guard and Reserve members who so often are neglected, Mr. Murphy, with quality and timely care; and $62 million so that we can speed claims processing for returning veterans. 
   When I went to Walter Reed, and when I have gone home and talked to my veterans, and I know that you have experienced this too, the bureaucracy and the red tape that our veterans have to go through to get care. It is like they put roadblocks, it is like the VA and this administration puts roadblocks in front of our veterans on purpose.     
   It is like they delight in stalling them. I mean, it is not their money. I don't get it.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. Because now they finally have responsive government, Mr. Murphy. They finally know that the Members who represent them collectively in this Chamber, the Members that are leading this Chamber are hearing them, that it is not falling on deaf ears; that this institution is not of the special interests, for the special interests, and by the special interests any longer. Now we have restored this to actually be the people's House, and our leadership and our agenda is a reflection of the interests of the people. 
   And as much as they might like to say that that wasn't the case, privately in their heart of hearts when they went to sleep at night, our Republican colleagues had to lay down in the dark by themselves when they went to bed and know that they weren't addressing the needs of the American people. 
   I mean, I am not someone who lives and dies by polling, but look at the polling. Look at the numbers towards the end of last year and how the American people generally felt about the job that this Congress was doing. That is a reflection on all of us. It is just appalling that the American people would have confidence in the twenties in the likelihood that Congress was going to be responsive to them. They would express support for their individual Member of Congress, but collectively as an institution they have lost confidence in us.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I want to segue to the U.S. attorney matter because what you just said brought something to mind. But before I do that, I do want to throw out yet another example of the neglect, of the  just stark neglect, that this administration has and has had for our veterans. I mean, take Walter Reed. I have a timeline in front of me, a neglect timeline for the treatment of the soldiers that are housed at Walter Reed and that seek services at Walter Reed, going back to July of 2004. 
   First I want to just put up this Newsweek Magazine cover, Mr. Speaker. This is a young woman who clearly has lost her legs, and I think the picture speaks all that it needs to without words. But the caption on the picture on the cover of Newsweek, which was the week of March 5 of this year, says: ``Shattered in body and mind. Too many veterans are facing poor care and red tape. Why we're failing our wounded.'' And Walter Reed, there is no better example of what this article spoke to, Mr. Speaker, than the neglect timeline at Walter Reed. 
   If you go back to July of 2004, again, Mr. Murphy, in the summer before I was elected, you had Major General Kevin Kiley appointed Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Commander. 
   In mid to late 2004, you actually had our colleague from Florida (Mr. Young) and his wife stop visiting the wounded at Walter Reed out of frustration; Mr. Young, who has been a champion for veterans. Believe me when I tell you that our colleague from Florida Mr. Young is a legend, an absolute legend, that is revered in a bipartisan way in this institution. But Mr. Young said he voiced concerns to commanders, including Major General Kiley, over troubling incidents he witnessed, but was rebuffed or ignored. He said, ``When Bev or I would bring problems to the attention of authorities at Walter Reed, we were made to feel very uncomfortable.'' And the source of that was the Washington Post. 
   November of 2005, House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman STEVE BUYER announced that for the first time in at least 55 years, ``Veterans service organizations will no longer have the opportunity to present testimony before a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees.'' 
   Now, talking about closing off access to the people that we are here to serve, can you imagine that they wouldn't let veterans service organizations testify in front of the Veterans' Affairs Committee? I mean, it is just mind-boggling. 
   August of 2006, Army Major General George Weightman assumes command of Walter Reed, replacing Major General Kiley. 
   September 2006, 13 Senators, 11 Democrats and 2 Republicans, sent a letter to urge then-Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman THAD COCHRAN, Republican from Mississippi, and Ranking Member ROBERT BYRD, Democrat from West Virginia, to preserve language in the House defense appropriations bill that prohibits the U.S. Army from outsourcing 350 Federal jobs at Walter Reed. A similar provision, introduced by Senators MIKULSKI and SARBANES, was defeated by a close 50-48 vote during the bill's consideration in the previous week. 
   Then in September 2006, Walter Reed awards a 5-year, $120 million contract to IAP Worldwide Services, which is run by Al Neffgen, a former senior Halliburton official, to replace a staff of 300 Federal employees. Halliburton again. Who headed up Halliburton, Mr. Murphy? Do you recall who headed up Halliburton?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Yes, I believe you are right. The gentleman that is currently our Vice President. 
   In February of 2007, just about a month ago, the number of Federal employees providing facilities management services at Walter Reed, Mr. Speaker, had dropped from 300. There were 300 Federal employees that were replaced with a $120 million private contract run by a former senior Halliburton official, and the 300 dropped to fewer than 60. The remaining 60 employees went to only 50 private workers; 300 to 50 private workers. 
   February 19, we know it was revealed by the Washington Post that there was an expose detailing mistreatment of veterans at housing on the grounds of Walter Reed Medical Center. And what has unfolded since then is resignations of top generals, resignations of the Secretary of the Army. Heads are rolling, Mr. Murphy, as they should be, because of the profound neglect of our wounded veterans and our veterans that need assistance from that very fine institution. 
   Not only did the heads roll, but it led the Appropriations Committee last week to adopt an amendment offered by my colleague who sits on my subcommittee, Mr. LaHood, to ensure that Walter Reed Army Medical Center is not closed down because not only do we need to get to the bottom of what is going on there, but we need to make sure that that institution not only continues to serve our Nation's veterans, but serves them well.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we honor those commitments. And I was stricken by what our colleague from Georgia said at the end of the last hour when he referenced the need to be bipartisan, to come together and work on bipartisan solutions and move forward together. I was really glad to hear him say that. 
   But the room was shockingly silent for the last 2 years that I served here, that there really weren't calls for bipartisanship or locking elbows together and finding the way to the best public policy on issues of mutual concern. 
   But be that as it may, we agree that we should move forward in a bipartisan way. And, in fact, the open government and ethics package that we adopted as part of our New Direction agenda on the first day that we were here was a commitment on the part of our leadership and on the part of our Speaker  Nancy Pelosi that we would have the most inclusive, open, and honest Congress in American history. And we have steadily been doing that every single day.     
   Unfortunately, the administration doesn't seem to be buying into that same concept of bipartisanship. Again, very nice words are said. I have seen the President stand in the Rose Garden and stand on the South Lawn and stand in lots of different really attractive camera shots talking about the need for bipartisanship. And yet, again, when it has come to light that there was a proposal out of the White House to fire 93 U.S. attorneys and subsequently we have gone back and forth with the White House about what the actual truth behind those suggested and then eventual firing of eight of them was, we have not been able to get a straight answer. 
   In fact, we have had a concern that administration officials, including the Attorney General, have come before Congress and been less than forthcoming. I want to be careful about the words I choose, but it has gotten to the point where we have been told so many different things about what was behind those firings that we are at the-boy-who-cried-wolf point now. 
   Again, speaking as a mom, I know I have talked to my kids, and sometimes children will be less than truthful when they are concerned that they might get in trouble. I know that my kids sometimes are worried they are going to get in trouble and that the potential punishment is worse if they tell me the truth than if they kind of soft-pedal the actual facts, and maybe what happens to them will be not the worst thing. But I always find out. I always eventually know what really happened. And that is exactly what is going on here. 
   Any parent will tell you that they have sat their children down and counseled them, ``You know, it is always better to just tell me the truth, because I am going to find out anyway, and the consequences are going to be far worse for you when I do find out than if you were just up front with me in the beginning.'' 
   Maybe we have to talk to the President and the White House and the administration like moms talk to their kids.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Not to be your mother or anything now, but, seriously, maybe an elementary back-to-basics conversation is what is necessary, because clearly the process that they have been taking us through has been less than honest. We have had a lot of misleading excuses. 
   We have reached a point, and I sit on the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Murphy, where now our subcommittee has taken the step of feeling like in order to get to the bottom of it, we had to authorize the committee to issue subpoenas to bring the Attorney General and to bring Karl Rove and the administration officials associated with this scandal, with potentially being less than truthful to this Congress, with covering up what actually happened, maybe a subpoena may be necessary. 
   I think that is sad and unfortunate, but we cannot have less than truth when we ask administration officials questions when they come before this institution. 
   I am glad about the potential for bipartisanship. During the hearing we had in Judiciary yesterday, a number of our Republican colleagues indicated they were also unhappy with what was going on with this administration. In fact, specifically on the issue of the attorney firings, one of their top leaders, another good friend from Florida, Congressman Putnam, actually said that he questioned the Attorney General's ability to continue to serve. I will quote what he said in the Washington Post. 
   He said, ``His ability to effectively serve the President and lead the Justice Department is greatly compromised.'' During a lunchtime interview with reporters, he said, ``I think he himself should evaluate his ability to serve as an effective Attorney General.'' 
   We are talking about the number four ranking Republican in their leadership on that side. Believe me, I know ADAM PUTNAM. He has served with integrity in our legislature in Florida, and does so here. If he is at that point, then you know there is something seriously wrong. There is seriously something wrong.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Now, my understanding when this scandal occurred, we are talking about a situation where the President, I believe, was considering asking for the resignation of 93 of his own U.S. attorneys. Subsequently, they decided maybe that was going a little too far, so I think the number is eight, they only fired eight.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. If the gentleman will yield, we should point out the President believes he magnanimously offered was to offer that the officials associated with this scandal to speak with, essentially, the Judiciary Committee, not under oath, that there be no transcript, and that Congress would not subsequently subpoena them. 
   That is when Mr. Conyers said, yes, we could just go have a drink and have that kind of private conversation which reveals nothing, which has no accountability whatsoever. 
   Mr. Murphy, the other thing that I think is important to note is that the first answer that we were given about why, and these people do serve at the pleasure of President. Again, that is why I drew my kid analogy. Because I never understand when I ask my kids, and, fortunately, I have very honest children, so this doesn't happen often, but little kids, when they are learning as they are growing up, they do dumb things. 
   What brought this to mind was the first answer that the administration gave was that, well, you know, we were concerned. We lost confidence in their ability. They weren't up to snuff, they weren't very good attorneys and they weren't doing a very good job. 
   As you might imagine, these are eight pretty capable people who thought they were doing a good job. When they had their ability questioned, a bunch of them got mad. We are talking about very loyal Republicans here, some who had been long-standing supporters and contributors to the Republican Party. They went out there and defended themselves and said, wait a second. I am pretty darn qualified individual. How dare you. 
   Then we dug a little deeper. It turns out, well, it is not that they were not qualified. It is more that they weren't aggressively pursuing Democrats who were being investigated in their jurisdiction. 
   The bottom line is we really don't know. And then they started pointing fingers at each other inside the administration. First, it was really Karl Rove. No, it wasn't Karl Rove, it was Harriet Miers that called for the firings. 
   The bottom line is to restore the confidential of the American people in their government, which is what we absolutely need to do, and that is our goal. Because it was badly shaken by the Republican leadership, we need to get to the bottom of scandals like this. 
   I know we are getting closer to our end time and we want to make sure we have an opportunity to encourage people, if they have any questions or want to see the charts more closely we have seen tonight, we will give out the Web site.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you very much. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The gentleman will note that we did a lot of incredibly good work this week, passing the SCHIP bill, the Children's Health Insurance bill, passing the flood insurance bill off the floor this afternoon, passing the CR just yesterday. So there has been an incredible amount of good work done this week. And as far as the bills that you referenced, we will be planning to conference with the Senate as soon as they signify that they are ready to do that, and will be working diligently with them to bring those bills to the floor when the conference is complete and ready.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I'd be happy to answer the gentleman's question. We are reviewing all of those bills and want to make sure that, obviously, the House is on equal footing with the Senate. And when we are ready to go to conference, we will certainly join them and make sure those bills are brought to the floor in as timely a fashion as possible.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. As far as the gentleman's reference to the military quality of life bill at the beginning of your remarks, I will remind the gentleman that we did pass, in the military health care and veterans bill, the largest single increase in health care in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. So we are certainly doing everything we can to expand access to health care and improve the quality of life of our military veterans. 
   Referring to the gentleman's question about the trade adjustment act and Peru, I'll remind the gentleman that the Ways and Means Committee did conduct a markup this very week. We are fully engaged in working on the Peru trade agreement and will be working on the trade adjustment act simultaneously to the free trade agreement with Peru.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1054, to honor the service and achievements of women in the Armed Forces and female veterans. I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Chairwoman Susan Davis, for sponsoring this resolution. 
   Next Monday, we will observe Memorial Day, which honors the brave men and women who have courageously served and died in uniform. Women have voluntarily served in support of U.S. military efforts since the Revolutionary War as nurses, cooks and laundresses. Now, women have risen through the ranks and occupy the roles of generals, commanders, pilots, and drill sergeants. 
   American women have served this country selflessly and with great courage. Today, I recognize the nearly 800,000 women who have served and the hundreds who have been killed or taken prisoner of war. Their service demonstrates that women are fully capable and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country. They are an example to all women and men who will follow in their footsteps.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (HONORING VIRGINIA GRAEME BAKER -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important legacy of Virginia Graeme Baker, a 7-year-old child who was the unfortunate victim of entrapment by a residential spa drain. 
   On June 15, 2002, Graeme attended a pool party with her entire family, her mother Nancy and her four sisters. Everyone was having a great time swimming, when all of the sudden, one of Nancy's daughters came running to tell her that Graeme was in the spa. Nancy ran to the edge of the spa, and all she saw was dark and bubbling water. 
   Her daughter, frantically crying and pointing into the tub, insisted that Graeme was there. Nancy jumped into the spa and saw Graeme with her eyes pinched closed, her hair and limbs moving with the current of water from all the jets on the side. Graeme was entrapped by the powerful suction of the drain spa and could not free herself. 
   Nancy pulled and pulled with all her strength to help her daughter. It eventually took the strength of two adults to free Graeme from the spa. It was sadly too late; Graeme passed away in the hospital later that afternoon. 
   I can only imagine the immeasurable grief that her mother and Graeme's entire family went through. Today, Mr. Speaker, is the fifth anniversary of Graeme's death, and I want to take this moment to acknowledge the enormous loss suffered by the Baker family. 
   Following Graeme's death, Nancy and her father-in-law, former Secretary of State James Baker, became and still are tireless advocates for children and children's safety. When I met Nancy, I was immediately taken by her tragic story of the loss of her daughter. 
   I was most affected by Nancy's incredible desire to ensure that what happened to Graeme did not happen to any other child. Nancy has channeled all of her energies into raising the issue of pool and spa drain entrapment, a hidden hazard responsible for hundreds of injuries and numerous deaths, to a national audience. Her passion is an inspiration to me, and I am proud to sponsor the Pool and Spa Safety Act, H.R. 1721, in memory of Graeme Baker. 
   I want to acknowledge and thank my colleague Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, the lead Republican sponsor of this bill, Chairman Bobby Rush and Chairman John Dingell for their support of this badly needed legislation. 
   The progress made on the Pool and Spa Safety Act would not be possible without the hard work of the entire Baker family. I hope my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, join me in honoring Virginia Graeme Baker, a remarkable little girl, and her mother Nancy whose dedication and tenacity is truly making the world a safer place for all of our children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You have just known me longer. 
   Thank you, Mr. Meek. It is a pleasure to be here. We have been trying to get the three of us back together again. It is a good problem to have. We have a lot more on our plate now that the Democrats are in the majority. The other good part of our problem is that we have expanded the active members of the 30-Something Working Group, with the Speaker that is in the chair this evening and a number of other Members, Mr. Altmire, and we are really happy about that. 
   But I am glad the three of us were able to come back together this evening to continue our effort to speak to both our generation and to the American people, the rest of the American people, about our concerns and the Democratic new direction that we have been successful in moving in since November 7th when we were victorious in the election and when the American people indicated to this Congress that they wanted to move in a new direction. 
   We struggled through the last number of years. Gradually, and unfortunately a cloud hung over this institution and this Capitol, a culture of corruption had developed, Mr. Ryan, and we just could not allow it to continue any longer. The American people were fed up with it, and that is why tomorrow we are going to be considering lobbying reform and ethics reform, so that we can inspire the confidence of the American people once again in their leaders, both as individuals, because traditionally they have said to pollsters that they support their Member of Congress, they like their Member of Congress, but they can't stand the institution. 
   That is a sad state of affairs. We need to make sure that our institution, the one we are proud to serve in, is one that the American people can be proud of as well. There has been too much corruption here, unfortunately led by individuals formerly in the leadership in this institution on the other side of the aisle for far too long, and we need to take some significant steps to clean it up, which is why we are going to be considering this legislation on the floor tomorrow. 
   We also talked about during the campaign and leading up to, and now since Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker, took office, that we are going to implement the priorities that were important to the American people, including the minimum wage. We passed our ``Six in 06'' agenda in the first 100 hours that we were in the majority. The minimum wage was part of that. The implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations was a part of that. Making sure that we could repeal the $14 billion in subsidies that we gave away to the oil industry under the Republican leadership, that was a part of that package, and a number of other provisions. 
   Our priorities since taking control of the House of Representatives have been a reflection of the priorities of the American people. 
   We have been interacting with this President, which in my experience the only thing I can analogize it to, Mr. Ryan, is like trying to move an iceberg. This is a person who occupies the White House now that seems to have no respect for the system of checks and balances, no respect for the fact that the Founding Fathers created three branches of government that were considered coequal, and that he was not elected king of this country. The Founding Fathers very definitely intended for us not to have a monarchy, not to establish a monarchy, and he doesn't get to just decide what is going to happen, particularly when it comes to war and executing the powers of the Presidency. He does have to have input from us. 
   I can tell you from my perspective, I think from your perspective, Mr. Meek, and Mr. Ryan as well, that this is the beginning of the end. The actions we have taken, insisting upon him not having a blank check and ending the blank check and the open-ended commitments that have been there, it is the beginning of the end.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. What we are doing, you are absolutely right, Mr. Ryan, is creating an incubator for al Qaeda. That is exactly what has occurred. In fact, if you recall, we heard a few years ago a lot of back and forth from the President about whether he did or didn't say that the reason that we actually went into Iraq was because of the connection, supposed connection, between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. Then I know Tony Snow, the White House Communications Director, has said no, we never did say there was any connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. Now, yesterday and this morning at the Coast Guard Academy graduation, now, finally, how many years into it, he can hang his hat on there being a connection between al Qaeda and our involvement in Iraq. 
   Why? Because he created that situation there. Because we created an incubator and a hotbed that is an environment for that. Of course, if you have a culture like that, and I mean the culture in which bacteria will grow, just like a petri dish, if you create a petri dish like that and culture it, of course you are going to see the bacteria grow. If you create an environment in which bacteria can grow, it is going to explode like wildfire. 
   No wonder. It boggles my mind why he believes that what he is saying is not transparent to the American people. It certainly is transparent and evident in the polling numbers, because he has literally an approval rating in terms of the way he has handled this war that is below 30 percent now. 
   You would think that politically we would delight in that as Democrats. But it actually makes me sad, because how can a President be effective on any other issues when he clearly won't even be able to get the American people to listen to what he is saying because they are so soured on the direction that he has taken this country? That makes it very difficult for us to even reach out in a bipartisan way and attempt to work with him, because he has no credibility at all. He has his own party Members who are finding it very difficult to do anything in terms of their agenda domestically, and we don't see any outreach. He has created an impossible situation, Mr. Meek.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Meek. 
   I have to tell you, I have thought recently when people come up to me, you would think that there are people that would say, Debbie, Kendrick, Tim, what does it really matter? We have been spending billions of dollars for the last 5 years. We are over there in Iraq. Yeah, the American people are opposed to this, and we are in a pretty bad situation over there, and there doesn't appear to be any end in sight, but how does this affect my life? At the end of the day I am eating, my children are eating, they are going to school. Iraq is far away, and it is not impacting me whether we continue the war in Iraq or don't continue the war in Iraq. 
   Gradually day by day, the percentage of people that don't feel that way, that get it, that understand what the impact is, not just on the perception of America in the world, but what the domestic day-to-day impact is, is growing. 
   Besides the President's popularity ratings, which are in the toilet, we have a situation here where people are realizing, for example, that our National Guard is unable to be 100 percent ready to take care of us and do the job that we actually created the National Guard to do. 
   Mr. Meek, next Friday is June 1, the official start of hurricane season, even though we have had activity a few weeks in advance of the beginning of hurricane season. And yesterday NOAA came out with their prediction on how busy this storm season is likely to be, and their prediction is 10 to 14 named storms, and a good chunk to be in the category 3, 4 or 5 category. 
   We have a National Guard that has equipment that is still over in Iraq, and when it does come back, it comes back in such terrible shape, it isn't going to be ready to take care of Americans who are in need after the aftermath of a natural disaster. That is a direct result of our inability to extricate ourselves from Iraq, our inability to hold the Iraqi Government accountable, to establish benchmarks, to make  sure that there is some progress made, and that they don't have an open-ended commitment and a blank check even after the Iraqi Parliament, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek, have indicated that they don't want us there anymore. 
   There was a resolution that came out of the Iraq Parliament that indicated they didn't want us there. There is an incredible frustration among the Iraqi people about our being there. There is a worldwide concern about our presence there; and, most importantly, the American people want us to bring the troops home so that we can refocus the attention that we are paying in Iraq on training those troops to stand up on their own and for the Iraqi Government to function on their own.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Like happens to you sometimes, my blood is starting to boil because all that it takes, I'm sitting here listening to this back and forth that we're going through here and example after example about the reasons for the American people's outrage, for our outrage, for our persistence in trying to move this iceberg and get some progress and end the blank check and establish some accountability. 
   You know, it's very simple. All the President has to do is be a diplomat himself and agree to come to the table and compromise and negotiate and end the my-way-or-the-highway politics. He is not king. Yes, he was elected President, but he was elected to one branch of the government, which, the way our government is set up, is designed to work coequally with this branch of government. 
   He has disdained the legislative branch, and this is the representative body of the United States of America. The people who elect us elect us to be their voice. They elect one person, an executive, and they elect 435 of us so we can have a collective diversity of opinion and that the result in terms of the outcome of policy is a combination of that diversity. And he has no respect for it, and that's why his numbers are where they are. That's why the support for this President, the bottom has dropped out of it. 
   And that's why over the next several months we will push this iceberg with all our might, and I can feel it, that their ability to continue unabated with the disdain and disregard that this administration has shown for the American people and our opinion, it will come to an end and it's going to come to an end in a fashion that we will help bring about the change that the American people ask for. And that is the only way that this is going to happen, if we continue to fight, we continue to push hard, we make sure that we go out to our communities like we will all do next week. 
   I know I'm having a town hall meeting next Wednesday in my district to talk specifically about the war in Iraq and how people feel about it, get their feedback, talk about the other issues that are important to them, because people are tired. They're tired of the war. They're sick of the deaths. They're sick of the death toll, and they want us to be able to talk about how we're going to expand health care. 
   We have the SCHIP program that we need to reauthorize later this year. We  have 9 million kids that we need to find the money to cover. We have to make sure we can reduce the cost of health care for small businesses. We have a deficit that has ballooned out of control, that we're trying to get a handle on, no thanks to our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   We have a lot to do, a long to-do list, and it would be great if the President would just recognize that we all need to work together and end his disrespect for the American people and for the democratic process because it's gone on for far too long. And we have a lot at stake here. 
   And I just have reached my level of frustration. I know my constituents have, and that's why I'm proud of our caucus because we have hung together. We have stuck together and pushed and pushed and pushed each other so that we can get behind a policy that not all of us are 100 percent behind. Everybody didn't get their way with the legislation that we put forward with benchmarks and timelines. But you know what? That's what this representative body that we were elected to is all about. 
   It's about compromise and it's about standing up for the people who don't have a voice. They elected us to be their voice and I have been very proud to be a Member of this institution, really proud of our Democratic leadership. 
   And I'm just hopeful that we can get beyond this war and start talking about things like the $3.22 a gallon that our constituents are paying, on average, for their gas as we approach the summer season as well.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I think you are right. I think also, as the summer begins and then wears on and we have an opportunity in the summertime to go home and spend some time in our districts and interact with our constituents, that the issues that pile up, at we're going to have a difficult time dealing with, because we are still mired in this hopeless war in Iraq, are going to continue to fray the patience of the American people, and I think our friends on the other side of the aisle will hear from their constituents. 
   I keep wanting to move a little bit and talk about gas prices, and I'm chomping at the bit to do that because you've heard me talk about this before. I'm one of those minivan moms. I drive my kids around in my minivan to soccer games and to school. And last summer when we were frustrated with the rise in gas prices, I remember exploding on the floor here talking about how it cost over $55 to fill up my gas tank. And then, of course, conveniently, right before the election, the prices came down again. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that an election was imminent, and I'm sure the oil industry didn't do anything deliberate to ensure that that would happen. 
   But amazingly it is now May and those gas prices have not just crept but leapt back up, and I want to just share with you the timeline that has existed since this administration took over in the executive branch. 
   We are now paying more than double for gas than when President Bush first took office. This chart will illustrate that the average price per gallon on January 22, 2001, at the beginning of the Bush administration, was $1.47, and then as of May 21, 2007, just a couple days ago, the average price per gallon today is $3.22. 
   Now, what that means is that amounts to real money. When you're talking about it costing 20 or so dollars to fill up your tank or $25 to fill up your tank, that's a manageable amount of money.     
   But when you get to $50, $50, Mr. Murphy, is an amount that I think about. I mean, when I am faced with paying a bill that's $50, that's real money to me. To me, that gives me pause. I have to make a decision, normally, about other things unrelated to things that I absolutely have to have like gas, about whether or not I am going to actually spend $50. Do I have the money? What else will I not be able to buy if I spend $50 on this item? 
   Gas is not like that. Gas is something that's not optional. You have to drive your kids to school. You have to make sure you can get your car to the grocery store. If you don't go to the grocery store because you don't have gas, your family doesn't eat. If your kid is sick and you can't fill the gas tank, then you can't take them to the doctor, and they get sicker. How are you going to get them to the emergency room if they get so sick that you need that kind of health care? Those are real problems that Americans face when gas prices reach that point. 
   What we are doing in the Democratic Caucus and as we continue to fight to move this country in a new direction is we are working on an energy package that we will bring to the floor by July 4, an energy independence package that will ensure that we can crack down on price gouging, like the legislation that we passed off this floor yesterday, that we can really start to respond to the oil cartel and make sure that they are pursued for the antitrust violations that they engage in, and that we really invest in alternative energy. 
   The President's remarks during the State of the Union last year were just words. When he referenced his desire to see America end our addiction to foreign oil, nice words, but no action to speak of. Nothing that I can see in any policy is reflective of the words that we heard in this Chamber during that State of the Union. We, on the other hand, are going to make a difference. 
   Mr. Murphy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We are wrapping up in a few minutes, but I have got this gas tank replica here, which is pretty ancient-looking. It's actually decrepit itself. I bring it with me to the floor because it is the only explanation that I can find as to why our good friends on the other side of the aisle and this President seem totally unresponsive in trying to address this problem and work with us. 
   My only explanation is that perhaps they don't pump their own gas, or perhaps the last time they actually filled their own tank, and saw that ticker, and realized how much it cost to fill up a tank is when gas pumps look like this. That's my only explanation, given this is the 30-something Working Group. Maybe it has been since the 1950s that they filled their own tank, unlike the people that we represent, who are trying, struggling to fill their tank every day. 
   We are going to continue to back up our words with action. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 30-something Working Group under the leadership of our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise to commend my colleague from North Carolina for his leadership on the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, and I applaud him and members of the subcommittee who helped craft this bill. 
   The Homeland Security Appropriations bill is a top priority for the country, and it should be a top priority for every Member of this body. 
   Now, let's be clear. This bill protects the American people on Wall Street and on Main Street, on your street and on my street. We owe it to the American people to provide the highest levels of safety and security possible, and this bill does just that. The legislation will help protect our homes, families and communities from those who would do us harm. 
   This bill protects our borders. It fully funds the Customs and Border Protection Agency and adds 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to secure our borders. 
   This bill funds our first responders and provides them with the critical equipment that they need. It ensures that our own local police departments have access to the information and intelligence they need to perform a meaningful role in counterterrorism. 
   This bill restores the President's cuts to firefighters to ensure that those who protect our homes, our small businesses, our schools and our communities have the resources that they now lack to keep us safe. 
   The bill restores critical interoperability funding that will allow local police, firefighters and emergency responders to communicate during a crisis. 
   This bill protects our airports and our airplanes with baggage screening funding, and it protects our ships and seaports with funding for maritime security. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have my 8-year-old daughter with me this week, and as we observe the antics from my friends across the aisle, I'm reminded of a game that my daughter often plays with her friends called Consequences. Probably each of us has played that game at one time or another, but not when the stakes are as high as they are in this Chamber. 
   Basically what happens is, each child writes down on cards an event and a consequence of that event. The cards are shuffled and read out loud in a muddled sequence, with one event leading to consequences that then make no sense at all. This is not child's play, and Members of the people's House play the game of Consequences at their peril. 
   By obstructing this critical bill, they have elevated the politics of pork over the security of the American people. 
   Mr. Chairman, Republicans should stop playing the political game of consequences and join Democrats in focusing on getting things done and protecting our homeland, because the real consequences of holding up this bill are serious. That is what the election on November 7, 2006, was about. 
   I was elected in the 109th Congress, and I didn't see any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle leaping to their feet to demand that their name be published next to the appropriations request that they submitted. I didn't see anybody leaping to their feet on the other side of the aisle insisting on reform. Where were the reformers on the other side of the aisle in the 109th, in the 108th, in the 107th, in the 106th? Where were they? 
   Now, suddenly, they're leaping to their feet, saying to the American people that they know what the election on November 7 was about. Why didn't they do any of this or insist on any of this before now? Because they didn't believe in it.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Reclaiming my time, if you had one, it was not evident. It was absent because one of the main reasons that the people insisted upon putting Democrats in the majority and moving this country in a new direction is because there was an absence of reform here, an absence of oversight, an abdication of the Congress' responsibilities. 
   And that's why Democrats are in charge. That's why we are making sure that we actually reform the process, put transparency into the appropriations process, own up to the earmarks that we sponsor and make sure that people know what we're asking for when we want to bring home funding to our districts, not do it in the shadows as was the practice up until the 110th Congress.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, the Miami Herald's Broward County edition will publish the 1,130th column by writer Claire Mitchel. Claire's column, entitled ``The Third Third,'' is believed to be the longest-running, uninterrupted features column on aging in any major newspaper in America. Nothing in the last 22 years, not illness, surgery, births, deaths, computer foul-ups, vacations, hurricanes, nothing stopped Claire Mitchel from offering her unique weekly perspective on the aging of America. 
   Week after week, Claire's column has offered us wisdom, guidance, insight and gentle chuckles. Her book, a collection of her columns, was entitled ``Seeing the World Through Rose-Colored Bifocals.'' Tony-winning playwright Vinnette Carroll conceived a musical based on Claire's line, ``At our age, we don't buy green bananas.'' 
   But Claire Mitchel has been far more than a columnist. She has been a public relations person who represented everyone from Ann Landers to Eleanor Roosevelt. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; she had her own radio show; and she was an ardent feminist before mainstream America understood what that meant. 
   Claire was Coordinator of Women's Concerns for Broward County's Human Relations Division for 10 years and a co-founder of the Older Women's League. She was chosen Feminist of the Year by the Broward Commission on the Status of Women and was inducted into the Broward County Women's Hall of Fame. And through it all, she has been a devoted wife and mother. 
   In her column, marking her 85th birthday recently, Claire offered this observation: ``Today I am a woman of 85, asking the same question everyone asks following such a statement, where did the years go? My answer is, with a lot of living. 
   ``Each day, on each occasion, when there was a question of whether to do something, I chose yes. No regrets for what I did, just what I didn't do. When others hesitated, I volunteered. Mostly it was the right decision, leading me to an activity that I enjoyed.'' 
   This has been the underlying message, Mr. Speaker, of each of Claire Mitchel's weekly writings for the last 22 years: keep living every day to its fullest, no matter what age you are. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute to Claire Mitchel, whose shoulders are strong enough to have supported thousands of women by sharing with them her pearls of wisdom.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (HONORING CLAIRE MITCHEL AND RECOGNIZING WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in recognition of National Women's History Month as we wind down to the last day of this month on Saturday, March 31. First let me start off by saying how honored I am to be a part of the 110th Congress, which boasts 90 women Members serving in both the House and Senate. 
   With this year's theme of ``Generations of Women Moving History Forward,'' it is my honor to recognize some very special women in my district, the 20th Congressional District of Florida, who have done and continue to do their part to advance the women's movement. 
   Today I call specific attention to a particular group of women who volunteer their time at the Jack and Jill Children's Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Jack and Jill Children's Center is a nonprofit organization that provides family-oriented, early childhood education and support to strengthen working families. 
   The center has a volunteer Grandparent Program, whose mission is to engage older adults in volunteer services to meet critical community needs and to enrich the lives of volunteers. Jack and Jill's grandparents have the important job of interacting with little children. Whether it is tying shoes, serving meals, patting backs at nap time, or sitting with a child and practicing writing their name, these grandparents provide each child with a special relationship that he or she may not otherwise receive. 
   The success of the Grandparent Program, Mr. Speaker, is attributed to its mutually beneficial nature, to both the participants and children who receive the care. Many of the programs' grandparents are working with their own grandchildren, who will grow up in a loving educational environment, fostering a stronger sense of community, work ethic and successful life. 
   These amazing women, Mr. Speaker, are Martha Myrick, Pearline Scott, Annie Welch, Merceline Victor, Barbara Osgood, Elizabeth Dorsey, Johnnie Daniels, Maria Morency, Margaret Lewis, and Albertha Brown. They collectively average 75 years of age and have been an active part of our south Florida community all of their lives, some of whom even attended grade school together. 
   By providing a better life for our Nation's working, single and low-income mothers, Jack and Jill's Grandparent Program is moving women's history forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, exemplifies that a woman can do a job that any man can. I thank her for her service to our Nation, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell America about some of the women in my district who make positive changes in the lives of others.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Meek and Mr. Murphy, it is great to be here again.  
   I had an opportunity to engage in some dialogue with the caucus chairman on the Republican side, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Putnam). I fully expected to be engaged in a point-counterpoint discussion on the U.S. Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney scandal, and that he would be defensive, as many of his colleagues have been. But knowing Mr. Putnam as we do, he was very frustrated. He expressed deep concern. He was beyond comprehension how the administration could have dealt with this problem in the way that they did. 
   I was asked how I felt about it as a member of the Judiciary Committee. Quite honestly, under normal circumstances the President does have the right to appoint and unappoint and ask for the resignation of U.S. Attorneys that serve at his pleasure. Had it been a matter of him just saying, yes, I asked for their resignation, we have some other needs, we are moving in a different direction, whatever he said, just be straight with the American people. Just be straight with the Congress. If he had said, yes, I asked for their resignation, I can do that, I am the President. Fine. 
   But, instead, it is fabrication, it is distortion, it is no, it was not him, it was the guy behind the tree. It was his mother. Just own up to what you did. 
   Now, if the problem is what you did, you asked for their resignation because they were too good at their job and they were pursuing public corruption cases against Republicans, and we have colleagues that picked up the phone and put some pressure on these U.S. Attorneys whose resignation ultimately was asked for, that is a horse of a different color. 
   But this would have never exploded to the level it has if they had just said, yes, we did. What I pointed out in my conversion with Mr. Putnam, in past years, and I was happy to see he was frustrated and concerned and there is bipartisan concern about the action that this administration has taken repeatedly on the war in Iraq, on the U.S. Attorney firings, and on the handling of the Valerie Plame issue, and the list goes on and on. 
   Had there not been Democrats in charge of the Congress, this would have been another thing that would have been swept aside. They would have moved on or waited it out. They would have squeezed their eyes tight shut and hoped that this, too, would pass.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I want to go back to my ``mom'' analogy that I had last week. It is like how I deal with my kids. I told them, as all little kids, they get nervous when they have done something wrong. Sometimes they might not be completely truthful. And I have sat them down time and again, and said, listen, honey, if you just tell me the truth right away, it is going to be easier. I might be a little mad, but I am going to be more upset if I find out you lied on top of a lie. Young kids might not completely understand this, but grownups like the President and the Attorney General can certainly understand the more you stretch the truth, because we have to be careful about the words we use here, the harder it is to remember the last one you told, the last version of the truth you told.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. We absolutely have to make sure that we continue to exercise the system of checks and balances in our oversight role here. If we don't, I am really fearful about what else. And we have already seen the evidence of how far this administration will push and how obsessed they are with the notion of a unitary Executive and the concentration of power that they have tried to gather in the Executive, through signing statements which are notations, whole paragraphs and pages and pages of notations on legislation that we pass here. 
   We will say ``X'' must happen. And in a signing statement, the President will actually write a note that says why he doesn't have to do ``X'' even though Congress passed a law and he signed it. He has exercised more than any other President combined the so-called right to, essentially if he doesn't think a provision in the law that we have passed is constitutional, he has exercised his belief that he can ignore it or not implement it. That is what the judiciary is for. 
   So between signing statements and the abuse of power with the PATRIOT Act and National Security Letters and essentially not being entirely straightforward, for lack of a better term, I am coming up with a lot of adjectives and synonyms for the ``L'' word here, there is an incredible effort being made that seems to require more energy than the straight-up truth does. 
   That is why the oversight role is so important. If we are not here asking questions, then the administration will run rough shod over the Constitution. They have proven that.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I thank the gentleman. On Friday, what we said was no more blank checks, no more war without a strategy and a plan to get our men and women in uniform home, no more sending troops over into combat, into harm's way without the armor they need, without the preparation they need, without the rest they need. All of those items were in that Iraq War supplemental. 
   The alternative, what the President preferred, was just give me the money, just give me the money; do not ask me any questions. He was opposed to his own benchmarks. The benchmarks that he laid out on January 10 were in the bill, the ones that he said the Iraqi people have to meet, that the Iraqi leadership has to meet, and we added some that said, you know what, you have to make sure that you think about protecting the men and women we are sending over there.

Words are nice, but when you go, like each of us have, to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and you look those troops in the eye and you have a chance to spend some time with them, the words ring really hollow unless you know you can back those words up with some action, with some commitment, with some belief in the mission and understand how devoted these men and women are to getting the job done. 
   I mean, listen to some of the folks that are in that hospital, they all, to a person, have told me when I have been there, they want to go back. They want to get better, and they want to go back to join their comrades, their buddies, and help finish the job, but we have to make sure that we have their back.

As we conclude, the President is so stubborn and so ``my way or the highway,'' that his own definition of victory, the benchmarks that we have put in this bill, he is threatening to veto. That is  what is mind-boggling, even when we insert his milestones. Still, that is not acceptable.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you to my good friend from Youngstown, Ohio. 
   You know, your comments sort of bring to mind that our good friends on the other side of the aisle want to have their cake and eat it, too. They were the ones responsible for putting us in this situation where we have to adopt a continuing resolution that is essentially continuation funding that in order to put a finger in the dike and make sure that things don't get any worse and that we can begin the process for the 2008 budget and getting our fiscal house in order. It was them that only were able to pass two out of all of the spending bills that were in their hopper. It was them that left us this mess. 
   And now, you know, you will see over the next couple of days, Mr. Murphy, our good friends on the other side of  the aisle actually stand up and criticize their own budget, which is what the CR is. They will try to put our colleagues on our side of the aisle who were just elected, who, you know, campaigned against fiscal irresponsibility in a box and make it seem like somehow this continuing resolution is what we crafted when we are in a situation where it is shut down the government or pass the simplest, most effective way of getting us across the finish line so that we can move on and really address the concerns that we talked about during our 30-Something hours in the 109th Congress, which was that we are in the worst financial shape that we have been in in decades, that we have a foreign debt that is more combined than any of the 42 previous presidents combined. 
   And yet they will try to have their cake and eat it, too, criticize us on their budget that we are going to have to continue but, at the same time, not claim responsibility for it. It is really going to be shocking. 
   So it is something that I think it is important that we talk about and that we lay out there. Because, you know, this process, the appropriations process is one of the most inside baseball, nitty-gritty, intricate things that we do, and there are Members that have been here for years, and I am just, as a new member of the Appropriations Committee, you know, even though I am chairing a subcommittee, I still have a significant learning curve. So explaining it to the people that we represent, while they are watching it all unfold on TV, is really somewhat difficult. So it is critical that people understand that. 
   I actually talked to some of our colleagues on the floor tonight when we were talking about the CR and, you know, all lamenting that we are not able to craft a bill that we would all love to support with the increases that the veterans deserve and the increases that are deserving in education, that are critical in terms of education and health care and health and human services and housing. I mean, those are all programs that Democrats have campaigned on and fought for. But because we have colleagues that spent like drunken sailors, that had no regard for the fiscal house that we are now charged with putting back in order, we find ourselves having to cinch the belt as tight as possible just so that we can get through and start making things right. 
   I think each of our colleagues, particularly the freshmen like you, Mr. Murphy, are going to have an important task of going back to your constituents and explaining that we have got to be responsible here first. Give us an opportunity to get through the mess that we were left and then we can really show you what we can do. 
   Be happy to yield.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. What we talked about night after night here and what our colleagues and our leadership have all talked about, we have all been singing off the same song sheet, that we have to make sure that we handle the Federal budget just like folks struggle in America to handle their household budget every single day, not to spend more than you take in. 
   There are families all across America, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Meek, Mr. Ryan, that have to make really difficult decisions. Would they like to go and buy a new wardrobe for their children? Would they like to get the car completely overhauled? Definitely important and 
   certainly would improve their quality of life, but they can't make those decisions if the money is not coming in in order to cover those expenses. 
   So at a certain point, if you don't stop the bleeding, if you don't make those fiscally difficult decisions, then it just gets worse. 
   We could have been, you know, we could have played right into their hands, which is, I am sure, what they expected us to do, which was what they always accused us of being tax-and-spend liberals and that we were going to just give away the store and that we were going to satisfy every interest group that is in the column of supporters that we have. 
   But, instead, what we did is we stuck to our principles. We stuck to what we talked about was important to the American people, not spending more than you take in and particularly not caving to what would be politically expedient, which was the tax cuts, as you referred to, Mr. Murphy, for people who don't need them. 
   Because what they like to conveniently leave out is that they only count, you know, there are only certain things that they count in the ledger. They only count the things in the ledger that are actually things you can put down as I spent this much money on this particular program. But they fail to actually account for the tax cuts that pull money out off the ledger, which makes it so that there is not that revenue available to fund the needs, and that adds to the deficit itself. 
   They also don't include Social Security and Medicare when it comes to the whole appropriation process. All of that is off budget. They don't like to count the supplemental bills that they pass. All of that is off budget. 
   So it is just, you know, we are going to get back to being up front and honest with the American people in our budgeting process, and we are going to get our fiscal house in order.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I see Mr. Meek is ready to jump in here. But we are going to be the Congress and exercise our role, our accountability, our oversight, and be the legislative branch instead of the administration lap dog. Because that is what this body was for the last 6 years certainly. When President Clinton was in office, it was the opposite. It was, let's see what we can do to torture the administration and make it impossible for them to get what they wanted done and wanted to accomplish. 
   Then, of course, President Bush comes into office and it is like they all lost their hands. They lost their hands, they checked their brains at the Chamber door, and it was whatever this administration wanted. 
   And there is a new leadership in this institution and 32 new Members, all of whom came here to step up to the plate and ask the difficult questions and exercise this body's constitutional role, constitutional authority granted to us by the Founding Fathers, which hopefully at some point our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will remember as well. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, and it is. The other day I walked into the Chamber, Mr. Murphy, from that end of the room, and I noticed that there is a really huge, huge dictionary on the Republican's side of the Chamber which, quite honestly, it doesn't appear has gotten that much use on their side of the aisle, because words like accountability and oversight and checks and balances, and the things that have been with us through American history, maybe they tore the pages out that had those definitions or maybe they just chose to ignore them or just skipped over those pages when they were using it because, obviously we have a dictionary on the floor for a reason, but now, Mr. Meek, just in great detail went over the number of different hearings that we will be engaging in to exercise the oversight and the accountability that the American people badly are seeking that has just been nonexistent. 
   And, Mr. Meek, I want to touch just quickly on one particular bit of oversight that we are going to be engaging in on Wednesday. I have the privilege of sitting on the House Judiciary Committee, and we will be holding our first hearing of the 110th Congress on Presidential signing statements. Now, that is something that we really haven't had a chance to talk about too much on the floor during 30-something, but I would like to explore it down the road a little bit, especially after we hold this hearing. 
   Most of the American people, I think, don't realize that what this President  has done, and other Presidents, many Presidents have exercised this option, the constitutionality of which I think is somewhat troubling. But this President has used Presidential signing statements more than any other Presidents combined. He has added more than 700 signing statements to legislation that we have adopted in both Houses of Congress. And what he does is he adds a note essentially to the bottom of the bill or to the margin of the bill next to a section that he doesn't agree with and he says: ``I either reserve the right to not enforce this section or to interpret this section in this way.'' I mean, literally taking authority for the executive branch that I believe the Founding Fathers didn't envision. I mean, he did that with the PATRIOT Act, he did that with a number of significant pieces of legislation, Mr. Meek, and it is really, really troubling. 
   The executive branch in the Constitution does not have the right to interpret legislation. That is not their job. It is the Judiciary's responsibility to interpret legislation; it is the administration's job to execute what is laid before them by the Congress. Now, he certainly has the right to veto legislation that he doesn't agree with, but he doesn't have a line item veto; he doesn't have a line item veto in the budget, and he can't X out a portion of a bill that he doesn't like. And we are going to be holding a hearing on Wednesday, and we will have the Department of Justice representatives there to question very carefully where they think they get this legislative authority, and reassert Congress's role in oversight in this one area and in many others, as you detailed. 
   I guess we are in the wrapping-it-up stage, because that is when the Web site chart comes out. I will be happy to yield to our good friend and freshman colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to ask the Members to join me in paying a special tribute to one of the most respected and knowledgeable staffers here on Capitol Hill. After more than 30 years of Federal service, Chuck Turner is retiring from the Appropriations Committee today. 
   Chuck is one of the finest examples of a public servant that we have in this institution. He has worked tirelessly on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for more than 20 years, and leaves behind a record of integrity and service to this institution that few can match. 
   The tremendous expertise and insight he has brought to the day-to-day oversight of the House of Representatives and the entire legislative branch will be sorely missed. I have gotten to know Chuck over the past 2 years in my role as Chair of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. We owe Chuck a deep debt of gratitude for the great contributions that he has made, and this rookie Cardinal owes him a tremendous personal debt.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chairman, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member on a very well-crafted and bipartisan bill. I'd like to particularly thank the chairman for including a nearly $100 million increase to the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   My amendment would add a $3.5 million increase to Ryan White title IV funding. 
   Title IV's unique model of coordinated, family-centered care has proven successful at promoting better health. HIV-positive children treated by title IV have reduced hospitalizations, fewer symptoms, and fewer opportunistic infections, resulting in overall improved health and longer life. Babies are more likely to be born HIV-free if their HIV-positive mothers receive prenatal care through a title IV program. 
   Nearly 90 percent of the people cared for by title IV live below the poverty level, and 88 percent are African American or Latino. 
   As HIV infections in women and young people continue to rise, disproportionately impacting low-income women and youth of color, title IV programs have needed additional resources in recent years. 
   A $3.5 million increase to title IV will prevent cuts to HIV services for women, children, youth and families living with HIV. Even this modest increase can help bring more pregnant women and young people into care and keep them in care. 
   Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member as well, and I want to acknowledge the advocacy and support of Congressman Hank Johnson from the State of Georgia as well. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (EFFECTS OF TROOP DEPLOYMENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the opportunity tonight in the 30-Something Working Group to talk about an item that is extremely important to America and particularly important to America's military families, and that is the effects of troop deployment on the children, families and communities of military personnel. 
   Speaker Pelosi has been so supportive of the notion that we need to make sure that we shape our policy, particularly around our Nation's veterans, in support of our military families. The extended troop deployments, the tour after tour of duty, I know that so many of us as Members have met with soldiers' families and met with individual troops who have said they are on their third and fourth tour of duty, that they are having extended deployments, that they are having a much shorter than they are supposed to time between deployments. Normally they are supposed to go through about 365 days between deployments. Those times have not been respected and they have been sent back much sooner. 
   Since October 2001, approximately 1.6 million U.S. troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Deployed family members are leaving behind parents, children and spouses to provide a selfless patriotic service to our country. However, families are also asked to make great sacrifices when dealing with the stress and anxiety of multiple deployments, limited and infrequent communications, and the separation of a family member. 
   In this Month of the Military Child, we thought it was only appropriate that we show our support for those that themselves provide so much support to our soldiers and discuss the consequences of these prolonged separations. 
   I would like to begin, Mr. Speaker, with a story of the Lopez family. The Lopez family is right here. They were profiled in the Sesame Workshop Talk, Listen, Connect Series. Ten-year-old Ernesto, who is the little boy right here, and 6-year-old Jennifer, live with their mother and baby brother on Fort Bragg in North Carolina, which is home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces and one of the largest military bases in the world. Their dad, Staff Sergeant Ernesto Lopez, is in Iraq on his third tour of duty. 
   Look how little these children are. The daughter is 6 years old. If he is on his third tour of duty, and most of these tours of duty, Mr. Speaker, are, as you know, about a year each, that means that he has missed half of Jennifer's life already. Half. It is just unbelievable. 
   Jennifer keeps a special calendar in her room to mark the days until her dad comes home. Ernesto sleeps with a duplicate of the small ball that his father carries, a soft army ball with a molded helmet and a soldier's face, onto which Ernesto drew a heart that means ``we love each other,'' in his words. Even baby Elan, who was born 2 days before his father was deployed, has a soft-sided photo album filled with pictures of his dad that his mother hopes will ease his recognition when he returns. 
   Imagine. It is going to be incredibly difficult for this family to go through the restoration of bonding that military families inevitably go through. I can't imagine having just given birth and having to leave to go across the world and not know whether or if I would see my family again. That is what our men and women that are fighting for us in Iraq are going through every single day. And as Ernesto, Jennifer, Elan and Mrs. Lopez know so well, when a parent is deployed, the entire family is deployed. 
   The Lopez children are an example of the 1.2 million children under the age of 10 who have a parent or parents on active military duty or in the Reserves, which is more than at any other time since World War II. 
   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are going to be discussing the burdens of deployment on the children, families and communities of the brave men and women that serve us in uniform. Families and communities of military personnel are making huge sacrifices every day for the protection of this country, and we must be prepared as a Nation to ensure the well-being of military families, welcome home our brave soldiers at the end of their tours, and provide for their safe reintegration into their communities. 
   At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman who suggested that the 30-Something Working Group take up this subject during our weekly hour. He is a tremendous leader when it comes to the issues important to veterans and military families, Chairman BOB FILNER, the gentleman from California.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Filner, your leadership on the Veterans' Affairs Committee has just been second to none. Your commitment to our military families has been so incredibly important in trying to make sure that we can highlight their needs and the struggles and difficulties that they go through; and the policy that you are shaping in your committee to make sure that we can improve their lives. 
   Look at the statistics there. The statistics there show just exactly what the impact is on our military families. The dark green shows 2003 to 2005 what you had in infidelity, it was about 4 percent. Fast forward to 2007, and we are at 15 percent. You go to divorce. We are at 11 percent 2003 to 2005, and you are up to 20 percent in 2007. And then look at any other problem. And of course the military families have problems just like anybody else, but look at the explosion of problems that military families have had in terms of their marital problems. In 2003 to 2005, it was 12 percent and they are at 27 percent now. Granted, war is a stressful situation, Mr. Chairman. But, my gosh, we need to do more. And I know that your committee is committed to doing that.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Can I ask you a question on that? Given your expertise and your professional background in psychology; obviously posttraumatic stress disorder is incredibly stressful on families, and I just want to bring up some statistics and maybe have you comment on them. 
   We have documentation that servicemembers who are given a diagnosis of PTSD were significantly more likely to perpetrate violence toward their partners, with more than 80 percent committing at least one act of violence in the previous year, and almost half at least one severe act. And that source, the third-party validator we have on that is the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, and that was back in 2003 that they cited that. 
   The stress on families, beyond the deployment, which is obviously incredibly stressful. When they come back and they are suffering from PTSD, that has to have an incredibly horrific impact.

   And I thank all of you for coming this evening, because you all have some unique experience and involvement, unique constituencies who are significantly impacted by our troops' deployment in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   And someone who in particular has a specific family member who has inspired him is Congressman Jerry McNerney, who actually was inspired to run for Congress by his son, Michael, who in response to the attacks from September 11 sought and received a commission in the United States Air Force. And Michael suggested that his dad serve his country, too, by running for Congress. And when they pulled together as a family, Congressman McNerney decided that that was what he needed to do. And we were so pleased when your victory became clear on election night in 2006, and it is with a deep sense of duty and your family's support that I know you are serving here and serving admirably. 
   So, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. McNerney, thank you. It is wonderful we have someone of your stature and your commitment, that is willing to come to the floor and talk about the importance of making sure that we take care of not just the troops but of the troops' family members because they are making a decision to serve the public as well. They make sacrifices, and we all wanted to come together tonight as House Democrats and talk about the sacrifices that those families make. 
   It is my distinct pleasure to yield to my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Zack Space, whose father served in the Marines during the Korean War, and who also serves on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and has been a passionate advocate on behalf of issues important to veterans and their families.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much, Mr. Space and thank you for your commitment. You really have been representing your district proudly, and I know they're proud of you. And I am honored to serve with you. We truly appreciate your being here this evening. 
   It's now my pleasure to yield a few minutes to my 30 something colleague who is a little bit more familiar with the normal give and take that we have in the 30-Something group. This is a little more staid and low key for 30-Something, but we're trying to help you all keep up with the pace. And feel free, to my colleagues, to jump in. We usually have a little bit more dynamic style in the 30-Something instead of a one at a time type of approach. 
   So my colleague, Congressman Altmire, from the great State of Pennsylvania, I have to tell a story before I yield to you. And you've heard me tell this before. 
   Literally, I'm on the whip team for our caucus, and it was my responsibility right after Mr. Altmire's election to sidle over to him and talk to him about some legislation that we wanted him to vote with the caucus on. And literally, his first words to me were that he had to make sure what the impact was on veterans, and that he came here to make sure that the quality of life of our Nation's veterans was upheld and that that was paramount to him. So I thought that was really admirable and wonderful; and you have represented veterans in your community incredibly well. 
   And I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. And thank you for really making America's military, veterans as well as the troops currently serving, a high priority for yourself and your agenda and the issues that you champion on behalf of the people in the district that you represent in Pennsylvania. 
   I want to turn now to another Pennsylvanian who served in the United States Navy for 31 years and rose to the rank of three star Admiral. His battle group conducted combat operations in Afghanistan and precursor operations to the war in Iraq, and he is one of our caucus' foremost experts on the issues that are important to military families and that are important to us as we try to wrestle with this very difficult issue of how we're going to extricate ourselves from this war in Iraq. And our caucus has tremendous respect for your service. And it's my pleasure to yield to Congressman Joe Sestak.

Thank you so much, Mr. Sestak, for your 31 years of military service and now your continued public service to our country and to the citizens of Pennsylvania and your district. We really truly appreciate your expertise and the heart that you put into this job in representing your community. So thank you so much for joining us.     
   It's my pleasure to turn to someone who I admire and respect and look up to. She is one of the few women that are in a leadership role in our Congress on the Armed Services Committee, and she is really a person who has broken through on the issues that are important to the military and the military families and provided a different perspective, as women often do. 
   And this was such a tremendous source of pride for me, Ms. Davis, that you chair the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, which is an incredibly important assignment of the House Armed Services Committee; and you represent the community of San Diego so admirably in this institution, and  you have been a champion on behalf of veterans and military families. 
   It is my pleasure to yield to you. Thank you so much for joining us.

   Mr. Speaker, I sense that our time is drawing to a close. 
   The whole point of doing this 30-Something hour focused on the impact of deployments on military families was to try to improve the quality of their life and decrease the impact, the negative impact. 
   I just want to show you an important statistic here is that less than 50 percent of military families felt that they had support available through all of the phases of their family members' deployment, and that is absolutely unconscionable. It is something that Chairman Filner and the members of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the Veterans' Affairs Committee, have been working very hard at trying to improve, and that is what the Democratic Caucus, under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, has been absolutely committed to. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to yield 30 seconds to Mr. Space, and then we will wrap up.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Miller for his recognition. 
   I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act and want to thank my good friend, the chairman, for his leadership and the members of the committee for their exceptional work. 
   While I am very supportive of the bill's overall goal, I have a concern that the bill incorporates the Bush administration's proposal to significantly cut the yield on all lenders across the board. Students and parents have saved millions of dollars due to smaller competitive lenders offering consolidation loans at lower interest rates. Greater competition leads to lower prices and more choices for the consumer. 
   I do want to thank the chairman for his recognition of small lenders. And quite honestly, he's worked very, very hard to get the legislation to this point, and I know he continues to try to do that. 
   I want to thank the chairman for eliminating the origination fee for small lenders because that's an important part of this bill as well. It will lower interest rates for students in the future. But we must ensure that individuals currently enrolled do not pay more when they're starting to repay their loans. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the ranking member and hope that this matter will be addressed in conference, and I know the chairman has committed to continue to try to do that. We must ensure that we help all students, parents and lenders equally and fairly.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. And I want to go back to the minimum wage for just a second, because this is the second day now that we have had the opportunity to watch Speaker Pelosi preside over our legislation that is passing out of the House of Representatives with the speed that we want, which should demonstrate to the American people that we share their priorities. 
   Yesterday was H.R. 1. Today was H.R. 2. And one of the things that, combined with the Six in 2006 agenda and our commitment to move this country in a new direction, that she committed to on our behalf was bipartisanship and making sure that this is the most inclusive bipartisan House of Representatives in history. And what I thought was the most emblematic of that and that was really telling of the difference between the way we are running this institution versus the way the Republican leadership ran it is that I looked up on that board with the 
   vote tally at the end, and this is the first opportunity that we have had in the time that I have been here, in 10 years, as the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) indicated, the first opportunity we have had to have a straight up-or-down, clean vote on the minimum wage. The first chance. 
   Before, we had to go through all this rigmarole and shenanigans, and we had to do motions to recommit and use procedural moves in both the Appropriations Committee and on this floor to get remotely close to a vote on the minimum wage. And you know how in the last Congress, in the 109th, when we would come on the floor as the 30-Something Working Group and we would lament the antics of the Republican leadership and the arm-twisting that they did, and even on those procedural motions where we were trying to get a vote even close to the minimum wage, they would wrench the arms of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle behind their backs and make them vote ``no.'' 
   Well, what was the vote today? That vote on H.R. 2, on the minimum wage, there were 201 Members more that voted ``yes'' than voted ``no''. There was a 201 vote difference. Now, we have fewer than a 201 vote margin here. We are in the majority, but our majority is about 30 or 32. It is not 201. So look at what bipartisanship and inclusiveness does. And when you are finally allowed a free vote, a straight up-or-down vote on the American people's priorities, we had a huge bipartisan margin to increase the minimum wage. And that is beautiful. That is what democracy is all about. 
   Now, without violating rules and directly addressing the Speaker, it is so refreshing to see my good friend from Florida in the Chair tonight, and that is about as close as I will come to naming the gentleman from Florida, but I really was so gratified to watch us begin to go through the Six in 2006 agenda and finally deal with the priorities of the American people. 
   Lastly, Mr. Delahunt, I want to thank you for your kind words. The thing that makes me so humble and proud and excited about the opportunity that I have to chair a subcommittee in appropriations is, if you recall, Speaker Pelosi last week, when she took the gavel from the gentleman from Ohio, she talked about how she was able to bust through the marble ceiling. And the wonderful thing about Speaker Pelosi is that when she did it, like the leader that she is, she took other people with her. She didn't just bust through it for herself. Her busting through the marble ceiling gave so many of us, the diversity of this caucus, an opportunity to be a participant in making the world a better place for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you to my good friend. 
   Before you are excused, though, I do want to tell you, you were so kind in your words about the three of us and you have been so helpful to us over the last 2 years and joining us here night after night on the floor. But, quite honestly, I really want to commend you on your eloquence and your commitment on this issue in particular. You have been one of the key leaders of the Out of Iraq Caucus. You have kept this caucus focused on those issues that are incredibly important. 
   As my good friend, the gentleman from Florida, indicated in his remarks earlier, one of the major reasons that we were returned to the majority of this institution is because of how strongly people feel about the situation with the war in Iraq. And so thank you very much for helping with that effort. 
   With that having been said, one of the things that I think that is going to be important in about an hour from now for the American people to note when the President makes his remarks to the Nation is that what we heard the President say repeatedly, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Meek, over and over again over the last several years, was that his strategy was going to be tied to the advice from his military leaders; that he was going to listen to the generals; that he was going to take a page from their book, take their lead, use whatever expression is applicable. 
   But I guess he was just kidding, or maybe he was just saying that he meant that until he wasn't hearing what he wanted to hear. Because at the point that his belief in the direction that we should be going in Iraq departed or parted company with the advice of his military leadership, that is the point that he decided to stop listening to them. We have now shifted the military leadership in Iraq. And I certainly realize that, particularly in a democracy, there is going to be a wide range of opinions even among military leaders. But the current military leadership that President Bush has brought in does support the strategy and the direction that he is planning on taking America tonight and in this war on Iraq. And it is just astonishing that this continues the pattern of this administration, where they ask their questions, or make statements and pursue a goal, an agenda and surround themselves only with people who agree with them. 
   I just, one of the things that I know we are going to hear from the President tonight is a caution that victory, if we achieve it, won't be similar to other military victories. He will talk about, as opposed to the Mission Accomplished banner that was emblazoned over his head on the deck of a battleship, he will caution us tonight apparently that that is not what victory will look like if we ever achieve it in Iraq.     
   It will not be perfect, and that the outcome will not be traditional. Well, it sure will not. It is hard to imagine that we are ever going to achieve a semblance of victory. One of the things that we intend on doing as Democrats and aggressively doing is holding this administration accountable. The question has been asked repeatedly by commentators and by our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   There has been a question mark about whether or not Democrats will have the nerve to actually address the issue of funding these additional troops. And Speaker Pelosi has talked about how we absolutely are committed and will continue to be supportive with funding and every other measure of support for the troops that are there. 
   There is no question we would never pull the rug out from under the troops that are there fighting on behalf of America and fighting on behalf of democracy. But we absolutely should question this strategy, which is completely contrary to the goals and desires of the American people, and which is contrary to the advice of the military leadership. 
   There is no question, I believe there is no question about Democrats' nerve; no question about whether we plan on holding the administration accountable, which hasn't occurred in years. There has been, like you said, no opportunity to question the administration's choices and direction on Iraq; no opportunity to actually cast a vote on whether this new direction would receive and was worthy of funding. 
   I truly believe that is an opportunity that we will be having and that we should have and that we should accept, because the American people elected us to make bold decisions and make sure that we can move this country in a new direction, domestically and in terms of our foreign and military policy. I look forward to finally being able to reassert this institution, the United States House of Representatives' role in the system of checks and balances, because the unitary philosophy the executive branch in this administration supports is wholly contrary to the Constitution.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I know our good friend from Rhode Island wants to talk about H.R. 3, which we will be considering tomorrow. But the Iraq Study Group, which you briefly touched on a few minutes ago. It is amazing how that just almost has faded into oblivion; that their recommendations, the number of months they worked, the expertise that was put together, led by former Secretary of State Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton, very well respected. 
   Nowhere in their recommendations, am I right, was there an escalation of troops. Was there any indication in the Iraq Study Group, who arguably is the finest group of experts that could have been put together to make recommendations, nowhere in there was an escalation of troops. At least from what I noticed, and you can correct me if I am wrong, the President essentially just dismissed their recommendation and moved on and went in the direction that he chose to go. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to yield to my good friend, to our good friend, the gentleman from Rhode Island, because we are dealing with an important piece of legislation tomorrow that has already been put on the President's desk once. And as part of the new direction for our Six in 2006 agenda, we are going to put it on his desk again, because maybe he will get it right a second time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much, Mr. Altmire. It is a pleasure again to join my colleagues in the 30-Something Working Group. And I'm so glad that our newest members of the Working Group, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Altmire, have been holding down the fort for the last little while talking about spending priorities, because that is actually the most glaring difference between the Republicans and the way they handled this institution and the Democrats and the way we are handling it. 
   Let's take the problem that we're facing here now that you've been talking about, and that is that the President vetoed the Labor Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. And I am proud to sit as a member of the Appropriations Committee with Mr. Ryan. And I can tell you that the difference in the overall spending plan that the President put forward versus our 12 bills combined amounts to $22 billion. Now, $22 billion might sound like a big number, but let's put it in context.     
   Twenty-two billion dollars is approximately what we are spending in Iraq in 2 months. That's the difference between what Democrats in Congress are proposing to spend for all 12 bills combined, the difference between the President's proposal and the Democrats' proposal. That problem underscores the fact that the President only has one spending priority, and that is the war in Iraq. The problem is that the only spending priority that matters to President Bush is the war in Iraq. It's not even the war in Iraq and Afghanistan because he has so clearly shortchanged what was going on in Afghanistan when we started, which is where the war on terror, or the pursuit of bin Laden was ongoing that we abandoned when he shifted the focus of America to the war in Iraq, that it has blocked out the sun. His spending priority, his only one, the war in Iraq, has blocked out the sun and made it impossible for us to move forward on things like education, like expanding access to health care for children, like making sure that we can pass a stem cell research bill that the vast majority of this country supports. 
   I will just give you an example of one of the things that resulted from the veto of the Labor-HHS bill and that is the increase in Ryan White title IV funding for AIDS programs for families. We have an explosion of AIDS in this country. We absolutely need to make sure that we get a handle on it. There hasn't been an increase in title IV funding in years. Now that we are in charge and are making sure that we move this country in a new direction, we are focusing on the domestic priorities of Americans. Americans want us to withdraw our troops from Iraq in a responsible way and focus on things that they care about when it comes to their everyday lives. That is literally what the Labor-HHS appropriations bill does. It is an expression of our values. And our values reflect the needs of Americans when it comes to their health care, when it comes to their education, when it comes to their environment at work. And the priorities and values reflected in the Republicans' agenda is the war in Iraq. 
   Now, I think the American people clearly stated what their intentions were and what they wanted Congress to do last November 7, and we have repeatedly, and we did again tonight just before we came on the floor this evening for the 30-Something hour, they have repeatedly urged us in Congress to begin a responsible withdrawal of our troops, to stop sending the troops over for tour after tour, the same men and women, the same strain on their families, sending them over there without the equipment that they need, sending them over there without the proper training, with tours of duty that are beyond the appropriate length of time, stretching families, causing divorces, causing strain, psychological impact on children, but they don't care. It just doesn't matter. The President's priority is Iraq, and everyone else's opinion be damned. 
   I will be happy to yield to the gentleman.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. 
   Here is the bottom line. There is a dramatic and stark difference between the Republicans' priorities and the Democrats' priorities. There is one priority, and only one that you will ever hear from the other side, and that is to continue to fund the war in Iraq, continue to put our troops in harm's way, continue to have their families separated from them, continue for them to have longer and longer tours of duty,  more and more strain, more and more tours of duty. 
   Here are our priorities. We passed the largest increase in veterans benefits in the 77-year history of the VA. We passed legislation to increase the minimum wage. We passed legislation to expand access to health care for 10 million children. We passed legislation to cut the student loan interest rate in half. The list goes on. 
   And what do you hear from the Republicans? Nothing. You hear, let's put more money into the war in Iraq. Let's lengthen the time that the men and women fighting on our behalf spend there. Let's send them over there for more and more tours of duty. Do you ever hear anything from that side of the aisle in terms of an agenda, in terms of getting anything done? All I hear is ``no.'' All I hear is, ``not going to do that.'' All I hear, again, is, ``Yes, Mr. President. Whatever you say, Mr. President.'' 
   Our criticism of them, Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan, if you remember, in the 30-Something Working Group in the 109th was that they were the bobblehead Republicans who did nothing more than shake their head up and down and do whatever the President said. And nothing has changed. Well, guess what. A year from now, which is just about a year from now, they will be called to account just like you said, Mr. Meek, and we will see just how many fewer Republicans there will be here that serve in this chamber, because I think the American people have had it up to here. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. If the gentleman will yield. What is clear here is there is a threat of panic running through the caucus on the other side of the aisle because we are up to 16 of their incumbent Members who have decided to bail and who recognize that the ship is listing and has been listing badly and is in danger of just completely going down. There doesn't appear to be any likelihood of the ship righting itself in the near future. They aren't expected and aren't expecting to get their act together and focus on an agenda that the American people support because they have been a one-note, tunnel-vision party for far too long. 
   So you have 16 that have decided to retire already, with, we are sure, more to come. It's just not surprising because they do not share the priorities of everyday working families, Americans who want the Congress to focus on a new direction and not give them more of the same.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 39, the Wasserman Schultz-Stearns resolution commending the University of Florida Fighting Gators for their victory in the 2006 Bowl Championship Series and for winning the national college football title. 
   Madam Speaker, after a hard-fought football season, the Florida Gators proved victorious on January 8 with a dazzling 41-14 triumph over the Ohio State University Buckeyes. 
   While many critics expressed doubt about the Gators' chances for victory, Florida's Congressional Delegation and all of the students, alumni and friends in the Gator Nation stood by the Orange and Blue. 
   Led by senior quarterback Chris Leak, the MVP of the game, and Florida's impenetrable defense, Florida Gators dominated the game when the stakes were the highest. 
   This season, as Florida's football program celebrated its 100th anniversary, the University of Florida made history by winning national titles in both men's basketball and football in the same season. 
   Congressman Stearns and I would like to extend special congratulations to Florida's head coach, Urban Meyer, who trained this football team to be the best in the country. 
   The Florida players, coaches, faculty, students and alumni all pulled together with hard work and dedication to help the team win. All of the student athletes are shining stars for the University, and deserve our highest praise. 
   The Gator Nation's academic reputation is stellar, our sports teams are number one, and our fans are like none other.

   Last year, when the Judiciary Committee was legitimately investigating the political purge of U.S. attorneys and conducting oversight into the politicization of the Justice Department, administration officials not only failed to turn over key documents after receiving subpoenas, they didn't even bother to show up to testify. 
   Madam Speaker, I am deeply frustrated by this administration's continued stonewalling and, frankly, the contempt that it has shown for Congress. As our former Republican colleague Congressman Mickey Edwards told our committee, the administration's actions have been outrageous and it continues to erode the separation of powers.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, 2 1/2 years ago, this body, during another congressional recess, debated and passed a bill that dealt with the right to privacy: the Terri Schiavo legislation. The Republican Congress shredded the right to privacy in the Constitution then, and many Members regretted their vote because they got home and faced their constituents that were aghast at what we had done. 
   This bill is far worse because it treads on all Americans' civil liberties and their right to privacy. It allows warrantless wiretaps with no prior court review. It allows the government to spy on Americans without suspicion of their wrongdoing. It allows the government to force telecommunication companies to conduct the eavesdropping. 
   We need to adopt a wiretap program that protects our constitutional rights. Do we trust this administration with respecting the privacy of Americans and not casting the widest net possible? When do we say ``this far and no farther''? 
   Voting for this bill lets the terrorists win. It lets them force us to choke off our citizens' rights. Americans want us, as they have repeatedly shown, to uphold the finest example of democracy and civil liberties the world has ever known. 
   Don't let the terrorists win. Vote against this bill. Adopt a surveillance program that protects our citizens and our rights.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I began my service in Congress fighting for the right to privacy. Above all else, Americans' ability to communicate without the fear of having the government tap their phones, listen to their conversations or intercept their private communication is a right that just cannot be discarded. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle have said if an American is not communicating with a terrorist, then they have nothing to fear. The manner in which the administration has conducted the warrantless surveillance program has undermined our citizens' confidence in the bedrock belief that we live in a free country where we do not live in constant fear of the government looking over our shoulder. 
   This is a cherished right that has been arrogantly cast aside by an administration run amok. After a careful review of both classified and unclassified materials concerning the administration's warrantless wiretapping program, I, like so many of my Judiciary Committee colleagues, concluded that the immunity that is proposed by the administration is unnecessary and goes too far. 
   We must be vigilant when protecting our citizens' right to privacy. It is a rare, unique, and important right that we cannot allow to be subjected to death by a thousand cuts. If the administration has its way and this right falls, what is next? We must stand in the breach and make sure that Americans' right to privacy is preserved. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity that has been given to us by Speaker Pelosi tonight to talk about an issue that is affecting literally millions of families across America, and that is the lack of affordable child care and early childhood education. It is especially important to highlight these issues as this week marks the Week of the Young Child. 
   For the next hour, we're going to focus on young children and how, over the last 7 years, we have failed to provide adequate and necessary funding for vital child care and early childhood education. 
   And I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that as a mother of three young children--I have 8-year-old twins and an almost 5-year-old, 4 1/2 -year-old little girl--this is something that is near and dear to my heart. 
   I remember the struggle that I went through when I first gave birth to my twins and had to go back to work, and we searched and searched for a quality child care program. We were turning our newborn babies, 3 months old, 4 months old, over to really, basically, someone we didn't know, someone to care for our little ones all day long. You know, we just couldn't even imagine turning over the care of our babies, our most precious resource, we couldn't imagine turning over our babies to anyone. 
   So you can imagine the struggle that people go through when, on top of having to decide where they can take their children to be cared for while they work, that they also have to struggle through the angst of not knowing or not expecting that they can afford that care. And because we have continued to slash and burn from this administration the funding for Head Start and for the Child Care Development Block Grants programs, we absolutely wanted to come to the floor tonight and spend an hour, at least an hour, highlighting the needs that children in this country have, and particularly those of working families. And I'm going to be joined tonight by several of my colleagues. 
   Before we begin, though, I do want to recognize and thank our good friend, Chairman George Miller of the Education and Labor Committee, and Chairman Kildee, Dale Kildee, for their leadership and their commitment to child care issues and education, as well as the Head Start and Child Care Development Block Grant Program funding. These are all programs that are near and dear to their hearts, and a number of these Members have submitted statements. 
   We just have to highlight that there are children, especially those from low-income families, that need better access to high-quality early childhood programs. Across the Nation, Madam Speaker, child care fees average from $4,000 to $10,000 per year which exceed the cost of public universities in most States. Yet nationally, only one in seven children who are financially eligible for child care subsidies is being served. One in seven. 
   And at this time, I would like to turn the podium over to a champion for America's children, the voice in this body that is consistently there for those who have no voice. She is the current Chair of the Woman's Caucus, Congressman Lois Capps of California.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I thank Congresswoman Capps. You have just been an incredible leader on the issues that are important to women and young families, and it is so incredibly important in this Week of the Young Child that we have a leader like Congresswoman Capps, the Chair of the Women's Caucus, who has been such a stalwart on the issues that are important to young women and families; and it's just a pleasure to have her join us on the floor today. 
   It is also a pleasure to have such a committed and passionate and compassionate father serving in the House of Representatives with us from Pennsylvania, a wonderful father of two young daughters and someone who has done an incredible job since he's joined the Congress after the 2006 election, Congressman Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. And thank you for your leadership and for giving your time in public service to make sure that the next generation is well represented here in the halls of Congress. 
   It is incredibly important and so beneficial to the issues important to working families to have parents of young children serving in the Congress, having moms and dads who are living and dealing with these issues every day. We've got to make sure that we have their voice represented strongly in this House of Representatives. 
   And now it's my privilege to turn the mic over to my good friend who represents the beautiful islands of Hawaii, the gentlewoman from Hawaii, Mazie Hirono.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, to continue on with the highlighting of the Week of the Young Child, there are statistics that are incredibly important, and I will go through some of those this evening. But more important than the statistics and the studies are the stories. And I can tell you, as a mom with young children, who I probably will talk about quite a bit this evening, you don't need studies, you don't need statistics to be able to see the progress that your child makes when they go through a preschool, when they go through a childcare program. And you can see their brain literally working like sponges, absorbing the information and processing it and turning it into useful information. And I can tell you that I've seen my children, my four-and-a-half-year-old is still in pre-K and is just about to enter Kindergarten next year. And I've watched her learn her ABCs, she can count to 100, she knows every color, every shape. And had she not had an opportunity to go to a wonderful preschool program to learn those things, yes, I could have spent time with her and taught her those things, but given that I work full-time, and when I think about the hundreds of thousands, millions of parents who have to struggle with that choice, and then an administration that callously cuts those programs or flat funds them so that fewer, not more, parents have access to Head Start and child care, it's just absolutely unconscionable. I wonder if they have a soul. I wonder if there is anyone in the White House that has a soul and that has a heart. Because surely those kinds of decisions are only made by heartless people. 
   I am so glad to be joined by the gentlewoman from New York, a wonderful Member, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke. And I am glad that she has also joined me tonight. 
   Before I turn it over to her, I want to highlight a story of Jennifer from Chicago because, like I said, highlighting the stories as opposed to the studies and the stats is what really shows you the kind of impact that the policy decisions that we make up here when it comes to funding child care programs and Head Start adequately, that's what really matters. 
   I want to talk about Jennifer from Chicago, who was profiled in a news story on Marketplace radio. Jennifer works as a receptionist at a real estate company. She is a single mom working full-time and going to school part-time. And so many people will hear their own story in Jennifer's story. 
   Jennifer was doing all she could to improve her life and the life of her daughter. In fact, even though Jennifer was working full-time, raising her daughter on her own and going to school part-time, she impressed her boss so much with her work that she was given a small raise. And then, Jennifer ran into a big problem. With the raise that she got, she could no longer qualify for assistance with the Illinois child care program that she had been using. She literally had such a dramatic shift in what she had to pay for her daughter's child care, it went from $2,000 to $9,000 a year just by that small increase in her salary, and that small increase in her salary caused the $9,000 that she then had to pay, that was 40 percent of her salary, just from the small raise that she got. Her only option at that point was to send her 5-year-old daughter to live with the girl's father a couple of hours away in Indiana. So she had to either give up her job or give up her daughter. But if she gave up her job, she wouldn't be able to care for her daughter, Mr.  Speaker. So obviously this is a situation that was not working. 
   So Jennifer, this is just so sad, she had to go back to her boss and actually ask him for a demotion. She had to ask him to cut her pay by about $100 per paycheck so that she could be eligible for the subsidized child care again so that she could get her daughter back. That was the choice that she was faced with, and it was just awful. I can't even imagine. That meant that her income would again qualify for the child care assistance, and then she immediately applied for it. 
   So the transition from paying a copayment to paying the full cost of care is what Illinois Action for Children calls ``the cliff.'' People like Jennifer, they fall off the cliff. And we actually penalize people like Jennifer who work hard to try to get ahead. We tell them no, you can't work your way up. 
   We can't continue to hold these people back. We have got to make sure that we help these people pursue these dreams, advance themselves, be able to improve the quality of their children's education, improve their own lot in life and their family's lot in life, not give them a choice between giving up their children or pursuing a better opportunity in life. 
   And Ms. Clarke, the National Women's Law Center says that only one in seven U.S. children are eligible for Federal child care help; only one in seven of those kids get it. And in the view of the National Women's Law Center, all these programs for Head Start and child care have never been fully funded by the Federal Government. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentlewoman. Thank you for joining us today.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Reclaiming my time, you made a reference to your mom and the wonderful quality of care that she provided to the children that she cared for over the years. And then, of course, she made hiring decisions as she moved up the ladder and became a child care director. Your comments about your mom's involvement with improving the lives of children in those programs made me think about finding the information on providers' salaries because it is horrendous that we are actually cutting the funding for these programs for the kids themselves and that only one in seven kids are eligible. But listen to the statistics about how much the providers, the teachers, are actually paid: 
   The average Head Start teacher's salary, and, now, that's Head Start, not child care. We are talking about two separate programs here tonight so that people understand me because these acronyms get thrown around a whole lot in Washington. We have the Head Start program, which is the high-quality education program that subsidizes and provides high-quality preschool education for young kids who are income eligible, and then there's the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which is a subsidized child care program that is funded around the States and there's a Federal-State match for. 
   So the average Head Start teacher's salary varies by the teacher's education. So if you have what's called a child development associate's, which is the first rung on the ladder in terms of an education credential, not a certified teacher but you have a lot of hours of course work that you've taken, an average Head Start teacher with a CDA gets paid about $21,000. If you have an associate's degree, so now you've got a 2-year college degree, you get $22,500. If you have a baccalaureate degree, that is a full-blown college degree, you make about $27,000 in the Head Start program. Now, the average teacher's salary, who also get hired with a baccalaureate degree, is about $48,000, $49,000. So a Head Start teacher, depending on their education credential, makes between $21,000 and $27,000 a year. I mean that is just unbelievable.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Absolutely. And I want to thank you so much for coming down and joining me tonight. 
   What we have been trying to do is highlight the consequences to these horrendous policymaking decisions. And I talked about Jennifer a few minutes ago and what her situation is like. Some of my colleagues from the various States that are represented on this chart mentioned their own States' statistics this evening. But I want to give a fuller picture of what the real consequences are to not funding adequately Head Start and Child Care and Development Block Grants. So this is what it looks like in my State, Ms. Clarke: In my State of Florida, nearly 45,000 children are standing in line for child care. In other words, we have got almost 45,000 kids in my State who are eligible for child care, but they can't get it because we're not funding it adequately, I mean simply because we are not providing enough funds. 
   I mean what are we spending it on? What is more important? Like you said, the gentleman that you said says the same refrain every single time, ``remember the children,'' that's what it is all about. 
   I remember being pregnant with my twins and people telling me throughout my pregnancy, Oh, Debbie, you're life is going to change. Just wait. You're not going to believe it. You never imagined that you could care about something so much as when you give birth to your kids. And you sort of nod and smile, and you tell them, sure, you can imagine what it's going to be like. Well, you can't imagine. You can't imagine what it's going to be like until you have them. And that's what everybody tells you. You can't imagine that you could care and love something more than when you give birth to your children. And you would do anything to make sure that they were okay, that they had the best possible life that they could have. 
   And when parents who are struggling to make sure that they can put food on the table, that they can pay the mortgage, not have the house foreclosed on, make sure that they can have time to go to their job, but, at the same time, have a high-quality child care situation so that they don't have to worry about the one or two or three or however many kids they have that they care more about than anything in the world, what it is this administration doing? Cutting the funding for our most precious resource. 
   So it's not just Florida. It's not just New York. There are 207,000 kids in California on a waiting list. 
   How about Georgia? Georgia, Ms. Clarke, that actually has a pre-K program funded by the lottery, which is supposed to provide a pre-K education to all the 4 year olds in that State, and there are only 6 million people in the State of Georgia as it is, there are 24,808, almost 25,000 kids on the waiting list for child care that they qualify for. In North Carolina almost 18,000 kids are on the waiting list, 15,000 in Texas, 207,000 in California. Those are kids that don't have access to child care who are eligible.     
   Nationwide, it is 365,604 children who are waiting in line for child care. And what do those parents do? What do they do? They have to choose between working. If they don't work, how are they going to put food on the table? How are they going to be able to live? Many of these parents have to choose between whether they are going to be able to hold on to their children or not. The angst that I feel in my heart even thinking about having to make a choice like that. There is no one that should have to make that choice. And that the government, their own government, would deprive them of the ability to care for their kids is just mind-boggling.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Absolutely. And let's show people what we mean. And I know you have seen this information before. What we are talking about, when you describe the difference between a parent who can't decide to bring their child to a child care program because there is no money, they can't afford to pay for it, the Federal Government is slashing the funding for it so they don't have a slot funded for their child, even though they are eligible, what happens, like you said, is that you have the parents who can afford it when those kids get to public school, they have already been through several years of prekindergarten, and they arrive at school and start kindergarten at 5 years old ready to learn, which is what the goal of Head Start and these child care programs is. The Federal funding that we provide is designed to make sure those children get to school ready to learn. 
   And this is the correlation of funding from the Federal Government for child care and Head Start and brain development. We are literally funding it in the opposite direction from the way the brain grows and develops and when we provide funding. So here is when you have the most brain growth, and the most rapid brain growth and the most important point in a child's life for that brain growth, and we are funding it the most when we are well beyond the points that the child's brain  growth has not ceased, but certainly when it has slowed. 
   This chart should be inversed. We should be funding the highest percentage when the child's brain is developing at its earliest point between birth and 5 years old. But we are doing the opposite. It makes absolutely no sense. It really boggles my mind. 
   And that hurts. We are talking about real kids. I brought pictures of real children who are impacted by these decisions because I think we have to remember what we are talking about here. So often when we have discussions on the floor here, it becomes easy to become desensitized to the fact that we are talking about real people. These are real children who are being cared for. And I am going to tell their story in a little bit. But look at these beautiful children. And this is their caregiver. And I'm going to tell their story in a couple of minutes. But I just don't think it can be forgotten that every funding cut, every decision we make like this affects one of these precious babies. And I just can't even imagine how there is no heart in the White House. Although I shouldn't be shocked after almost 8 years of this administration. It is just unbelievable. We have got to make sure, and the reason that we are here tonight during the Week of the Young Child, is we have to make sure that we push in the next fiscal year, in fiscal year 2009, for an increase in Child Care and Development Block Grant funding the Head Start program. And Democrats have been fighting to make sure that we do that. We passed a wonderful Head Start bill. We have got to make sure that we reverse the lost ground that has occurred after 7 years of flat funding from this administration.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is the difference, literally, it's like when a baby is born, particularly to a working family that is not rolling in cash, that is literally struggling to put together their paychecks every month to meet their family's needs, it's like that baby's life begins on a crossroads. And we hold the key to which path they will end up on. 
   If we decide, like this administration, like the Bush administration has consistently decided during their time in office to cut the funding for child care, subsidized child care and for Head Start, then we are, not always, because there are kids that avoid it, but we are making it much more likely that the path that those kids travel down end up sending them more likely into a life of crime, potentially into an inability or decision not to graduate from high school. They end up dropping out. They make the wrong choices because they don't learn at the earliest stage how to make the right choices. They don't learn the basics. They don't have all the tools that they need to draw upon to be strong, to deal with life's challenges. This is not 
   exaggeration. This is real.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is. And it's hard to imagine what's more important. Should we continue to spend $14 million an hour in Iraq? Fourteen million dollars an hour is what we are spending in Iraq. Yet we can't come up with the funding that we need to make sure that all the kids in this country that are eligible for Head Start and for subsidized child care can actually go.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is unbelievable. So we are choosing to lock kids like that up and spend more money, much more money, than we would spend on them up front to make sure that they get the education and the early start and the building blocks for success that are so much less expensive, but are also just the right thing to do. But for the accident of your birth you should not be in a situation where some kids are getting those basics and other kids are thrown to the wolves. We have these programs so that we can equalize the situation in life for Americans. 
   Look, we live in a capitalistic society. And that is absolutely the economy that we all support and know and revere. And it has served us well through more than 200 years. But because we live in a capitalistic society, it does not mean that we should be throwing our children, our most vulnerable, to the wolves but for the accident of their birth.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You're absolutely right. I want to tell another story and highlight the impact on another family. We talked about the Head Start program. There are also child care providers who provide wonderful service in those subsidized child care programs. And we have had frozen Child Care and Development Block Grant funding that has led to stagnant and even decreasing reimbursement rates for providers who care for those children receiving subsidies. 
   In 2006, only nine States paid reimbursement rates that were on par with what the Federal Government recommends. And one of those results is there's an alarming 35 percent turnover  rate for child care providers because they can't afford to continue to work in that field. 
   And I want to tell the story of a young woman named Kelly Matthews. Kelly is a child care provider in Iowa City, Iowa. I want to read you Kelly's story in her own words, because this is how she described her situation. 
   She said, ``You and I share something important in common. We both go to work each day with a grounded, deeply held belief that we do our chosen work for one very simple reason, to change the world.'' 
   And I know how many times I have said that the reason I do this job is to make the world a better place and to change the world. Kelly is right here with her kids in her program. 
   She said, ``I don't work in the Halls of Congress, but in my home, caring for children in my Child Development Home in Iowa City. What other reason, aside from wishing to impact the future, could motivate someone to take on a job with modest pay, no benefits and no paid time off? This isn't about a `job' for me. This is my profession, my chosen life's work. And it is an amazing gift I am given each day to partner with the families I serve.     
   ``I have built my childcare program around the ideas of community, caring for each other, and falling in love with learning. I love this work because I have carefully crafted a program where kids succeed in all these areas in amazing ways: When Claire (at 18 months) already knows how to comfort a friend, when Trae (at 5 years old) can easily count and set out the right number of plates for his friends at the lunch table, when Lexi (at 3 years old) works hard to write the names of the members of her family, when Gus (at 3 years old) knows how to care for his things and the things that belong to others, or when two toddlers are already capable of working out a conflict in a peaceful way without an adult's intervention,'' what I wouldn't give for that in my house, ``I know these children will be ready, not only for school, but just as importantly, for life. They will grow into adults that know how to take responsibility for themselves and how to care for others, how to problem solve and be creative in their endeavors, how to keep on trying, even when it is tricky.'' 
   She said, ``I take this work seriously. Approximately 50 hours a week of my time with children in my home, plus all the additional hours of paperwork, supply shopping, continuing education, networking with my colleagues, and add to that total, developing and presenting hours of training to inspire other family childcare providers to constantly improve themselves and their programs. But for those of us committed to our professions and our vision of an inspired word, it is all in a day's work, isn't it?'' 
   That is what Kelly Matthews, this wonderful woman with all her children in her program around her, had to say about her work, and it is the reason that we are standing here on the floor tonight at the beginning of the Week of the Young Child. 
   I am so pleased that you have been able to join me, Ms. Clarke, and I turn it over to you to close us out.

   Mr. Speaker, we think we have made a very strong case tonight at the beginning of the Week of the Young Child to make sure that there is a mandate for this Congress to increase the funding for Head Start, increase the funding for Child Care and Development Block Grants, and make sure that when those little babies are put on the crossroads of the path of their life, that we send them strongly down the right path so that they can have the best life that they can possibly have.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Altmire, I want to tell a little story because I am really pleased that you raised this issue, and that you have been the champion of ensuring that we don't, as we move through what is an unfortunate but necessary situation with this continuing resolution, I want to tell anyone listening a little story about an exchange that you and I had the other day on the House floor. 
   I have the privilege of serving as a Chief Deputy Whip for the House Democratic Caucus, and you are one of my assignments. We divide the House Democratic Caucus members up into groups, and you are included among the Members that I am typically engaged in lobbying. And when I approached you about whether you were going to be supportive of the continuing resolution that we voted on today, your immediate response, which was the right one, was, well, not if we are cutting money for veterans. And I was really proud that you did that and that you were absolutely not going to move forward on your support for the continuing resolution unless you were able to get the information that you needed to ensure that, in fact, not only were we not cutting funding for veterans but, we in fact, increased funding for veterans. And so the notation in your hometown paper was apt and appropriate, and I commend you for your advocacy because that is what this is all about. 
   The new direction that the American people demanded, that they chose on November 7 included selecting people like you to send to Washington to make sure that when there was no one standing up, we certainly were all standing up united as a minority; but that there were not enough people in this body standing up for veterans. On the contrary, as you just outlined through the charts in a chronological way, the Republicans and the Republican administration were doing the opposite, were actually making it more difficult for veterans to get the services that they need and that they were entitled to and that they deserved through their patriotism and devotion to this country. So I commend you on that. 
   We were in a situation in adopting the continuing resolution today that was the result of the mess, as you said, that the Republicans handed us. I mean, how irresponsible to just not complete nine of the 11 appropriations bills. I sit on the House Appropriations Committee now. I am just at the beginning of that process, but it is mind boggling to me, how, really, I mean, the Constitution says the only thing we have to do, the only thing Congress has to do is pass the budget. And they didn't do it. They didn't do it because it is hard. It is difficult. You have to make tough decisions. And you know, right up in front of an election, where they were struggling as it was, they didn't want to make those difficult decisions. And we have a lot of our Members, some in tough districts that are going to have to go home and have to answer some difficult questions, because obviously, you know, we didn't like everything that we had to do. But if we didn't go forward and try to get to the 2008 budgetary process and make sure we could do right by the people in this country, then we would have been in an even worse mess. 
   So kudos to you for standing up for veterans and for adding another voice on their behalf where there wasn't one before. 
   And if the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) wanted to jump in I would be happy to yield to him.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Altmire, let me just jump in while the gentleman from Florida is listening, because one of the things I think it is important to point out is when we talk in the language of government, it is difficult for regular folks to understand what we are saying. So we are talking about the CR, the continuing resolution, the terminology that we deal with on a daily basis. But that is not what sort of every day folks understand. 
   And the continuing resolution, it is important to point out, is the budget, the Federal budget that keeps the lights on. And people will recall a number of years ago when the Republican Congress decided that, in retaliation for who knows what, because they couldn't get the Clinton administration to agree to what they wanted, because they thought that brinksmanship was the most appropriate strategy, they shut the government down. People were furloughed. Government programs that were vitally important to different constituencies around the country came to a halt. 
   What we have done is, and Chairman Obey has been the champion of this. What we have done is, not only have we made sure that that doesn't happen, because brinksmanship and engaging in irresponsible actions like that make no sense, we have made some difficult decisions. But we haven't made irrational decisions that would be harmful to people. 
   For example, we could have passed a continuing resolution that simply adopted the 2006 spending levels, the same spending levels that we had in 2006 and just moved forward. But that would have resulted, as you pointed out for veterans, in some cuts. And in our discussion on the floor the other day, you pointed out that unless there were increases, essentially, because of inflation, because of the adjustments in cost of living that are necessary, and because there are simply more people, more service men and women who are in need, we would not have had the money we needed to meet the needs of veterans. 
   But beyond that, let me just talk about what, because our good friends on the other side of the aisle are, of course, being critical that we didn't just pass a straight continuing resolution. Let's talk about what that would have done. Essentially, that would have jeopardized our national security. If we did that, if we simply passed the same level budget that we adopted in 2006, that would have resulted in thousands of layoffs, cuts for health care workers, cuts for members of the Armed Forces, cuts for veterans. 
   For example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service would face a month of furloughs. Can you imagine a month of furloughs in the Food Safety and Inspection Service? That means that we could end up with rotting meat in supermarkets and people potentially buying them. Or let's not use language that is too strong. Questionable meat. I mean, if we don't make sure that we have our food inspected, then we are going to jeopardize people's health. That would have also resulted in the closure of 6,000 meat processing plants that could not have been inspected. 
   The Federal Judiciary would have had to fire 2,500 workers. The Small Business Administration, and Mr. Meek, this is incredibly important to our area because how often we face natural disasters through hurricanes. But the Small Business Administration's disaster loan assistance program, which provides back up for FEMA's individual assistance program, that would have been run dry by the end of February. 
   Now, given how many people are still suffering from the aftermath of Katrina and Rita and Wilma and the other hurricanes and the other natural disasters that have hit around this country, I just cannot imagine what the consequences would have been. Actually, I can imagine what the consequences would have been for millions of Americans. 
   So we struck a balance here. We were being fiscally responsible, but at the same time, not hanging Americans out to dry without regard for their well-being. And that is what the Democratic Caucus's approach always is. You have to think about the fact that all of the decisions that we make here, Mr. Altmire and Mr. Murphy and Mr. Meek, affect real people. 
   I have often thought over the time I have served in the Congress and in the State Legislature in Florida, in Florida, and I am not sure how far your State capital is in Connecticut from your home, Mr. Murphy, but Tallahassee is 450 miles from where I live. And I served in the State Legislature for 12 years. Mr. Meek, I think, served in the State Legislature for 10, between the House and the Senate. It is so easy, I mean, we are obviously even further away from our homes, I certainly am. But you are pretty far from your homes, too, making decisions in Washington. And it could be argued that it would be so easy to make decisions in a vacuum here. The people we affect, whose decisions that we make, who we affect, they can't come in this Chamber. They are not in the room with us. The folks in the gallery are that are watching, but it would be so easy to just forget that every decision, every vote, every time we put our card in that slot and our name lights up on the board ``yea'' or ``nay,'' the decision we make affects a human being.     
   But you become desensitized to it. There is a danger that you could become desensitized to it. Certainly the Republican side of the aisle became desensitized to it. For years and years, they didn't think about the results, they didn't think about the consequences. Well, that is the balance the Democrats strike. Pragmatism with a healthy dose of thoughtfulness and compassion. That is what it is all about.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. You know, just the way you are going back and forth on the Republican's response to the process, you know, it is just really, gosh, I can't say what comes to mind. It is galling. It really is galling that they do have nerve to talk about process. 
   Because just in my 2 years of experience, and certainly two wrongs don't make a wrong, but there is no second wrong here. I mean, in my experience in the last 2 years, and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek, you have had more experience and more lengthy experience than I and Mr. Altmire and Mr. Murphy have had, but I recall votes being held open for 40 minutes to several hours to twist enough arms to get the votes. We, of course, haven't had to do that because not only do we get all of our Members to vote for our legislation, but we get a good chunk if not, and in one case, a majority of theirs. 
   I remember being shut out, completely shut out on every major question over the last 2 years, no amendments allowed, no commentary except in a token way. And now they are whining about process? 
   You know, the small point I wanted to make, and Mr. Altmire, you are a dad, you have young kids; I am a mom, I have young kids; Mr. Meek has young kids, and some day Mr. Murphy and Mr. Ryan, I am sure you will have young kids too. 
   But you know, when your kids whine at you and complain about something that you know is just their immaturity, their wishing something could be the case, but when they get a little older they will realize that they were wrong? That is what this is.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I think they should have their say. I really do. Going forward, when we hear legislation and get into the regular order, we have markups in committee hearings and legislation that Members file, we will do that. But we are still cleaning up their mess. 
   The Six in '06 agenda is an agenda of the major issues that the American people voted for us to come here and do that we offered as amendments. 
   We offered the minimum wage, we offered fully implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and through all of the other procedural attempts we made within the confines of their limiting us, we offered repealing the subsidies to the oil industry. 
   We offered legislation and amendments that would have the student loan interest rate and make higher education access more affordable. And they said no. They said no, no, no, over and over and over again. 
   Sorry, now it is our turn. It is time to implement the agenda that the American people asked us to. It is time to clean up their mess. 
   Mr. Ryan, going forward, I am all for what Speaker Pelosi has said that we will do, which is give them the most bipartisan House of Representatives that history has ever seen. But the mess has to be cleaned up before we can do that.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. If the gentleman would yield, I would like to interject on that point. 
   Because the funny thing, ironically funny, about what you are talking about, where we have an average of 62 Republicans supporting the Six in '06 agenda and 57 supporting the continuing resolutions appropriations bill today, the last 2 years, our experience, Mr. Ryan's, Mr. Meek's and my experience, is watching the Republican leadership wrench our colleagues's arms behind their back; and, in many cases, new Members replaced those Members. Those Members caved. Those Members either didn't vote their conscience. 
   We used to talk about, in the 30-something hour, about how it seemed they checked their consciences and their beliefs and their constituents' beliefs at the door. They would come here and allow themselves to be influenced by their leadership and vote differently in some cases than they publicly said they would vote. 
   I think that actually happened with your predecessor, Mr. Murphy.

   We had a culture of corruption hanging over this institution and over this Capitol, and we were able to adopt some ethics rules that make sure that we can restore the American people's confidence in their government again. That is what our freshman class on the Democratic side ran on. One of the issues that they ran on was making sure that they could inspire their constituents to believe in what we are doing here again.

I think your comments are a good segue to where we should close which is that the Congress has now finally reasserted our constitutional role to be a check, a check and a balance over the other branches of government, particularly over the executive branch in which that authority and oversight was completely ceded over the last 12 years. 
   I sit on the House Judiciary Committee. We had an oversight committee today on the presidential signing statement where the President, this President in particular more than any other President combined, has issued signing statements, his opinion and his interpretation of legislation which is really the judicial branch's responsibility, that he would just choose not to implement or implement in the way that he wanted to, a particular section of law, wholly inappropriate.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, just last week we learned that police arrested a senior executive at the National Children's Museum right here in Washington, DC, for distributing child pornography over the Internet. This headline floored me, but it is a good example of a problem that has gotten completely out of control. 
   The Internet has facilitated an exploding multibillion dollar market for child pornography. Tragically, the demand for this criminal market can only be supplied by graphic new images, and these can only be supplied through the sexual assault of more children. I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3845, the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2007. 
   This bill addresses an issue that is central to the goals of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and the New Direction Congress, and one that should be at the top of everyone's agenda, the protection of our children. Our children deserve a future that is healthy, prosperous, safe, and bright, but our children are vulnerable when they are on line. If this bill becomes law, we have the potential to save many thousands of children from sexual abuse and exploitation. 
   I want to start by thanking my friend and colleague, Joe Barton of Texas, for working with me on this bipartisan legislation, and for his counsel, his very good counsel, as the lead Republican sponsor of the bill. 
   In the last Congress, Congressman Barton, then the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, conducted a series of hearings on this topic. Not only did those hearings expose the dearth of Federal resources devoted to investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, but they also brought together an extraordinary group of parents who formed an organization called the Surviving Parents Coalition. In June of this year, I had the opportunity to visit with this very special group of parents. 
   When I sat down with Mark Lunsford, Erin Runnion, Ed Smart, Marc Klaas, Mary Kozakiewicz, and other founders of the Surviving Parents Coalition, I was not prepared for what they had to tell me. They shared with me their own horrific stories of how their children were abducted by sexual predators. As we all know, some of these children will never come home. As the mother of three young children myself, their stories broke my heart, and as a Member of Congress I felt compelled to act. 
   What surprised me most about these brave parents was their message about child pornography and child exploitation. What they said was this: If you  want to prevent predators from hurting other children like ours, the way to do that is to go back through the Internet and get them. 
   As we learned last month with the apprehension of a child predator in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the first time we have the technology and the evidence not only to find these predators, we have the technology to rescue their victims as well. A 2005 Justice Department study found that 80 percent of child pornography possessors have images and videos of children being sexually penetrated. Another 21 percent possess images of bondage, sadistic abuse, and torture. The children depicted in these photos are very young. Eighty-three percent of child pornography possessors have images of children younger than 12, and another 19 percent possess images of infants and toddlers. There are even Web sites that provide live pay-per-view rape of very young children. 
   Let me be clear. This is not about obscenity or pornography; these images are crime scene photos, created by a thriving industry that uses children as a sexual commodity.     
   I want to thank Chairman John Conyers for holding a hearing on Internet predators in October. At that hearing, Special Agent Flint Waters of the Wyoming State Police, a highly respected child exploitation investigator, testified that right now there are nearly 500,000 identified individuals in the United States trafficking child pornography on the Internet. That's half a million people right here in the United States. And law enforcement knows who they are, and they know where they are. 
   But what shocked me the most and what compelled me to get involved in this issue is that, due to a lack of resources, law enforcement is investigating less than 2 percent of these known 500,000 individuals. Less than 2 percent. 
   What was even more shocking is that it is estimated that if we were to investigate these cases, we could actually rescue child victims nearly 30 percent of the time. 
   It is clear that our current efforts are not working. We need a national campaign with everyone joining the fight: that means the full weight of law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Congress, the executive branch, parents and victims advocacy groups and Internet service providers. 
   Alicia Kozakiewicz, whose testimony at the October Judiciary hearing moved us all, is a living, breathing reminder of the lives that we can save. Alicia is not just a victim; she is a survivor. 
   Alicia told us how over a period of months she was groomed by a 45-year-old predator pretending to be a teenage girl. When Alicia, who was 13 years old at the time, agreed to meet her cyberfriend in real life, he kidnapped her from her suburban Pittsburgh driveway and held her captive in his Virginia dungeon, where he performed unspeakable sexual acts upon her day after day and broadcast it over the Internet. Just when Alicia told us she had given up all hope, she was finally rescued by FBI agents. The FBI found her because the Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children task force, or ICAC, had the technology to lift the digital fingerprints of this perpetrator's crime and to discover the location where he held her captive, chained to the floor. 
   The PROTECT Our Children Act will help provide the safety net we so desperately need by creating statutory authority for these highly successful ICAC task forces which support State and local law enforcement agencies. It will supplement this local effort with hundreds of new Federal agents who will be solely dedicated to crimes against children. It will also provide desperately needed forensic crime and computer labs so agents can uncover troves of electronic evidence, locate these perpetrators, and bring them to justice. 
   Finally, the bill will create a special counsel within the Department of Justice who will be responsible for planning and coordinating our child exploitation prosecution efforts across the Federal agencies. 
   At the October Judiciary Committee hearing, a representative from the FBI told us two things, Mr. Speaker, that boggled my mind. First, he told us that the number of agents being exclusively assigned to these cases is actually shrinking; and, second, that they are giving millions of dollars that Congress has appropriated to combat child pornography to programs that have nothing to do with child protection. Should we be shrinking critical staffing power and diverting badly needed funds at a time when we are investigating less than 2 percent of known traffickers of child pornography? We can do better, and we must do better. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has come to reorder priorities at the Department of Justice, and the PROTECT Our Children Act will do just that. Our mandate here is clear: we must prevent predators from hurting our children. 
   Again, I want to thank Ranking Member Barton for his leadership, his concern, and his compassion for our children and their safety, not just on this issue but on the Pool Safety bill that we worked together in the 109th and the 110th Congress, and I truly appreciate his leadership and effort on this bill and many others. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is what Congress can do when we come together in a bipartisan fashion. And maybe it's our children that can be the catalyst for the change that we need in America. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Just in response to Mr. Goodlatte regarding the Special Counsel, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton). Special Counsel is an essential element to this legislation because right now you have no less than eight different entities and agencies that have something to do with the grants and the coordination and the prosecution and the pursuit of child exploitation crimes and particularly child pornography. 
   It is imperative that we have a single go-to entity, a single leadership position in the Department of Justice to ensure that there is someone who is responsible to Congress for the accountability, for the coordination, to make sure that it is elevated to the highest level of priority at the Department of Justice where clearly right now it is not. 
   And I again want to thank my colleague Mr. Barton for working with us on this legislation. This is an issue that transcends party. It is an issue that transcends process. When you have 500,000 known individuals out there pursuing our children on-line, Internet predators, any of our children could fall victim just by a click of the computer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you I have a 4-year-old who goes on-line with the most basic of Web sites, and you just never know, and we need to make sure that we have a massive effort to coordinate and put resources into going after child exploitation and child predators.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I met Lilly Ledbetter during the House Judiciary Committee hearing last month. At that time, she explained how she was repeatedly harassed during her 20-year career at Goodyear. Lilly Ledbetter described for us in Judiciary how she had no proof of pay discrimination until someone anonymously slipped payroll records into her mailbox. Now, as much as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to wish it to be otherwise, until a few months ago, it was established law that each paycheck constitutes a discriminatory act under the law. 
   When they were confirmed, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito promised to follow precedent. They promised to practice judicial restraint. Instead, they rewrote the law and pushed an activist, conservative agenda. They denied Lilly Ledbetter justice. 
   In the real world, discrimination is subtle and takes years to become evident. However, Justice Alito ruled that victims have only 180 days after a discriminatory decision has been made to file suit, even if that employee would have no way of knowing about it. This standard is impossible to meet. The opponents of this bill expect employees to be clairvoyant. 
   Many companies intentionally prohibit their employees from comparing salaries and pay raises, and this decision will allow employers to shield discriminatory practices. 
   The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act rights this wrong. It clarifies that an employee is discriminated against each and every time she receives an unfair paycheck, and I'm surprised at my colleagues, particularly my female brethren on the other side of the aisle, who are standing in front of this House and asking the House to continue and repeat the practice of discrimination against women who have been unfairly treated for years and years.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I also want to add my voice and sorrow that goes out to the Davis family. Mr. Meek, Mr. Murphy, this is also Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Since we know that our dear colleague, Mrs. Davis, succumbed to breast cancer after a valiant 2-year battle, I think it is important to note that we are in Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
   Breast cancer affects so many women from so many different walks of life, and it strikes every potential family, whether you're a Member of Congress, a maintenance worker, whether you're a scientist or someone from any walk of life. It is important that we focus our research and our effort, our dollars, our passion and our commitment to finding a cure for this horrendous disease. My prayers and thoughts go out to her family as well. 
   Madam Speaker, that having been said, I do have to tell you that I go back to my district and have talked to lots of different groups at home and in various places around the country, and when I bring up the possibility of the fact that President Bush might, and then did, veto a bill that would expand access to health care to 10 million kids, people really look at me like we must be working with aliens from another planet. Really. The jaws drop open, the puzzled look on people's faces in the audiences that I speak in front of, when I tell them that most of the Republicans and this President are actually opposed to expanding access to children's health care. 
   Now, they will say they are not. They have been saying, no, no, we support it. But words are pretty hollow when it comes to a mom or a dad whose child is suffering with a fever and they have no health insurance, which means they can't call up a doctor like we can and make an appointment to have a simple checkup or to get some antibiotics, and that they have to wait until their child is so sick, until that temperature climbs to about 104, 105, until you're ready to push the panic button, fly in your car, if you have a car, if you have a way to get yourself to the emergency room, to take your child to the emergency room to use it as your primary health care access. 
   People get that this is simple: You are either for making sure that kids have health care, or you're not. The lame excuse that they use, Mr. Meek and Mr. Murphy, is that they try to tell people that this is covering kids whose parents can afford insurance already, or who are already covered. They actually say that there are people that will drop the health insurance that they are paying for privately now to sign up for SCHIP; that that is exactly what any right-minded parent would do, is drop comprehensive health care coverage that they already have so that they can hopefully qualify for and keep their child qualified for a health insurance program that is really targeted for kids who fall in the gap. 
   Madam Speaker, not only is that completely wrong, it's a shell game designed to take away the focus that is clearly being shined on them right now, that shows that we are for children and they are not. That is the bottom line. It is very simple. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a simple choice coming up next Thursday, October 18. They can stand with the kids and make sure that kids who fall in the gap, who don't qualify for Medicaid, whose families aren't poor enough to qualify to get them Medicaid, and whose families can't afford to buy private health insurance, the gap of those kids in the middle, we need to make sure we cover them. It's the bottom line, Mr. Murphy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. There are different ways to talk about this issue. As a mom, I like to talk about it from the standpoint when I talk to other parents that there is pretty much nothing more basic, no more guttural reaction that a parent has than wanting to keep their child healthy. Everywhere I go when I talk to people, this is the most basic thing. It is as simple and as black and white and as big a no-brainer as most people have ever come across. 
   A lot of the issues we deal with up here are complex. They are not black and white necessarily. There is a lot of gray. There is no gray on whether or not, if we can cover 10 million kids, we should. There is no gray for most folks. If that is the case, and I am certain that is the case in my liberal Democratic district, as opposed to conservative Republican districts or moderate Democrat/moderate Republican districts. I don't think there is any tinge of partisanship on the basic instinct that parents want to make sure they provide health care for their kids. 
   But if that is not the priorities that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle share, what is? Well, I think a glance at this chart will demonstrate what their priorities are. 
   This chart details 37 days in Iraq and what that would pay for if we were comparing it to what we could pay for to cover children's health care. 
   One day in Iraq costs $330 million in funds that we appropriate. That would cover, over the 5 years that this children's health insurance program would authorize, 270,222 children. 
   One week of paying for the war in Iraq costs $2.3 billion, which would cover 1,891,551 kids over the 5 years of this program. 
   A month of the war in Iraq, which we are now in the sixth year, I believe, costs $10 billion, and that would cover 8,196,721 kids over the 5 years that we would authorize this program. 
   And finally, over 37 days, which would be about 4 1/2 months' worth of paying for Iraq in the 5-year program, $12.2 billion, it costs us for 37 days in Iraq, that would cover the 10 million kids this program would cover. So 10 million kids times 5. 
   They have repeatedly voted to blindly follow President Bush, blindly follow President Bush on the war in Iraq, and now, except for 45 brave Republicans who understand that children come first, blindly follow him over a cliff and vote for $12.2 billion over 37 days in a given month and a week for the war in Iraq, and to continue it even though Americans want us to withdraw and refocus our efforts on homeland security here. And on top of that, choose to spend that money on a hopeless war as opposed to funding health care for 10 million kids. 
   Who is for children and who is just kidding? I think the numbers demonstrate that it is clear. They have an opportunity to right the wrong that the President's veto pen established last week. Next Thursday they can vote to override it, and the American people have been speaking and need to continue to speak to their Members who voted wrong on this bill. We need 15 more Republicans. We are this close, 15 Republicans. Grow some courage, see the wizard, toughen that spine or grow one. Vote to override the President's veto and 10 million children get health care coverage.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Murphy, this process we are going through in trying to win over the 15 Republicans kind of reminds me of the lessons my parents taught me when I was a little kid. You would struggle, Madam Speaker, with what was really right from wrong and to understand the values that your parents were instilling. I know I did. I would ask my mom on tough questions: How am I going to know I did the right thing? What is the guidepost I should use? That is the kind of lessons parents teach their kids all the time. 
   I remember so vividly my mom and dad telling me you have to be able to go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror and like what you see staring back at you. You have to know that your conscience is not going to gnaw at you. 
   There are plenty of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who will thump their chests and use a lot of bravado, false bravado, I would add, and say, I can live with myself. I am doing the right thing. But you know in your heart of hearts when you go to sleep at night and you are the only one in the room with yourself whether or not you have done the right thing. 
   I am desperately hopeful they will listen to that inner voice, because you know your inner voice has to be telling you, if they truly have the values that they say they have as opposed to the ones that are reflected in many of their votes, that they will do the right thing, at least 15 of them, and vote to override the President's veto. 
   We all remember the vivid picture that we had when history was made on January 4 this year when Speaker Pelosi was sworn in and handed the gavel with all of those children, the children of our colleagues and grandchildren, surrounding her at the roster. That was a very vivid picture, but that wasn't a photo op. That was a representation of what Speaker Pelosi has staked her speakership on. She dedicated her speakership to our Nation's children, and we are making our entire agenda about improving their lives and affecting and impacting their future. 
   I mean at the end of the day, like I said a couple of minutes ago, and it bears repeating, this is a black-and-white issue. You vote to override the President's veto, you are for expanding access to health care for 10 million children. If you vote no, you are against it, period. There is no other way to define it. 
   This is one of those things, Mr. Meek, the more they have to explain why they are doing what they are doing, the worse it gets for them. Again, I go back to standing in front of your constituents at a town hall meeting, and sometimes you look out at the  faces that we represent and you hope you are winning the audience over. But on this issue, those puzzled expressions don't go away the more words that come out of our colleagues' mouths in explanation of why they can't support expanding access to health care for 10 million children.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I'm so glad that you brought this up, because as a member of the whip team, I was working this debt collection bill that we passed on the House floor today, and I was just equally as shocked as you were about how many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against this because here are the facts. 
   Those private debt collection companies were costing us $70 million. We paid them $70 million of government funds to collect $20 million.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I will be glad to say it again. It's that shocking. We were paying private debt collection companies, instead of paying IRS employees a salary, to collect the debt that is owed in taxes from the people who have not been paying their taxes, $70 million to private debt collection companies to collect $20 million, and if we had spent the same $70 million, the statistics show that the track record of IRS employees paid the same amount of money would have collected $1.6 billion. $1.6 billion would have been collected by government employees working for the IRS who we have to presume are quite a bit more trustworthy with our constituents' private, personal information in this time of stolen identities and stolen funds from our constituents. 
   The thing that strikes me as the most disturbing about this is that the Republicans talk this good game about being fiscally responsible and being the ones that are the stewards of the public's tax dollars, and then let's go down the list of where our votes and our leadership has been as Democrats under Speaker Pelosi and where theirs have been. 
   There was this bill today. Do you have the numbers on how many Republicans voted against this bill today? Voted to continue the practice of spending $70 million to collect $20 million. 232 Democrat ``yes'' votes and 173 Republican ``no'' votes. Only 22 Republicans voted ``yes.'' I don't understand that. So maybe it's an isolated incident. Maybe it's isolated.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Again, for some more examples, Mr. Murphy, you came in the new freshman class or majority-makers who were committed to this campaign to come here and help move this country in a new direction. The new direction we have been talking about is eliminating the consistent examples of Republicans talking about being fiscally responsible but doing exactly the opposite. The next time we should bring the numbers of the votes to the floor on how many Republicans voted for the PAYGO rules and how many Democrats voted for it, how many Republicans voted against the amendment that closed the tax loophole that allowed American companies to hide how much they were supposed to pay in taxes by headquartering them in a different country even if they were really American companies doing business here. 
   In that energy bill, we put a provision in that energy bill to make sure we could close that loophole. I would like to see numbers here on how many Republicans voted against it, allowing companies to skirt their responsibility. This is not about increasing taxes. That vote was about collecting the taxes that are due, that these companies owe. 
   So no on PAYGO, no on closing tax loopholes, no on debt collection responsibility and leaving $50 million on the table. Who is fiscally responsible and who is just kidding?

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, in 1963 President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in order to address the wage gap, and yet 45 years later, more than my entire life, women still make on average only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men for the same work. 
   Last summer I had the opportunity to meet Lilly Ledbetter during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. When she worked for Goodyear, she had no proof of pay discrimination until someone anonymously slipped payroll records into her mailbox. When Lilly took her case to court, the Supreme Court failed her, telling her she should have known all along she was being discriminated against, even though Goodyear's payroll records were secret. This bill lifts the cloak of secrecy that allows these kinds of unfair pay practices to fester. 
   I urge my colleagues today to support eliminating discriminatory pay practices. Let's create an America where our next generation of daughters get paid for their worth equally, regardless of their gender. 
   My congratulations to Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Miller for their leadership on this issue. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a bold step forward in righting the wrong of pay discrimination.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Anyway, to get back to the matter at hand, Mr. Meek referred to the fact that the 30-something Working Group was probably expected to shrivel up and die, to blow away after we won the majority, to just not re-emerge because one might think that there was no point in our continuing to exist. However, because the United States Congress and because we believe Democrats are responsible in the leadership of this Congress for accountability, we absolutely need to make sure that we use multiple facets of opportunity available to us to hold people accountable. 
   We had an opportunity the last number of years to use this forum to hold our good friends on the other side of the aisle accountable, yet we still need to hold this administration accountable. And Lord knows that they certainly need it, as they continue to demonstrate every single day. 
   And I just want to move on a little past the whistleblower act and the 104 hearings that we have had on this war in Iraq that have been scheduled since we took over the leadership of this Congress to the Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney firings that occurred in the last 10 days or so. 
   I just came from a House Committee on the Judiciary meeting in which we adopted legislation that will ensure that we reassert the Congress', on the Senate side, role in confirming U.S. Attorneys and restore the check and balance that used to be in place before a provision was inserted in the dead of night by the Republicans in the conference committee without any committee reviewing it whatsoever. They completely changed the way the U.S. Attorneys were confirmed. They politicized that process without any Member being able to have the opportunity to debate it in the light of day. 
   And clearly we can see as a result of the actions of Attorney General Gonzales and the fact that he has chosen to throw a staff person under the bus rather than have the buck stop with him, seems to be a pattern in this administration, i.e. Scooter Libby. We need to make sure that Congress reasserts our oversight role, and that is exactly what we just did in the Judiciary Committee. 
   But let's just recap what happened with the U.S. Attorneys. Eight U.S. Attorneys were fired. Now, the U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President, and we certainly don't deny that. However, when asked, when an inquiry was made, as is the Congress' responsibility, as to why those eight U.S. Attorneys were fired, the answer that we got was, well, the eventual answer we got was that it was performance related. Well, of course the eight U.S. Attorneys took umbrage at that and some of them came forward and suggested that there were actually some lawmakers, our good friends on the other side of the aisle specifically, that called and inquired about the progress of cases against Democrats in their jurisdiction. And then coincidentally, a few weeks later those that had gotten called that weren't responsive enough seemed to have been let go. 
   Now, in the wake of all of this, in the wake of the Attorney General being less than factual in front of a committee of this body and in the wake of the clear difference in what he said and what actually happened, you have the chief of staff to the Attorney General who has resigned. Last week you had another individual responsible for overseeing the U.S. Attorneys resign. Now, they say that he was on his way out anyway. 
   But it is time, and thank God we are able to now exercise Congress' oversight role and make sure that we have some fairness, make sure that we have justice administered in the way that Americans expect it to be, and that we are not politicizing the Department of Justice or the legal process that U.S. Attorneys oversee in each of their jurisdictions. Without us pointing that out, it would normally have just been swept under the rug. The administration would have just tried to ride it out and weather the storm. But now that we have a Democratic Congress, they can't do that anymore.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Can I share a story with you? I know I have shared this with you before, but I think it's worth repeating. 
   Right before we debated the Iraq war resolution a couple of weeks ago, I took the opportunity to go to Walter Reed and visit our wounded soldiers, had a chance to meet with six or eight of the finest young men that I have ever encountered. One of them was a young man who suffered from an inexplicable illness and was recovering at Walter Reed. 
   When I met him, his wife and his 6 year-old little boy were there. The gentleman explained to me that he had been in the middle of his third tour of duty, and he had a 6 year-old little boy. Each tour was 1 year, 1 year. 
   Now, if you do the math, that means that he missed half of his little boy's life. The overwhelming sadness that came over me was almost too much to bear. I mean, this little boy was so sweet, his wife was so understanding, they were so committed to his dad's service, her husband's service. The little boy said to me, just spontaneously, you know, as 6 year-old little boys are, I have a 7 year-old little boy so I know, he spontaneously burst out, he knew his dad was supposed to finish his tour in August, and he was going to come home forever in August. We forget this is about families and people, and we are destroying the fabric of these families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I am so glad that you went through those benchmarks and stressed that these were the President's benchmarks that we used. The President, on January 10, outlined the benchmarks for success, that he felt were imperative that we need. 
   Those were that we must give the United States the authority to pursue all extremists, we must rein in the militias and have Iraqis step up to the plate to enforce security. They have to decide how their oil revenues are going to be distributed. That is a very important benchmark that has to be accomplished, and they have to pass reconciliation initiatives to keep their country together. Their country is essentially about to fall apart. They are in the midst of civil war and are absolutely at the breaking point. 
   Besides those benchmarks that we had in that supplemental that we passed out of the Appropriations Committee today, and besides the incredibly necessary emergency funding that the troops need and that our veterans need, we also put provisions in that legislation to make sure that our troops can catch their breath. 
   I referred to that soldier who I met in Walter Reed, whose little boy just wanted him to come home, and who had missed half his little boy's life. We have soldiers, many, many soldiers, who have completed three tours of duty, are about to go on their fourth, who are deployed for 365 days and then that deployment is extended. 
   The language we put in that bill ensures and says to the Army that they need to make sure that those deployments are not beyond 365 days.     
   The President can waive that provision by submitting a report to Congress detailing why that unit's deployment is in the interest of national security. But that is the kind of accountability that we are inserting to protect our troops, to make sure that the President certifies that that deployment, that extension is absolutely essential to protect national security, despite the assessment that the unit is not fully mission capable. 
   Our readiness is shot. We are spread so incredibly thin, and we are talking about the impact on human beings' lives. 
   How about the length of deployment? The language in our bill requires the Defense Department to abide by its current policy and avoid extending the deployment of units in Iraq in excess of the 365 days. We have to make sure that those units are fully mission capable, and the time between deployments is essential as well. 
   The Defense Department would be required to abide by, again, its current policy and avoid sending units back into Iraq before troops get the required time out of the combat zone and training time, 365 days for the Army, and 210 days for the Marines. And the President can also waive that provision in the interest of national security. He just has to certify to Congress that that is the case. 
   And that is the kind of accountability that the American people insisted upon on November 7. They asked us for a new direction, in the 6 in 2006 items of our agenda that we have already passed, and they insisted that we move this war in a new direction so that there would be an end in sight, so that the President would no longer have a blank check, and so that we could make sure we could protect our men and women in uniform who are protecting us. And I would be happy to yield to the gentleman. And I am going to have to take my leave of the gentleman because I have constituents that are in town that I need to speak with. I look forward to you carrying on

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frank for your hard work on the legislation, and with all due respect to the gentleman from Alabama, I can appreciate what you are saying about the Senate and our negotiations with them, but the Congress of the United States is not a unicameral institution.     
   The Founding Fathers created two Chambers, two bodies, and the opinions of this body are just as important as the opinions of the other body. And sending a strong message about the reset provisions and about the group life provisions for the policyholders that you say don't care about those provisions is why we have a bicameral Congress. 
   The other issue that I want to raise is that the life insurance fairness provision in this legislation, which you have strongly supported consistently, can stand on its own. It is not dependent upon group life being included in this legislation overall and it has no ties to that provision. 
   In the 109th Congress, we passed a bipartisan version of TRIA that included a provision that says that individuals will not be denied life insurance coverage based solely on where they might lawfully travel, and that is included in this provision again. Too often life insurance companies deny the applications of people who express the intent to travel internationally. That's particularly true when people say that they plan to travel to Israel because Israel and 26 other countries appear on the State Department's travel warning list. The life insurance industry is using the State Department's travel warning list as an underwriting tool. It was never intended to be an underwriting tool. Countries don't make that list based on an actuarial analysis. There are political and diplomatic considerations for those appearing on that list. Travel fairness language will protect consumers from unfair life insurance discrimination on the basis of past or future lawful travel, and this provision allows the insurers to price for risk according to an actuarial analysis. It's also fair to the insurance companies because it allows for denial based on war, serious health conditions in the country the person is traveling to, or fraud. 
   The freedom to travel is a right that we cherish, and no American should have to choose between their children's financial security and having the right to travel freely. And that is what we are forcing Americans to do if we don't pass this travel fairness language as a part of the reauthorization of TRIA. If we allow insurance companies to deny coverage based on the notion of where a person might travel, we are giving in to the terrorists who wish to change our way of life. 
   Life insurance companies have been using the State Department warning list as an underwriting tool. It was never meant to be utilized that way. I urge the Members to support the House-passed version of TRIA.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of Congressman Henry J. Hyde, the Representative of the Sixth District of Illinois from 1975 to 2007. Congressman Hyde was a distinguished and well-respected member of this body, serving for 32 years in the House of Representatives. 
   During his tenure, Congressman Hyde served honorably as the Chairman of the Judiciary and International Relations Committees and contributed much to this Nation. My thoughts and prayers go out to Congressman Hyde's family and friends during this difficult time. 
   While Congressman Hyde's accomplishments are many, I want to take a moment to share one that is both emblematic of the mark he left and of which I am particularly grateful. During the 109th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Congressman Hyde to help spur the creation of the first Jewish American Heritage Month. 
   As the lead Republican cosponsor of the House Resolution, Congressman Hyde was instrumental in garnering the support of the President of the United Sates and Republican leadership in the House, especially that of Speaker Hastert. 
   With support from around the country, the House and Senate passed resolutions in early 2006 urging the President to establish American Jewish History Month. President Bush then proclaimed the first Jewish American Heritage Month in May 2006 so that Americans could come together to celebrate the many contributions that Jews have made to the fabric of our society. 
   Thanks to Congressman Hyde's commitment and dedication, American Jewish culture and heritage is now celebrated each May by our Nation. In appreciation of this leadership, and in honor of Congressman Hyde's lifetime commitment to serving his country, I have requested that a tree be planted in Israel dedicated to his memory. 
   I again express my deepest sympathy to Congressman Hyde's family, friends, and the people of Illinois.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much to our colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida, Congresswoman BROWN. And I am so pleased to join my 30-Something colleagues here this afternoon, our newest 30-Something colleague from Connecticut CHRIS MURPHY. With our new-found responsibility, I have been a little tied up the last couple times we have had this Special Order hour, so I am really pleased to be able to be with you. And we have some fresh blood and some new dynamics that we will engage in. It will be really fun to work with you and banter a little bit. 
   But I will tell you that this being the day after the President's State of the Union Address, Mr. Murphy, I was particularly disturbed listening to the President. The privilege that we have here in this House, and it was yours for the first time last night, and I remember 2 years ago, I am just 2 years ahead of you in this process, and I remember the feeling that I had sitting in this Chamber and the awesome responsibility that I felt on my shoulders being this far from the President and having the chance to listen to him deliver that address, and the expectation that I had as a representative of my constituents, that the expectation that he would say something more than words. 
   And last year, if you recall, you were in your State legislature when he delivered last year's State of the Union. He talked about the need to end America's addiction to foreign oil, and subsequently that turned out to just be words because he ended up proposing in his budget, and they actually enacted, a cut in the energy legislation, that this Republican leadership that is no longer in charge here, they actually cut the funding to alternative energy, exploring alternative energy resources. 
   Now, last night he says the same thing in a different way. And we are just to the point, why should we expect that there is meaning and action coming down the pipe behind the words? 
   On the war in Iraq, I know I have heard from my constituents, and it is just shocking that after the response from the voters on November 7, that this President would not get the message that the American people were sending him. They want a new direction. They want to move the troops from a combat focus to a 
   training focus, get the Iraqi troops to stand up on their own so that that country can take care of itself. So it is just shocking the lack of understanding of his priorities and where he is on the issues that are most important to people. 
   On health care, the health care priorities. There are 47 million people in this country, 3 1/2 million in Florida, that don't have health insurance. And his solution to that problem is a tax deduction, a tiny tax deduction that he thinks will spur people who benefit from it to take that money and buy health insurance. That just shows a callous indifference. And you are an expert in health care; that was your focus. That shows a callous indifference to what the problems that the uninsured and underinsured are really facing. 
   You are probably familiar with the death spiral created by insurance companies where they cordoned off the people who are the most sick. Some States have adopted guaranteed-issue policies and modified community rating like we did in Florida so that there were only a few things that were taken into consideration when rates were set. But for the most part that is not what people are able to get when buying health insurance. So the sickest of the sick get cordoned off into a group; that group is priced out of the market, and then they don't have the ability to afford that health insurance. 
   A simple tax deduction is not going to make health insurance accessible and affordable for that group of people. It is just unbelievable, Mr. Murphy. And I fail to understand why this President only seems to keep his own counsel. It is just really unbelievable. 
   So I will yield to you or to Mr. Meek, but that was my feeling and my reaction in listening last night. And when I talked to our radio stations in south Florida this morning, I know the feedback that our radio hosts were getting was similar.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Will the gentleman yield for 1 second on that point? Because on the health care issue specifically, the gentlewoman from Florida talked about being supportive of universal health care. And, I mean, I am supportive of expanding access to health care to everyone as well. But our good friends on the other side  of the aisle like to use that as a bogeyman for us and imply that that means socialized medicine, and that we want to implement this single-payer system that is going to be government top-down health care. 
   There are ways to expand access to health care to large populations, to almost everybody who is uninsured, and then we only have to work hard towards ensuring that last phase of the population. We can expand access to health care for all children by expanding the SCHIP program. We can expand access to health care to more older Americans by simply expanding the Medicare program and letting people from 50 to 64 years old buy into that program. Those are bills that were filed when we were in the minority and that will be filed again and that we will have an opportunity to able to pursue now that we are past the 100-hour agenda. So just you having come just out of the State legislature and being a health care expert, I would just love to hear your thoughts about that.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, the President continues to ask this Congress and the American people to ``stay the course'' in Iraq. Well, Mr. President, today the American people and the Congress have said ``no more.'' 
   Today I add my voice once again to the growing number of retired military generals, the Iraq Study Group, and untold thousands of rank and file on the front lines who were calling for a new direction in Iraq. The success of our military depends on a sound strategy. Yet instead of fighting the terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan, our armed forces are overextended after 4 years of refereeing a civil war in the sands of Iraq. 
   The President's escalation of this war, his so-called surge, is not working. That much is clear. Since the escalation of this war 6 months ago, more than 25,000 troops have been sent to Iraq, 600 more U.S. soldiers have died, and more than 3,000 troops have been wounded. Countless thousands of Iraqis are dead, and today the violence in Iraq is at an all-time high. Those are facts that no one can deny. 
   Our troops have performed heroically in Iraq, but the Iraqi Government has failed to meet any, any of the benchmarks endorsed by the President in January. Political reconciliation within Iraq is nonexistent. A change of course is long overdue. 
   The time has come for the United States to responsibly redeploy our troops from Iraq and to refocus our efforts on protecting Americans from terrorism. The time has come for Iraqis to take primary responsibility for their country and for their security. 
   Let me be clear on one additional point. Democrats support the troops. 
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I personally have consistently voted to fund our troops and to provide our soldiers in the line of fire with the resources that they need. I do this because our brave servicemen and women are not risking their lives each and every day for one political party over another. They are risking their lives for America. 
   Our Nation owes our troops a strategy that is worthy of their sacrifice. But ``stay the course'' is not that strategy. It is a slogan that continues to fail them. 
   No, Mr. Speaker, if we really want to support our troops, it is time to get them out of Iraq and redeploy them to other areas where they can fight the terrorists who have attacked and who continue to threaten our Nation. That's where the war on terror should be waged.

As you may know, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a disturbing statistic. One in four young women between the ages of 14 to 19 has a sexually transmitted disease, and it is likely that she does not even know it. This amounts to an estimated 3.2 million teen girls in America with at least one of four common STDs, including chlamydia and HPV. 
   The good news is that these diseases and infections are preventable. We have a responsibility to make sure that parents and teenagers have the resources they need to make smart choices for their health and well-being. This includes access to education and access to affordable preventive health care and screening. 
   As a Co-Chair of the Young Women's Task Force for the Women's Caucus, I call on my colleagues to take note of the CDC's startling statistic, and I congratulate Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones for introducing a resolution supporting National STD Awareness Month.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the University of Florida Gators for winning the Bowl Championship Series National Football title last night. 
   After a hard fought season, the Gators proved victorious last night with a dazzling 41-14 triumph over the Ohio State University Buckeyes. I want to extend special congratulations to Florida's head coach, Urban Meyer, who trained this football team to be the best in the country. All of the athletes are shining stars for the university and deserve our highest praise. 
   Last night, the University of Florida made history by winning national titles in both men's basketball and football in the same season. Florida's academic reputation is stellar, our sports teams are number one and our fans are like none other. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be a Florida Gator. Congratulations to the students, faculty, alumni, and friends of the University of Florida. 
   I have just one thing left to say, Mr. Speaker, and that is: Two bits, four bits, six bits a dollar. All for the Gators, stand up and holler. Go Gators!

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much. We are all Gators today. It is a Gator Nation. And we were just thrilled that the fighting Gator football team came to play yesterday, dominated Mr. Ryan's team, although Mr. Ryan went to Youngstown; so he is not technically a Buckeye, but I guess anyone who hails from the State of Ohio is a Buckeye. And we enjoyed showing the Buckeyes that we belonged in that game, and we are just very proud of our Florida Gators.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much to my good friend, Mr. Meek, and it is so wonderful to be with my good friends in the 30-Something Working Group. We spent so many nights here talking about the need for us to move this country in a new direction, a new direction for America. That is what, Mr. Speaker, you and others talked about during the campaign. We went out and talked about making sure that we could increase the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years; have the student loan interest rate; fully implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations; make sure that we repeal the energy industry subsidies that they don't need because they are the most profitable industry in the entire world so that we can truly fund alternative energy resources; eliminate the prohibition against negotiating for lower prescription drug prices; and putting the stem cell research bill on the President's desk once again; and making sure that we can finally establish some accountability with this administration on the war in Iraq.     
   At last we will have the opportunity to bring them in and ask them the tough questions that our good friends on the other side of the aisle refused to ask for years. 
   We had an opportunity as the 30-something Working Group to point out and contrast what we would do in the majority if we were given that opportunity versus what the Republican leadership was doing for the last 12 years. And the American people responded and gave us that opportunity. 
   Some people might have started at the top of this hour, kind of scratched their head and wondered why we were talking about the University of Florida national championship and the Gators victory, but there is some analogy, all kidding aside. 
   The Gators showed that they came to play last night when no one expected them to win, when for months people didn't give them any chance of coming out on top and winning the national championship. I think that our victory on November 7 is analogous to that because certainly at the beginning of my first term in Congress 2 years ago, no one gave the Democrats a chance. No one gave us a snowball's chance of reaching the point that we did on November 7 and being able to elect enough Members to truly move this country in a new direction. 
   In part because of the Members that joined us on the floor each night and our Democratic Caucus colleagues who were so committed to get the message out and talking to their constituents and really appealing to the issues that the American people cared about, as opposed to the special interests and the culture of corruption and the pall that was cast over this Capitol for so long, now we are finally being given that opportunity. It is incredibly important. 
   One of the most amazing things for me as a woman was that last Thursday we were able to watch history in the making when the gavel was passed to Speaker  Nancy Pelosi as the first woman Speaker in United States history. I had my twin 7-year-olds on the floor that day, and I know you had your children on the floor with you that day, Mr. Meek, but the opportunity for our kids to see, and especially for little girls in America, to see that really anything is possible in America, for that, for us to be able to witness that was just incredible. 
   And today for us to be able to witness Speaker Pelosi preside over H.R. 1, the passage of H.R. 1, which was the first bill that we adopted in the 100-hours agenda that fully implements the 9/11 Commission agenda. 
   The Republicans minimally implemented those recommendations, and that is why the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen gave them Ds and Fs, because they had not allocated funding on the basis of risk and vulnerabilities. They had not created and rehearsed State and local emergency response plans. They had not addressed the interoperability issues between intelligence agencies and first responders. There were at least 10 items. They have not protected privacy and civil liberties with an oversight function. They have not improved air passenger screening. They were not checking all the cargo. There was no funding or mechanism to check all of the cargo that came through our ports. 
   H.R. 1 that we adopted today implements that right now. It was a thrill to watch Speaker Pelosi preside over the passage of the first item in our 100-hours agenda.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Expanding access to higher education was one of the critical elements, is one of the critical elements of the 100-hours agenda because America is all about opportunity. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle talk about prosperity and how it is essential to make sure that Americans can continue to prosper, and we absolutely believe that. But there is no denying that prosperity isn't possible in this or any other country without an education. 
   If you are denied access to education because of the lack of affordability, because you can't pay for it or because your ability to repay a loan is prohibited because the interest rate is so high that you are paying for the rest of your natural life and it takes such a huge chunk of your income that eventually you have to decide not to pursue an education, then prosperity isn't possible. 
   As you have in this chart, and Mr. Meek is going to talk about minimum wage, we lag behind the world in terms of global education standards. You have thousands of students who will graduate with engineering degrees this year. And look at the difference in numbers: 600,000 engineering degrees in China; 350,000 engineering degrees in India; and 70,000 engineering degrees in the United States of America.     
   Now, if that isn't an example and evidence of where we need to focus our priorities and make sure that we expand access to higher education so that we can grow that number, then our ability to be competitive globally is severely, severely impacted, and individual's ability to prosper is severely impacted.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. If the gentleman will yield, one of the things I wanted to point out is it could ultimately, as we continue to do these 30-something hours, it could be easy to presume now that we are in the majority that we would come here and only talk about the Democrats' agenda and what we are planning to do, and we are going to spend quite a bit of time talking about that during these hours. 
   But I think it is important that our colleagues and others who might hear us talking tonight understand that the reason that our taking the majority in the Congress was so important, besides our being able to implement an agenda, is the accountability factor. 
   We are going to come here, now that we are in the majority and control the agenda here, it is absolutely our responsibility because we have the ability to do it to hold this administration accountable, to ask questions, to hold hearings, to bring them here and make sure that they answer questions about their policies that the American people showed us on November 7 they don't agree with. 
   It is going to be incredibly important in the time that we spend on this floor that we not only talk about our agenda, but what we are doing to make sure that we restore the Congress' role, constitutional role, where we hold the administration accountable and reestablish the system of checks and balances.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. I think the key word you touched on is balance. That is why I am thrilled, and I know the two of you are as well, to have the opportunity to restore balance and to restore the American people's confidence in their government again. 
   Because, Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan, that is one of the things that was a casualty of the last several years, with the headline every other day, every day sometimes, about a colleague of ours on the other side of the aisle being indicted, as Mr. Meek said, or arrested. We have former colleagues in jail. We have lobbyists that inappropriately tried to influence this process that are in jail. 
   This election, I think, was a reflection of the American people's desire for change and to move in a new direction. And one of the things that Speaker  Pelosi has talked about, and talked about so often in the campaign, is what her speakership and our majority will be about is making this the most bipartisan Congress in the United States history, with the inclusiveness and the participation that Members on both sides of the aisle will have an opportunity to have, and that that is incredibly important. 
   That extends beyond just the Members here, but extends to the voices of the people that we are serving. The net roots, for example. That is a community that has been so instrumental and so involved in getting the message out about what people in the country care about. I know that the three of us have interacted during our time on the floor here with folks involved in the net roots and they have given voice to so many people exponentially that would not have had the ability to get our message out. It is incredibly important. 
   Inclusiveness and balance and confidence in government is I think going to be the watch words that will be really the clarion call of our majority, so I really look forward to that opportunity. 
   I tell you, where we are at this stage of our careers and our lives, I have been in public office now for, gosh, I guess it is 16 years, which is kind of amazing. But it is actually 16 years, and I have spent 4 of those years in the majority in the State House. Mr. Meek, we served a couple years in the majority together in the State House, and that is the last time that I had an opportunity to actually advance an agenda. We definitely spent a lot of time honing our defensive skills, and I think we have gotten pretty good at that and comparing and contrasting. But at the end of the day, most of us, the vast majority of us ran for office in order to make the world better, and now we have that opportunity. 
   Like you said, Mr. Ryan, we might not always do it right, but it won't be for lack of good intentions and it won't be for lack of trying to stand up for those who have no voice, which I think will be quite a marked contrast compared to, and I hate to directly question the intentions, but compared to the intentions of some over the last few years. That is the most diplomatic way I can put it.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much. It is a pleasure to join my 30-something colleagues, Mr. Meek and Mr. Murphy. 
   Mr. Meek, you started talking about the travesty that was revealed by The Washington Post just before last weekend about what is going on at Walter Reed Medical Center and the campus and its facilities. 
   I had the privilege of going to visit our men and women that are at Walter Reed who have come back from Iraq injured. Almost every soldier I met with was an amputee and went through a devastating experience, devastating injury. But the ward that they take you through, like this article says, is spit-polished and brand-spanking clean. There is not a shadow of what is described in this third-party validator, which is how we refer to our information that we bring out here to demonstrate the facts. 
   I want to read just a paragraph from the article. I want to highlight some of the things, and we have been joined by our good friend Mr. Altmire from Pennsylvania. 
   This article hit me like a ton of bricks: ``Life beyond the hospital bed,'' and this is what is going on at Walter Reed that is not what they show us as Members of Congress and that they show the President and Vice President about what is going on at Walter Reed. ``Life beyond the hospital bed is a frustrating mountain of paperwork. The typical soldier is required to file 22 documents with eight different commands, most of them off post, to enter and exit the medical processing world, according to government investigators. Sixteen different information systems are used to process the forms, but few of them can communicate with one another. The Army's three personnel databases cannot read each other's files and can't interact with the separate pay system or the medical record keeping databases. The disappearance of necessary forms and records is the most common reason soldiers languish at Walter Reed longer than they should,'' and it goes on. 
   That is just unbelievable. A mountain of red tape and bureaucracy is what our troops come back to the United States to and have to deal with. I thought we well established after 9/11 that interoperability and communication between systems was an obstacle that was intolerable. 
   How could we allow this to happen and just let our veterans, who fought for us so valiantly, and the analogy I will make is while our troops might not come home, and thank good they are not coming home to the same reaction as our Vietnam veterans came home to, how is this not as bad? It is actually worse, in a way, because instead of just having to suffer the wrath of their fellow Americans, which was a travesty and certainly hurtful and harmful, instead they come home and suffer the wrath of their government, the benign wrath of their government. ``Benign'' meaning not specifically intended to harm, but it is like death by a thousand cuts.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. That is a very important and valid point. 
   I want to read a quote, and that quote is this: ``So let's get something straight right now. To point out that our military has been overextended, taken for granted and neglected, that is no criticism of the military, that is a criticism of the President and Vice President and their record of neglect.'' 
   Who do you think said that? I will tell you who said that, George W. Bush, as a candidate, said that on November 3, 2000, in an interview on CNN. 
   I think it is pretty clear that he was right almost 7 years ago, and it is just sad that he didn't mean it. It is sad that he didn't actually do anything more than say those words instead of taking to heart what he supposedly believed at the time and making sure that it didn't happen when he became President. 
   Clearly Walter Reed, the lack of body armor and preparation and training that we are sending, that we have been sending and he was willing to send our troops over to Iraq and Afghanistan without, is clearly still something that he is willing to do. Unfortunately, all the President has been is a candidate who spews words with really not too much meaning behind them. It looks like Mr. Altmire would like to say something.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. On that point, just to focus on the National Guard and how correct you are about how they are being treated versus what they signed up for, there are now 14,000 National Guard troops being deployed earlier than they were originally scheduled to meet the demands of the President's proposed plans to escalate the war. 
   National Guard and Army units are being called up sooner than previously scheduled, and that is even though some of these units do not have the equipment that they need. They do not have the training, and some of them are having to go over there foregoing the training. 
   Mr. Meek and I are going to be meeting with our general, who is in charge of our National Guard in Florida very soon. I just saw the request today, and I am looking forward to meeting with him. I met with him in my district in Florida as well last year, and the conversations that I have had with him and with others about the condition of the equipment, not just the condition of the equipment that is going over  there, but what happens to the equipment once it comes back because we are not replacing the equipment and sending them new equipment after it has been through 5, 6 years of an Iraq War. 
   So the equipment that they are working on and that they are utilizing has been through war literally. I mean, we are not making sure that they have the equipment that they need. We are sending them over there two, three and four times now. 
   When I went to Walter Reed a couple of weeks ago, every single guy I met had been through three tours, three. One of the guys I met, his little boy was there, and literally his dad had been on three tours. His little boy was six, which means that this dad missed half of his child's life already, half. I mean, that is just inexcusable. That is not what our volunteers sign up for. I mean, even if you signed up for the regular standing Army, it is unreasonable to expect that they would have to have that kind of pressure, physical, mental, emotional pressure put on them as well as their families, especially in the middle of the situation in a war that we are involved in under dubious circumstances to begin with. 
   I do not know if Mr. Meek wants to jump in here now, but he is still sitting so I imagine not. So I will go back to Mr. Murphy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I want to follow up on what you are saying and emphasize and demonstrate what we are doing to our best, and I do mean doing to our best and brightest once they have come back. You have been an eloquent champion of our veterans. 
   I think it is important to recall a private conversation that you and I had on the floor during the run-up to the adoption of the supplemental. It happens that I am a member of the whip team, and you were my assignment that day. I had an opportunity to talk to you about whether we could count on your support for the supplemental and how important it was. 
   Your answer, which was the appropriate answer, was, well, Debbie, the answer is no, unless you can assure me that there was an increase for veterans health care. Because at that moment, I could not assure you because I did not have the information at my fingertips, I had to get back to you and was proud to be able to report that we did provide a significant increase that we were able to bump up beyond the continuing resolution significantly the health care we are providing to our veterans. But it is to your constituents' credit and the veterans that you represent that you do that. 
   But let us just go through some facts that we know. The percentage of Army servicemembers receiving medical retirement and permanent disability benefits back in 2001 was 10 percent. The percentage of the same Army servicemembers receiving medical retirement and permanent disability benefits in 2005 down to 3 percent. Army Reservists receiving medical retirement and permanent disability in 2001, 16 percent; same group in 2005, 5 percent. 
   Let us go to the case backlog at the Veterans Administration on new benefit claims in fiscal year 2006. 400,000-case backup. This is from the Army Times, third party validator. Average length of time veterans wait before receiving monthly benefits, 6 months to 2 years. That was in the Los Angeles Times. 
   The number of soldiers at Walter Reed navigating the medical and physical evaluation process since 2001 has doubled. The average length of time it takes for Army soldiers to convalesce and go through the military medical and physical evaluations, nine to 15 1/2 months.     
   The increase in the Army's physical disability caseload since 2001, 80 percent. The number of veterans from the global war on terror expected to enter the military and veterans health care systems in the coming years, 700,000. And I will just read the quote again from Candidate Bush: ``So let's get something straight right now. To point out that our military has been overextended, taken for granted, and neglected, that's no criticism of the military; that is the criticism of a President and a Vice President and their record of neglect.'' 
   Well, it sure is. And these statistics from the time that this President has been in the office are evidence of that. 
   I would be happy to yield to one of the three gentlemen here.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. Just to quickly help close us out,  the bottom line is that our veterans come home and face devastating treatment from their government. We have outlined that tonight. We send them over there with equipment that in many cases is faulty. We are not adequately preparing them and giving them enough time to be well trained to do their best over there. And they are doing their level best given the assignment that we give them. We are not providing them with the resources, and we are not providing them with the equipment. And, fortunately, we have a Democratic Congress now that is not going to give this President a blank check any longer, not going to let him run roughshod over our duty to be a check and balance on the administration. And that is what the 30-something Working Group is designed to outline. We are going to make sure that we get the message out and that we help our colleagues and anyone who might also hear this conversation between us understand what is really going on.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, in August I urged my colleagues to vote against an unconstitutional Senate bill. Simply put, that bill trampled on our constituents' constitutional right to privacy. 
   Today, I am proud to rise in support of the RESTORE Act, a bill that provides the intelligence community the tools it needs, but that restores the constitutional rights of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can be both safe and free, and this bill strikes the right balance. 
   This bill permits surveillance of foreign-to-foreign communication. It allows us to listen in on Osama bin Laden or any other terrorist who threatens our troops or country. This bill will keep us safe. 
   But this bill also requires a warrant from the FISA Court in order to eavesdrop on the communications of ordinary Americans, and it requires a court review of targeting procedures to ensure Americans' rights are protected. This bill restores our civil liberties. 
   Mr. Speaker, our colleagues across the aisle would rather play politics with this bill and unleash arguments of mass distortion, so let me be clear: nothing in this bill gives our constitutional rights to terrorists. 
   Our Republican colleagues create this smoke screen in order to hide the fact that they have taken away those same constitutional freedoms from Americans. 
   We need not choose between our secure and liberty. With the RESTORE Act, we can have both.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007. 
   Over the past few years, most Americans have witnessed devastating images of natural catastrophes strike our fellow citizens, from wildfires in California, tornadoes in the Midwest, to the hurricanes hitting the Gulf States in Florida, and wondered if they might be next. Even as the recovery begins after these disasters, for many, a new nightmare of rising insurance rates and dropped policy coverage begins. However, thanks to the sponsor of the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007, Congressmen Ron Klein and Tim Mahoney, many homeowners across America will be spared a similar nightmare. This bipartisan bill, and it is good to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle from Florida here as well, this bipartisan bill provides a critical tool that will help provide a fair and equitable solution to this crisis. 
   I cannot think of an issue that is more important to the economic survival of the homeowners of my State of Florida than dealing with the homeowners insurance crisis. Thank you, Congressmen Klein and Mahoney, and thank you to Chairman Barney Frank for bringing this bill to the floor today. It has been a long time in coming. 
   I urge Members to support it.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, so much, Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Altmire.  
   Let me tell you something else that we are laying down our marker on. We are not going away. The obstructionist Republicans might think that they have our number and that they have been able to block the efforts of this Democratic majority in trying to move this country in a new direction, but they will be sadly mistaken as we gradually turn this ship of State around. It takes a long time to turn a cruise ship around, something that is the size of this government, and it takes a long time to undo the horrendous damage that was done to this country during the 12 years of Republican majority in this Congress. 
   We slowly have been peeling the film of the culture of corruption that hung over this Capitol before we took the majority back.     
   We have feverishly worked to move this country in a new direction to expand access to health care, to make sure that we put our domestic priorities on the front burner. Now, we might have done that within the President's number, and that's essentially not what we wanted to do. What we wanted to do is make sure we weren't spending 10 times more in Iraq to continue this war than we were to increase the funding for health care and for education and for veterans health care funding. That's why, within the President's overall budget number, we reordered our priorities. We made sure that instead of cutting NIH funding grants and cutting health care, that we increased funding for the NIH grants. We made sure that we provide access to health care instead of cutting it by $595 million, that we increased it so that we could expand access to health care to more people. We made sure that instead of cutting veterans health care benefits we passed still the largest single increase in the history of the VA, a $3.7 billion increase. 
   We have a Democratic stamp on this budget. We passed a budget that has our priorities, the American people's priorities, and refocuses attention on the domestic needs that we have in this country, and we will be back after this recess and make sure that we are going to focus on the needs of the American people. 
   I'll be happy to yield to my friend

   And do you know what our good friends on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Altmire, have been trying to preserve? They've been trying to preserve subsidies for the big oil industry. That's the thing that we were not able to get done because the Republicans in the Senate and here blocked making sure that we could repeal $13 billion in subsidies for Big Oil, the most profitable industry in America.

So in the time that I have been involved in public service, which is over 15 years now, the mantra of our good friends on the other side of the aisle has always been that they are the party of less government, and that they are the party of fiscal responsibility. And in recent history, and in long-term history, my understanding is that it's this President that built up more foreign debt than all 42 previous Presidents combined, and this President that took us from a $3 billion surplus to a $5 billion deficit, in his first term,

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Excuse me. Trillion. Forgive me. Trillion dollars. And so who, the question that I have for you is, so which party is the party of fiscal responsibility? Which party can be trusted to make sure that we have a vibrant economy, that we create jobs, that we don't operate in a deficit situation and that we have PAYGO rules that ensure that we don't spend more money than we take in? Which one would that be?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Okay. I wasn't quite certain because if you listen to the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, they talk a good game. But when it comes to action, backing up the words with action, just like when the President stood in that rostrum a couple of years ago and laid out the notion that we should end America's addiction to foreign oil, but then promptly pushed an energy bill through the then Republican Congress that gave away those $14 billion in subsidies to the oil industry that we're now trying to repeal. That was just unbelievable. And I can't use certain words that I think should be applicable to that situation because it violates the House rules, so I won't. But I think we all know what the definition of saying something and doing another actually is.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. In my wrap-up remarks, first of all, I want to thank each of you that are parts of the 30-Something Working Group, and Mr. Murphy, who headed home to his family this evening, for continuing to hang in here and coming out. We certainly could have disbanded the 30-Something Working Group, Mr. Ryan. We could have said, you know, our work here is done. We won the majority and now we can just, you know, go make good policy and go home. But it's clear that our work is far from done. We have a lot left to do on the agenda. We have to make sure that we deal with expanding access to health care, that we continue to push for the remaining provisions of the energy bill that we were not able to get included. We have to make sure that we focus on bringing our troops home. And people need to understand that we're not, we're going to be relentless in continuing to try to make sure we do that. 
   People should understand that the vote tonight did not pass with, the vote on the funding for the war in Iraq did not pass with a majority of Democratic votes. It passed with a majority of the Republican votes. This is this President's war and this is the Republicans' war, and it will continue to be their war. They are the ones that are leaving our troops twisting in the wind with their families being separated from them with repeated, over-the-top tours of duty, three and four times over there, having more than a year, less than a year between tours of duty. 
   We've got to make sure that we think about our troops and focus on the fact that it is clear now, even with the reduction in violence, Mr. Ryan, that the Iraqi leadership has made no progress. And they've made no progress because they don't need to because they know right now with the message that this President is sending that we're going to be there as long as they need us. There's no pressure, no incentive, and we need the American people to understand that we will continue to come out here; we will continue to talk about the priorities that they care about. And now that we're in the majority we're going to continue to press to adopt those priorities and shame the Republicans on the other side of the aisle every single day until we get dangerously close to this election and we put some fear in their hearts so that they don't continue to stick with this President who is completely wrong on the priorities that the American people care about.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I mean, what we have tried to do in the 30 Something Working Group is to highlight, particularly when it comes to the domestic agenda of this caucus, what the other side, our good friends on the other side of the aisle's, decisions and the ramifications of those decisions and the impact that they will have. 
   And we had 45 Republicans do the right thing on this SCHIP vote on this children's health insurance bill, and what we need them to do is cast the right decision again, vote to override the President's veto, and we need about 17 Republicans to come with us to realize that they made the wrong decision in voting against it so that we can make sure that we give access to children, not those who are already covered by private health insurance. 
   The President has tried to spread the misperception that this program and this expansion is about taking kids off of private health insurance and putting them on government health insurance. That is totally false. 
   What is actually happening is we are going to expand access to health insurance for children that don't currently have it, for children whose families fall in the gap between Medicaid and private health care. That's what the children's health insurance program has  been all about, and we need to make sure that the members of this institution, of the United States House of Representatives, be the representative body that they were elected to be and do the right thing by our kids.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (PROTECT OUR CHILDREN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support Senate bill 1738, the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't have to tell you that children today are growing up in a completely different world than we did. Our children have wonderful opportunities to learn in ways that we never had, but there are also dangers our generation never had to consider. 
   The Internet has facilitated an exploding multibillion dollar market for child pornography. Tragically, the demand for this criminal market can only be supplied by graphic new images, and these images can only be supplied through the sexual assault of more children. 
   This bill, like its House companion, H.R. 3845, that passed the House overwhelmingly last November, addresses an issue that is central to the goals and vision of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and the New Direction Congress, protecting our children. 
   The Internet is a truly wonderful tool. It has opened up the world for our children, but it has also opened up our children to the world. 
   A year ago, in June, I visited with a very special group of parents called the Surviving Parents Coalition, and I was not prepared for what they had to tell me. They shared with me their own horrific stories of how their children were abducted by sexual predators. As we all know, some of these children will never come home. 
   As the mother of three young children myself, their stories broke my heart. And as a Member of Congress, I felt compelled to act. What surprised me most about these brave parents was their message; they told me that if we wanted to prevent predators from hurting other children like theirs, that the way to do it is to go back through the Internet and get them. 
   A 2005 Justice Department study found that 80 percent of child pornography possessors have images and videos of children being sexually penetrated, another 21 percent possess images of bondage, sadistic abuse, and torture. 
   The children depicted in these photos are very young. There are even Web sites that provide live pay-per-view rates of very young children. These images are crime scene photos created by a thriving industry that uses children as sexual commodities. 
   Special Agent Flint Waters of the Wyoming State Police, a highly respected child exploitation investigator, testified at a Judiciary Committee hearing last year that there are nearly 500,000 identified individuals in the United States trafficking child pornography on the Internet. That's half a  million people right here in the United States. And law enforcement knows who they are and they know where they are. But what shocked me the most and what compelled me to get involved in this issue is that, due to a lack of resources, law enforcement is investigating less than 2 percent of these known 500,000 individuals. And make no mistake, law enforcement knows where they are, they just don't have the resources to go get them. 
   Even more shocking is that it is estimated that if we were to investigate these cases, we could actually rescue a child victim nearly 30 percent of the time.     
   Think about that. That means there are thousands of children out there in America just waiting to be rescued. 
   Alicia Kozakiewicz, whose testimony at last October's judiciary hearing moved all of us, is a living, breathing reminder of the lives that we can save. Alicia told us how over a period of months she was groomed by a 40-year-old predator pretending to be a teenage girl. When Alicia, who was 13 years old at the time, agreed to meet her cyber-friend in real life, he kidnapped her from her suburban Pittsburgh driveway and held her captive in his Virginia dungeon where he performed unspeakable sexual acts upon her day after day and broadcast it over the Internet. Just when Alicia told us that she had given up all hope, she was rescued by FBI agents. 
   The FBI found her because the Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, or ICAC, had the technology to lift the digital fingerprints of this perpetrator's crimes and to discover the location where he had held her captive chained to the floor. 
   The PROTECT Our Children Act will help provide the safety net that we so desperately need by giving us the resources and the coordination we need to bring these predators to justice. It will create statutory authority for these highly successful ICAC Task Forces, which support State and local law enforcement agencies. It will supplement this new local effort with hundreds of new Federal agents who will be solely dedicated to crimes against children. It will also provide desperately needed forensic crime and computer labs so agents can uncover troves of electronic evidence, locate these perpetrators and bring them to justice. 
   At the October Judiciary Committee hearing, a representative from the FBI told us two things that boggled my mind: First, that the number of agents being exclusively assigned to these cases was actually shrinking, and second, that they are giving millions of dollars that Congress had appropriated to combat child pornography to programs that have nothing to do with child protection. 
   This bill will set us on a new course by creating a National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention. And although I preferred the special counsel provision in the House bill, I am proud to support this measure because this national strategy will ensure that the Federal Government's efforts in this era are no longer disjointed or haphazard. Instead, there will finally be a person in charge at the Department of Justice who will report to Congress and be responsible for real results. 
   I want to thank my House cosponsor, Ranking Member JOE BARTON, for his leadership, his concern, and his compassion for our children and their safety. And thank you, Senator Biden, for your capable staff and for your tireless work in the Senate. Your skilled negotiations helped us arrive at this moment. Thank you to NCMEC President Ernie Allen and my good friend and colleague from Houston, Congressman Nick Lampson, for your improvements to the bill with the SAFE Act. And honestly, thank you, Oprah Winfrey and all of your viewers for every letter, every telephone call, every fax and every e-mail. You helped break the Senate logjam and proved that Congress is responsive to the people. 
   Thank you, Erin Runnion, Ed Smart, Mary Kozakiewicz, names that are far too familiar to Americans because of the travesty that happened to their children, and to all the founding members of the Surviving Parents Coalition. When this bill got mired in petty partisan politics, they helped us remember what our effort was really about. It is about Samantha, it is about Elizabeth, and it is about Alicia. It is making sure we rescue every child we can and that we leave none behind. And thank you to Flint Waters for developing the software to locate predators and rescue children. Your work and the work of the ICAC Task Force agents across this country from Broward County, Florida to Wyoming, who wake up every morning, work long hours each day, only to go home at night knowing they don't have the resources or staffing power to rescue every child. The angst that must cause is unimaginable. 
   Last and certainly not least, I want to commend the inexhaustible determination of Grier Weeks, Camille Cooper, David Keith and all our friends with the National Association to PROTECT Children. They kept our noses to the grindstone and our eyes on the prize. And we would never be here without their effort. They have shown us what we can do when Congress comes together and puts partisan differences aside.

   Above all else, though, Stephanie was my friend, and one of my first friends here in Washington. Her room-filling energy, her passion, her dedication, her voice for the downtrodden, all of these will be missed by the people of Ohio. Her intelligence, her expertise, her counsel will be missed by all of us here in this Chamber.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I too rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of the independence of the State of Israel, and to reaffirm the steadfast friendship between our two strong democratic nations. 
   Sixty years ago today, on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel declared sovereignty and independence as a homeland for the Jewish people. With little resources and seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Israel has become a thriving and prosperous democracy, and has made worldwide contributions in technology, medicine, agriculture and environmental innovation. 
   When we speak about Israel, too often we focus on Israel's troubles and not on her beauty and her spirit. But what I want to focus on today is her resolve. Since independence, Israel has continually overcome every conceivable roadblock. She has beaten back hostile neighbors during war, and now endures terrible emotional and economic hardship from terrorist cowards who perpetrate hideous violence against innocent victims. 
   As a critical partner in the fight against terror, and as the only democracy in the region, Israel's strength and security is paramount. Therefore, I encourage this House to continue to pass bipartisan bills in support of Israel and her ability to protect herself from antagonistic neighbors. 
   The blossoming of a nation that grew from desert sand into a thriving example of democracy, economic progress and cultural diversity is a magnificent achievement for this strong and vibrant country. 
   I congratulate Israel on all she has achieved in just 60 years, and I look forward to a bright future for this extraordinary nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it doesn't really surprise me that our good friends on the other side of the aisle have yet another drilling solution to our energy problems. Because it seems that with every energy problem, they have never found an energy problem that drilling won't solve. When will our colleagues in the minority get it into their heads that we cannot drill our way out of our energy problems? 
   What I think is amazing is that they have actually finally realized that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Some of them have finally acknowledged that global warming is a problem. But they still refuse to let go of the tired direction that they continue to want to travel in, which is to prop up their wealthy corporate interests, prop up the oil industry, which is the most profitable industry in this country, with billions of dollars in oil subsidies. 
   And today's solution, in this motion to instruct, is that we should drill for more oil in a pristine environmental track in Alaska, go off the coast of Florida and the Outer Continental Shelf, drop some oil drills so that we can really severely negatively impact the tourism across the coastal regions instead of trying to make sure that we can truly invest in alternative energy research. Which part of ``No, we need an alternative'' don't they understand? 
   Well, consistently the voters have said they want to move this country in a new direction. They want to make sure that we invest in alternative energy research and wean ourselves truly off of our dependence on oil. Not just hear more talk about it. 
   Mr. Speaker, drilling is not the answer. It is inappropriate to suggest that we should have more drilling in ANWR, in Wyoming, off the coast of Florida. We need to make sure that we  can finally step up and make a bipartisan commitment that we will invest in alternative energy research so that we can finally end this energy crisis that we find ourselves in. 
   I'm glad to see that the Republicans finally acknowledge it's a problem.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much to my good friend from Ohio. What is more baffling is that it is bad enough that the President is, in this proposed budget, asking for more tax cuts for the wealthiest few, but what is more disheartening, deflating, insulting is that he is doing it on the backs of Medicaid recipients and Medicare beneficiaries. 
   There is a $252 billion Medicare cut, a net $28 billion Medicaid cut in this budget. Yet still there are billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy. I mean, how do you stand behind a podium at a press conference, how do you hold up this big, thick, hulking document and say that this is a representation of your values, of our country's values? 
   Tax cuts for the wealthy and slashing health care for those who need it most and who can least afford it. I just honestly wonder every single day who raised these people. What were they talking about around their dinner table? It was obviously a different conversation than what was discussed around my dinner table. 
   I come from not a poor background, not a wealthy background, but you know, I ate every night, we woke up and ate breakfast every day. Because I was comfortable in that regard and because my family was able to provide for us, we were taught around that dinner table that you took care of and gave back. In the Jewish religion, it is called Tikkun Olam. You give back to the community and help people who can least afford it, and this budget is the antithesis of that. This is give to the people who can best afford it and do it and take from the people who can afford it the least. 
   I guess that is another example of why Democrats were successful across this country. Why both of my colleagues were successful in defeating Republican incumbents because the message was clear and they wanted a new direction.

   Right now, I think the eligibility is twice that of the poverty level, and Secretary Leavitt just signed off on a formula that would narrow those children who could potentially be eligible for children's health insurance, I mean, at a time in our country when people are struggling to afford health care, when we have more and more people, especially children join the ranks of the uninsured, which means when you are sick, they cannot afford to go to the doctor and they use our emergency rooms as primary health care.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Just actually if you are momentarily at a loss, I have the privilege of sitting on the House Appropriations Committee, as does Mr. Ryan, and we will have a  chance to take this document apart pretty carefully, one of the things that I was reviewing as we received this today was just the continuous example that this administration provides in representing a policy in one way and doing something completely different. 
   I mean, we have to be careful about the words we choose when we are on the House floor referring to the President, but I will point you to the section of the proposed budget that talks about how we finally are including at least some portion of the war budget inside the budget, instead of doing it all as emergency supplemental funding. So we have to give the President credit for at least including a portion of that in the budget. 
   However, he actually does not have any funding for the war, assumes no funding for the war past the end of 2008. There is no funding in his proposed budget for 2009. I think probably everyone in this country would like nothing more than for us to be completely finished in this war in Iraq by that point, but that is not the track that we are on and it is not the track that the President has suggested that we are going to be on. 
   So, there is a certain lack of clarity in terms of the distinction between what his budget represents and his rhetoric. They are not matching each other, and I think people see through that. We are fortunately now running this institution. So, through our accountability process, we can show the disparity between what the budget represents and what the actual policy implementation is.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. That brings me back to my, you know, sort of private thoughts, when reviewing the budget proposal, and the changes in the SCHIP program formula, where are their values, where are their priorities? If you lay out the choices they had, they choose covering the formula and covering fewer kids. 
   Perhaps it is that President Bush's daughters are grown now, or that they have always had health care coverage or that he grew up in a family that maybe didn't understand need. But there is something desperately wrong with the priorities and the values of this administration in terms of the direction they are moving in this country. 
   That is why, at least fortunately now, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Altmire, Mr. Murphy, we have some balance. We have the ability to exert Congress' role as a check and balance. We have the 30-something Working Group that can come to the floor each night and talk about those issues, talk about what is important to the American people, and the way we want to continue to move this country in the new direction that our constituents have asked for.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. It is wonderful to be here with my good and long-time friend, Mr. Meek of Florida, and our relatively new friend, Mr. Altmire from Pennsylvania. I have to tell you, Mr. Altmire, it has been such a pleasure to have the 41 new freshmen Members of our Democratic Caucus join us in being able to move this country in a new direction. It has really injected a vibrancy, a new vibrancy, an energized vibrancy, into our caucus. You guys are fresh from the campaign trail, as Speaker Pelosi always talks about. You came with stories from the grass roots and talking about things that people in America care about. 
   Oftentimes what happens in this institution here, we get a little stale and crusty. When we are all making, many of us, policy thousands of miles away from our constituents. Myself and Mr. Meek, we are a thousand miles from our constituents. You are a good 2 or 3-hour drive from yours. Mr. Murphy is a little further than that. It becomes easy to be desensitized to what the real needs and concerns are. We get wrapped up in how important Congress supposedly is, and that is when it gets dangerous. 
   That is what happened to our friends on the other side of the aisle when they were in charge over the last 2 years. They were engulfed by a culture of corruption. They really engaged in the priorities of K Street and the priorities of the wealthiest people in America instead of the priorities of the average working family, and that is what SCHIP is all about. That is what the Children's Health Insurance Program is all about. It is about getting basic health care, not to people who make a lot of money, not to people who have private health insurance as the President has said who would supposedly drop it if they were suddenly eligible for SCHIP, but for people who are the working poor, the people who fall in the huge gap that exists between not qualifying for Medicaid and not being able to afford to buy either the insurance that your employer provides you or buying it on your own. 
   So what that means is that if you don't have a children's health insurance program that your child is eligible for and that your child has access to, then you are using the emergency room as your primary means of health care. So I am so glad we had the infusion of energy from your class, Mr. Altmire and Mr. Murphy, so we could make sure we could pass bipartisan legislation like the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Mr. Meek referred to the President's comments about how Congress needs to get to work. Again, it is funny. It is humorous. It is actually sad. I joined Congress in the 109th Congress, the term before Mr. Murphy and Mr. Altmire, and a couple of terms after Mr. Meek. We were in session in the 109th Congress a total of 89 days.     
   Now how many days are there in a year?

So, you know, if you discount those, I can't really calculate the math that quickly, but just a couple hundred, right, couple hundred days, and we were in session for 89. It was a record low for the history of the Congresses. We were known as the do nothingest of do nothing Congresses. 
   So I think the President needs to take a look at history, maybe open a history book, maybe open a book, and take a look at what actually goes on here in the 110th since Democrats took control versus what was going on for the last 12 years. 
   We're about making sure that we get the America people's priorities in focus: children's health insurance; making sure that we can focus on alternative energy sources; making sure we can expand health care for more individuals; truly end America's addiction to foreign oil; recognize that global warming is a problem and not just say that it is and do nothing. We want to make sure that the future is really bright for the American people.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Murphy, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Altmire, Mr. Meek, we in the 30-Something Working Group generally try to make sure that the people that are able to listen to us, our colleagues, the Speaker, and anyone else within the sound of our voice, when we do these round robin conversations on the House floor we ask people not to take our word for it. We ask people to look at the third-party validators that we present on the floor and judge for themselves. We are presenting the facts here, not just making stuff up and talking in flowery sound bites. 
   Let's look at today's editorial in USA Today. What they said today about the President's veto and what action Congress should take tomorrow is our view on the children's health program. Bush Gives Bogus Answers to the $83,000 Question. That is the headline on the editorial. In summary, the main quote which summarizes the body of their editorial is that, ``Bush's claim is misleading at best, simply wrong at worst. The House would do well to look past the President's deceptive rhetoric and override his veto.'' That is USA Today's editorial from today. 
   We are going to cast this vote tomorrow, my friends, and people have a choice. When they swore to uphold the Constitution, at the same time we know that they made a commitment to their constituents to stand up for them; and that when you represent your constituents in government, you are supposed to do that and be there for people who don't have a voice. That is what this vote is about. It is who is for kids, and who stands with the President. It is very stark, very black and white.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. The only thing I want to jump in on, Mr. Altmire, is that the bottom line is that the track record of this administration is that generally the facts are not on the side of their argument, so they have to make it up. I mean, that has been their M.O. the entire, we are on 7 years now, their entire administration. When the facts aren't on your side, make it up. And just like Mr. Meek has said repeatedly on this floor during our working group sessions, make it up and repeat it over and over and over again, and hopefully people will believe it is true. Only the people are on to them now.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. That's okay because we are all pretty worked up about this. This is really important when it comes down to making sure. I have kids too. And Mr. Altmire has kids. One day Mr. Murphy and Mr. Ryan are going to have kids. It really matters to all of us. 
   But one of the important points that we have not made is how effective this program is. The SCHIP program, the Children's Health Insurance Program provides health care to kids who need it and who wouldn't have it if there wasn't an SCHIP program, and there won't be an SCHIP program if we don't make sure we override the President's veto or pass a bill and make sure we keep putting it on his desk until he signs it. 
   I think it's interesting, the President likes to call himself The Decider. So it's time for him to decide which of the families he thinks shouldn't get coverage, don't deserve health insurance. 
   How about this family? The Wilkerson family in St. Petersburg, Florida. This is personal, this is the Mom speaking. This is personal not only to us, but for millions of parents across the United States, said Bethany's mother, Dara, in a telephone call Monday with reporters about why she and her husband, Bo, are allowing such a focus on their daughter. Dara Wilkerson said Bethany had to have heart surgery in 2005 when she was 6 months old after doctors told them she had been born with two holes in her heart and a valve that didn't close as it should. 
   The Wilkersons said their annual household income is about $34,000 from their jobs, and they cannot afford private insurance. But even if they could, Bethany's pre-existing condition, the heart problem she was born with, made enrollment in a private plan impossible, her mother said. Thanks to Florida's version of SCHIP, the State KidCare program, she said Bethany gets the care she needs to recover from her lifesaving surgery. 
   Those are the kinds of kids that get coverage that wouldn't get it if not for the SCHIP program. Those are the kinds of kids that our colleagues who choose not to vote to override the President's veto tomorrow are going to deny. 
   And that's the last thing I wanted to say as we wrap up since we've got five of us here tonight, and I don't know who to throw it to.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, with the death of Congressman TOM LANTOS, the world lost an inspiring leader who dedicated his life to religious freedom and human rights. 
   Now, it has been noted that TOM was the only Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress, and I think it's important to note that with the sun setting on this generation of Americans, he will very likely remain the only Holocaust survivor to have served here. 
   His leadership and guidance served as the moral conscience of America's commitment to protecting human rights. He lived the concept of ``never again,'' and he stood against persecution all over the globe. 
   For me, I would like to get a little bit personal myself. As a newer Member of Congress, I can tell you that since I got here, TOM LANTOS always made me feel like my grandfather was looking out for me. He always had a word of encouragement, always made me feel good about myself. If I felt a little shaky, I could turn to TOM, and he would tell me, ``Honey, it's okay. Go out and just do your best. You are going to do great.'' He would always offer those words of encouragement. So that was really an incredible feeling to have that kind of support. 
   As a young Jewish American, I can tell you that we all believed that Representative LANTOS served as a role model for what we want public service to be. His dedication to lifting up oppressed people throughout the world  serves as our personal inspiration. And I know that his service was a tremendous source of pride for the Jewish community across this country and for his constituents. 
   I, and countless others, feel a deep sense of loss in his passing, but we take solace in the knowledge that the world is a better place because of this great individual.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the second annual Jewish American Heritage Month, which takes place in communities across the country each May. 
   Jewish American Heritage Month promotes awareness of the contributions American Jews have made to the fabric of American life, from technology and literature to entertainment, politics and medicine. 
   As we are all well aware, the foundation of our country is built upon the strengths of our unique cultures and backgrounds. While our diversity is our strength, ignorance about many cultures is still prevalent. 
   Because Jews make up only 2 percent of our Nation's population, most Americans have had few interactions with Jews and Jewish culture. The limited understanding of Jewish traditions and the Jewish experience and the historical role Jews have played in our Nation's development contributes to stereotypes and prejudices about Jews and the Jewish community. 
   For example, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, most recent hate crime statistics report that 69 percent of criminal incidents motivated by religious bias stemmed from anti-Jewish prejudice. 
   Like Black History Month and Women's History Month, Jewish American Heritage Month recognizes the abundance of contributions American Jews have made to the United States over the last 353 years. 
   It is my hope that by providing the framework for the discussion of Jewish contributions to our Nation, we will be able to reduce the ignorance that ultimately leads to anti-Semitism. One way Jewish American Heritage Month counters these prejudices is by providing educators the opportunity to include American Jews in discussions of history, as well as highlighting the leadership of members of the Jewish community in significant historical events. 
   For example, it might surprise many to learn that it was an American Jew, Irving Berlin, who wrote the lyrics to the song God Bless America. Even the very foundations of our country were impacted by Jews. Haym Salomon, a Jewish man, was one of the largest financiers of the American Revolutionary War. 
   And Rabbi Joachim Prinz was a passionate civil rights activist, appearing on the podium just moments before Dr. Martin Luther King delivered his ``I Have a Dream'' speech. And the list goes on, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is why communities across the country have come together to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month. Two years ago the Jewish Community in south Florida approached me with the idea to honor the contributions of American Jews with a designated month each year. As the concept gained momentum, 250 of my colleagues joined me as original cosponsors of a resolution urging the President to issue a proclamation for this month. Senator Arlen Specter led the effort in the Senate, and together the House and Senate unanimously passed the resolution supporting the creation of Jewish American Heritage Month. President Bush proclaimed the month of May as Jewish American Heritage Month for the first time in 2006, and again issued a proclamation this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to announce that a coalition of organizations has come together to develop curriculum and coordinate events. This coalition, called the Jewish American Heritage Month Coalition, is led by United Jewish Communities, the American Jewish Historical Society, the American Jewish Archives and the Jewish Women's Archives. 
   The events can all be found on the national calendar of the Jewish American Heritage Month Coalition's Web site at www.JewishHeritage.us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to pause for a moment and thank this coalition for their tireless efforts to promote the outstanding events across the country. Each day in May has been packed with programs celebrating the contributions of American Jewry to our country, with movies, plays, art exhibitions, speakers, musical performances, and innovative educational curricula. 
   The Jewish American Heritage Month Coalition and the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington kicked off the month with a reception attended by several Members of Congress and about 200 guests. 
   Right here in Washington, the Library of Congress and the National Archives and Records Administration have hosted films, lectures, and discussions about Jewish contributions to America. 
   In my home State of Florida, there was a celebration of Jewish music and a discussion of Jewish contributions to the civil rights movement.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. 
   And I am going to maybe abbreviate my view on what happened last week and just call it what it is: hypocrisy. 
   Where were our good friend on the other side of the aisle when they controlled this process for 12 years? And I am not going to spend a lot of time on the process because that is all they have because if they allow the debate to turn to the substance of the legislation, the substance of the appropriations bills that we are moving forward and will pass off this floor, with the vast majority of them supporting it because they have to, because when they admit that the substance of the legislation that we are putting forward in the Homeland Security bill, in the military construction bill, in the other bills that will be coming forward to this floor, they have to admit that not only are they good bills but they go much further and do a much better job of providing for the needs of this country than they ever did. 
   On the floor last week, I took an opportunity to spend a few minutes debating the process with them. One of the things that I had an opportunity to engage in debate on was where was their outrage on the other side when they controlled this process? Where were the reformers, leaping to their feet, urging and pounding on their leadership to adopt transparency and to adopt a process in which they could have the maximum amount of input into earmark reform? 
   The answer is it was nonexistent because they didn't care about it. It didn't matter to them. They were very happy fat and happy to take all the earmarks they could get, bring them home, tied up with their lobbyists and their friends and their culture of corruption, all twisted up and intertwined, and that is what their process was like. And our process is clear and transparent and participatory and inclusive, and they can't stand it. So what they have to do is they have to try to muck up the perception of what we are doing here because if they acknowledge what is really going on, not only have we adopted a more inclusive, more transparent process when it comes to earmark reform, but the substance of our legislation they have to support because they know that we are going much further than they did. 
   I want to go beyond process, though, to President Bush's veto threat of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. He actually has threatened to veto this bill, which is just absolutely astonishing. And one of the things that I  have heard him articulate, Mr. Meek and Mr. Altmire, is that if the Congress proposes to spend $1 over what he proposed in his administration's budget that he would veto any of that legislation. And that includes the Homeland Security bill, which provides for the homeland security needs for our border protection, for our first responders, for the 9/11 Commission recommendations that we passed in the first bill out of this Chamber during our 100-hour push for the Six in 06 agenda, and the President is actually proposing to veto a bill that would ensure that we spend more money on protecting our homeland domestically. 
   You know, you can argue process and earmarks and reform and all that. But at the end of the day, that is the stark contrast that people of this country have to choose from. When they go to the polls next November and when they evaluate how they think a Democratic Congress is doing versus how a Republican Congress did, at the end of the day, we are passing a Homeland Security appropriations bill that will really provide for the domestic homeland security needs, as opposed to continuing to twist us up and mire us in the war in Iraq with an endless, open-ended commitment that never proposes to get us out of there. 
   On top of that, we have a President who has been critical of a military construction bill that will provide for the largest single increase in veterans' health care in history. I mean this is how backwards their priorities are. Under the Republican control, their goal was to help lobbyists, was to make sure that they brought home as many earmarks that were pushed by lobbyists as they could. And, instead, what we are doing here is we have transparency, where people will know, anyone can know, who is sponsoring an earmark, where any Member can offer an amendment to strike an earmark, where any Member can offer to sponsor an earmark. Members will be able to participate in the conference process, which you would think that that would be a normal thing, but it wasn't normal under the Republicans because you couldn't even participate as the minority in the conference process.     
   But at the end of the day, all of that has been a deliberate distraction because they can't argue with the content of our appropriations bills because they are much stronger and go much further and do more for the country than they did. They don't win that debate. They don't win a head-to-head, toe-to-toe debate on the substance, so they have to try to distract people with the process. And that is what I am hopeful that we can get into in this 30-Something hour and future special order hours that we participate in, because what we need to make sure we focus on is the substance of our legislation, because they would like nothing better than to twist us up in debate on process. 
   Mr. Meek.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Let's zero in specifically on what we did compared to what they did. If you recall, that was the energy bill that they held open for 40 minutes longer than our normal time limit so they could twist enough arms to get the votes to ensure that they could give the oil companies $14 billion in subsidies, give them those subsidies in the face of world record profits. Now, you know, we support profit. Profit is a good thing. Profit is not a bad word; it's a good thing. But when you are doing what they did, which was forgive the royalties that the oil industry would have been required to pay the Federal Government; they are supposed to pay the Federal Government to use the land that they drill on in exchange for the oil that they pull out and make a profit on. And the Republican majority gave away the $14 billion and said, no, no, no, very profitable oil industry, that's okay, you don't have to pay us. Just put that in your pocket, no problem. And what we did, as part of our 100-hour agenda in the Six in '06 bills that we passed when we first became the majority is we passed a bill that repealed those $14 billion in give-aways and said, what we are going to do with that money is we are going to use it to fund alternative energy research so that we can make sure that we truly make a commitment to wean ourselves off of our addiction to foreign oil, which were nice words that the President said in the State of the Union last year, but then promptly he signed that energy bill that gave $14 billion in subsidies away to the oil industry. So I just wanted to jump off that poster because it really needed to be zeroed in on.

We are all pleased that we have been joined by Mr. Altmire and the 40 other Democratic freshmen in his class who are majority makers who came to Congress to help us move this country in a new direction and make it possible to move this country in a new direction. 
   The stark contrast you are talking about, where you have tired old, same old, do business as shall Republicans standing with the Republican standing with the President, supporting his veto, his suggestion that he would veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill. 
   Now, I sit on the Appropriation Committee so I know what is in that bill and had an opportunity to comment on it and participate in it, and I am proud to have supported it. 
   But I would like Mr. Altmire, given that he is part of the new direction Democrats and our freshmen class who brought us to this point, to outline for us, let's talk just exactly what the  President is talking about vetoing. Let's outline that for folks.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman outlining what the President has been threatening to veto. 
   I want to take it a step beyond the Homeland Security appropriations bill and outline a few of the other bills all related to homeland security that the President has also threatened to veto. Tonight what we aim to show, fact versus fiction, is basically who is for homeland security and who is just kidding, who is just talk, who is just a lot of hot air, versus who is supportive of putting forward substance. 
   The only thing I can think of in terms of a reason that you have these veto threats and suddenly the President discovers ink in his pen, never having threatened a veto in his first 6 years, instead of an ``R'' next to the idea there is a ``D'' next to the idea. Now this is from a person who has talked a really nice story about being bipartisan and working with the Democratic Congress. This is how he has been proposing to work with the Democratic Congress: proposing to veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill which has a lot of very important issues that went unaddressed by the Republican Congress. 
   Also, threatening to veto the 9/11 Commission recommendations which was his own 9/11 Commission. We just passed that bill in our Six in 06 agenda with a vote of 299-128. And that would fully implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   The Homeland Security authorization bill which is the statutory provisions in Homeland Security that go with the appropriations bill, he has threatened to veto that. That authorizes $40 billion for the activities of the Department of Homeland Security and includes strong accountability measures which were nonexistent under the Republican majority. 
   He has threatened to veto the rail and transit security bill, H.R. 1401, which requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop plans to protect rail and mass transit and authorizes $6 billion over 4 years in grants to protect those systems. We don't have a system in place to protect rail and mass transit. 
   In south Florida, we don't have a really strong mass transit system. You do in the major populations across the country. How many times have you been on a train and been checked or gone through security? There are no security measures around our rail system. We proposed legislation to do that, and the President is threatening to veto that. 
   The Dubai Ports bill, maybe people have forgotten about the proposal that the administration was completely supportive of and allowed to sail through their FISA process that would  have allowed essentially a state foreign-owned company to own port terminals in America. I mean, that just sailed through the administration's process. They basically ignored Federal law and allowed it to happen. We passed a law to tighten that. That passed 423-0. No threat to veto there. We weren't going to allow that situation to continue. We need to ensure foreign countries do not own our port terminals and further undermining our security in America. 
   Now we have passed the military construction appropriations bill that would ensure that we have the largest single increase in veterans health care in American history, in addition to the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act which responds to the Walter Reed scandal, also ignored by the Republicans. That passed 426-0, but it took Democrats to pass that legislation. 
   Really what this is about is who is for homeland security and who is just talk; who is for homeland security and who is just kidding. At the end of the day, actions are what speak louder than words. It is what you learned in kindergarten: Follow what people do, don't just listen to them talk, talk, talk. We have to show the American people what the Democrats are trying to accomplish that Republicans and this President is trying to block.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Student Loan Sunshine Act, and I congratulate Chairman Miller for bringing the principles of honest leadership to higher education financing. 
   The cost of higher education has increased dramatically over the past few years, making college less affordable for many families. Financial aid is an important tool in helping make the cost of college more affordable. The people and institutions that administer these loans must be held to the highest ethical standards. For most students, their college loan will be their first form of major debt after their graduation. 
   As we encourage financial literacy and responsibility among this generation of young people, we must ensure that students are protected. They need to understand and know that their lenders and their financial aid administrators are in their corner and that they don't have individuals that are trying to undermine them or make money on the backs of these students. 
   Financing a college education is dependent on industry and institutional accountability. Strict codes of conduct will ensure this accountability. 
   Additionally, I am also supportive of the Department of Education's efforts to install new safeguards to protect students' privacy. We need to make sure that our students can have the utmost confidence in the system that is designed to provide them the opportunity to pay off their loans after their education and go on to become productive members of our society.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you so much, Mr. Altmire. 
   I have to tell you what a pleasure it is to have the reinforcements in you and Mr. Murphy and a number of other Members, you, Madam Speaker, to have been elected on November 7 to bolster the efforts of the 30-Something Working Group. Because we hung in there for the last couple of cycles and took to the floor every night to talk to the American people and to our colleagues on this floor about the issues that we believed were important to them that were not being addressed by our colleagues and good friends on the other side of the aisle when they were in charge. 
   I want to follow up on what you and Mr. Murphy have just been discussing relating to the President and his attitude. The conclusion that I have reached is that it must be that the President has contempt for the democratic process. I can't really reach any other conclusion besides that. 
   Because we are not a monarchy. He hopefully realizes that he was not elected king. He is not self-appointed. He is one of three branches of government that are coequal, coequal meaning we have as much say and as much right to weigh in on something as significant as whether to, A, commit our troops to war, and, B, we control the appropriations, we control the purse. 
   And what we believe, as Democrats, is that it is irresponsible for us to give this President a blank check and an open-ended commitment to the Iraqi government with absolutely no accountability and no requirement that there be progress forward or benchmarks met. I mean, the President must believe that we aren't listening to our constituents, or maybe he's not listening. He says he is listening. In fact, on April 24 of this year the President said this, ``Last November, the American people said they were frustrated and wanted change in our strategy in Iraq. I listened.'' 
   Really? I have yet to see any evidence of him listening. What I have seen evidence of, and, you know, I know that I often go back to the analogy of my interaction with my own children when talking about this President, but my frustration and observation about the insolence on occasion of my own children is similar to what we have been observing from the reaction from this White House. 
   I really can analogize it that when I am talking to, for us as the Democratic majority in Congress, we sent him legislation in the supplemental appropriations bill that he vetoed. And I have the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee and served on the conference committee. We sent him the legislation with a timeline for withdrawal, with his own benchmarks as he outlined on January 10, with accountability and with protection for our troops, A, ensuring that they not have a tour of duty without a 365-day separation in between those tours, the Army's own rules. We made sure that there was $1.7 billion in funding for veterans' health care. We made sure that there was $1.7 billion in there for military health care, something that you have been incredibly concerned about, veteran and military health care, Mr. Altmire. And on and on. The issues that were, according to the President, very important to him and clearly important to the American people. 
   And so he vetoed that and said that there were other concerns that he had, that he didn't want his hands tied, that he wanted to have the flexibility, that he just wanted a blank check and open-ended commitment. We, being a coequal branch of government, have gone back to the drawing board. And the Democratic majority believing in compromise and a need to negotiate in good faith, we have now put forward another proposal, a proposal that is designed to address the concerns that he outlines. 
   And normally when you're going through a good-faith negotiation there is what's called ``back and forth,'' for example, the analogy that I began a minute ago, when my children don't like what I'm telling them, when I'm talking to my kids and I explain to them that I want them to do A and they don't want to do A, and we kind of go back and forth. And being a parent of small children, sometimes it's a dictatorship, but sometimes there's negotiation. And it always works better when you can work things out with your kids and teach them that compromise is going to get you further. But when they don't like that compromise, my kids, just like all kids, stamp their foot and whine a little bit and tell me that they don't want to do that. 
   That really feels like how this President has reacted to Congress' clear ability to weigh in on the direction that this war should be taking. The American people certainly have weighed in. And what I don't understand is why the President isn't willing to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. The my-way-or-the-highway attitude that he has taken is irresponsible. 
   What we are doing in this next proposal is we are making sure that we fully fund over the next 3 months the  funding that the troops need. We provide the President and the Army with the funding that they need, but we tie it to benchmarks, we tie it to progress. The Iraqi government cannot believe that we will be there forever. 
   And then we have a second vote where we would come back; and if the President can certify to us that those benchmarks are being met, then the rest of the funding would be released. If he can't certify that to us, then the funding that we would appropriate would be used to go through a redeployment process. 
   Because at some point the madness has to end. That is what the American people have told us when we've gone home to our districts in town halls, in e-mails, in phone calls. The President appears to have ear plugs in his ears, and it's wrong. And that's why the Founding Fathers established coequal branches of government, so that one person in the executive office, in the Oval Office could not unilaterally decide to commit our troops, to keep them there and to engage us in military action indefinitely. It's irresponsible. 
   Mr. Murphy.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I am really glad that you touched on that, because you read my mind. I am obviously from a State where the National Guard and its readiness is imperative. We are approaching June 1st, which is the beginning of hurricane season. It runs all the way through to the end of November. I know from conversations that I have had with our Guard leadership in Florida that a good amount of our equipment is over in Iraq still. And to make matters worse is that the equipment that has come back is in such horrendous shape that it is almost unusable. 
   When I had a meeting in my district office with the head of our National Guard, with the commander, this was over a year ago, he expressed that concern to me over a year ago. We can't deal with the lack of readiness in Kansas but certainly not in a State like Florida where we are in the middle of hurricane alley. And we have already had the first main storm today, three weeks before the hurricane season even begins. 
   So we are not just talking about the foreign policy impact, the perception of our Nation across the world or the impact on our troops. There is a domestic impact, a significant detrimental domestic impact to our inability to address where we are in this war and when it is going to end. 
   We have got to make sure that the Iraqi government and the Iraqi troops are in a position to stand on their own so that we can bring our troops home and deal with the domestic needs that we have in this country.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. 
   You know, I really became enraged this weekend because you both have heard me refer to myself as what I am, and that is a ``minivan mom.'' I am a minivan mom, one of the millions of minivan moms that drive around my district with the kids in the back seat. And I can tell you that we, ideally, if you are a mom with little kids, would drive a smaller vehicle so that you could save gas, so that you could save money, so that you could be more energy efficient and environmentally conscious. 
   However, when you are traveling from soccer to baseball to dance class to school and all the things that minivan moms have to do, you need a vehicle the size of a minivan. And they are expensive to fill up. Believe me. 
   This weekend, we were back up, just for 87 octane, when I filled my gas tank, 87 octane in my hometown of Weston was $3.06 a gallon. The 93 octane was about $3.88. I stood there, and it had been a while since we felt the rage and actually a while since I have gotten feedback from constituents about their frustration, because, like you said, I am actually an idealist. I am not a cynic. I am not someone that believes in conspiracy theories. 
   There is just no question in my mind that that drop in gas prices was absolutely tied to the potential fortunes of the Republican candidates for Congress and this administration. So I am just going to say it straight out. 
   The only explanation other than that and the only explanation for the insensitivity on the part of the President and this White House must be that they are not filling their own tanks. Maybe their drivers are doing it for them. 
   I would like to take the opportunity to introduce our colleagues and the President to a gas tank. This is what they look like. And when you insert the pump into your vehicle, the indicator on the gas pump shows you how much you are paying and shows you the total at the end after you are done filling your tank.     
   They are not filling their own tank. That must be the only explanation why the President hasn't taken any steps to address our dependence on foreign oil, to deal with the record profits, obscene profits that the oil industry is making. 
   I don't understand how he could look himself in the mirror after the 2006 State of the Union which I was here for and you guys were running to join us here. I heard President Bush stand at that lectern and tell us that we must end America's addiction to foreign oil. It clearly was just words. That is what they are good at. They are good at the words. They just are not good at backing up the words with action. But we are. Here we are talking about what we need to do. I want us to share with our colleagues and other folks that might be listening what our plans are, because we are going to take some action.  
   We represent the folks that drive minivans around their district and drive pickup trucks and who run small businesses who need to make sure that gas prices don't cut their legs out from under their business and prevent them from being able to function. That is the reality on the ground every day. 
   Your gas prices go up, you have a harder time choosing to provide your employees with health insurance, you have a harder time being able to buy that piece of equipment your business needs. There is a direct result on small businesses from gas prices going up. 
   We are taking several significant steps. The Speaker has created a Select Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence. That was a controversial move but something that she felt was important because it is so critical that we address the issue of global warming and energy independence that we needed to highlight it and put it up on a pedestal and get Members to travel the world and talk about how we can move the ball down the field and address this issue. 
   In addition to the hearings and oversight that select committee will be doing, and that select committee will meet for a year time period because there needs to be action taken within a very short time span so we can get some results for the American people. 
   Also, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, we will be hearing Mr. Stupak's legislation called the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act to immediately provide relief to consumers and prevent the oil companies from price gouging like what is clearly going on here. I mean, we cannot allow the oil industry to put our constituents on the roller coaster ride that they are clearly on right now. 
   We have to do a number of things. We have to set an example in this institution. Speaker Pelosi has moved forward with the Greening the Capitol Initiative. I am privileged to chair the subcommittee which will be working on a lot of the initiatives for the Greening the Capitol project. 
   What we will be doing is within the next 2 years, by the end of the 110th Congress, we will establish policies that will make our Capitol complex carbon neutral; and we will make sure that we set an example for businesses across the country. We have to take several major steps to provide relief and balance and focus on alternative energy research so we can truly wean ourselves off dependence from foreign oil and not just talk about it. 
   I am a little hot about that. I see the Speaker is standing on her feet, which means we are probably getting close to the end of our time.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I think what is important for us to emphasize in the 30-Something Working Group here is we are about action. Our Democratic leadership under Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn, our whip, and Mr. Emanuel, our caucus Chair, we spend a lot of time on this floor. The people who are watching see us doing a lot of talking. I mean, talk i 
   nice, but I want us to make sure that we are getting across what we are going to be doing about this problem. 
   The Speaker has made a commitment that has directed the committees that are chaired by Democratic Members that, by July 4, that we will expand and extend renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, that we will make efforts to make our Nation's farmers leaders in reducing our independence on foreign oil by promoting clean, domestically produced alternative fuels. 
   They do that in Brazil. Brazil has become completely independent of foreign oil. In fact, our own auto industry, our American automobile industry manufactures vehicles to be driven in Brazil because they use an ethanol-based gasoline so they can be self-sufficient. It is entirely doable. 
   We need to refocus, and our policies and committee hearings and legislation that will be moving through by Independence Day will move us in the direction of changing our dependence from the Middle East to the Midwest in our country. 
   We will also provide incentives for an energy-innovation economy that will create new jobs and efficiency measures to help consumers and small businesses reduce energy costs. And we are going to make sure that we strengthen our national commitment to energy research and development for the next generation of high-risk, high-reward energy technology. 
   We have an innovation agenda that was part of the New Direction for America agenda that we ran on and talked about in race after race in district after district. People want to know that it is not just words, that it is not just lips flapping up here. We are going to actually move legislation and use our congressional oversight capability and leadership on this issue so they don't hear one more quarter go by where they see record profits from the oil industry, one more quarter go by where they are on a roller coaster ride for gas prices. 
   We need to make sure that we help our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle and the President of this country knows what a gas tank is. Because Mr. Altmire did make reference that this is a gas tank, but this is a pretty ancient gas tank. This is a representation of a gas tank that probably dates back to the 1950s. Perhaps that is the last time that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle or the President actually used one of these. That really is, I think, the only explanation for their insensitivity. 
   It is our job to make sure that we move this innovation agenda forward so we can make it a priority. That is why rolling back those subsidies were part of our 6 in '06 agenda. 
   One of the first bills that we passed in the first 100 hours in the majority was a repeal of the subsidies that were given away to the oil industry that they literally said they did not need. How could they need them? They are sitting on piles of money, billions of dollars, and we gave them subsidies. We gave them back money that they owed us, that were royalties that we should have earned because we give them the right to drill on government-owned land. 
   It is just unbelievable that the priorities of the administration would be closer to the oil industry than it would be to the people. It is immoral. It really is. It is nothing short of immoral. 
   We have to start thinking about how the decisions we make here impact real people. We stand in this Chamber every day. And you know what happens? I was in the legislature in Florida. My district is 450 miles from the capitol in Tallahassee, and it is a lot further from Washington. It becomes really easy, I think, for a lot of the Members to forget the impact of the decisions that we make in this room on real people. You can easily become desensitized. Maybe that is what it is. 
   I know the President goes around the country and talks to people. But the way they set those events up for the President, as I understand it, he is isolated. They screen a lot of the people that get an opportunity to be in the room with him, if not all of them. I just don't think he hears from enough people about the true impact of his policies. It is the only explanation. 
   If he was really hearing what people were saying and if he was really sympathetic to the plight of people who are struggling, and not just poor people, but we are talking about middle-class people who have a job and who are, like you said, living paycheck to paycheck, and even people not living paycheck to paycheck. 
   Just because you can afford to pay $55 to fill up your gas tank doesn't mean it is okay. It shouldn't cost that much. It doesn't have to, and we need to make sure that our actions become reality and that we put pressure on the President to sign what we send him when we send it by Independence Day.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Just what all this boils down to for me is just one word, and that is insensitivity. I mean, there is a disconnect, which is almost a word that has almost become cliche, but a disconnect between what is really going on in the lives of the average American person and the policies that the White House and the President advance. 
   And that insensitivity, it is not isolated just to the price of oil. It is not isolated just to the President's believing that he is the only one that is right, and he was elected to be the decision-maker, as he said, and to heck with anyone else's opinion. The insensitivity is reflective, and it permeates every decision they make. 
   Let me just give you an example. I sit on the House Judiciary Committee as well, and tomorrow we have Attorney General Gonzales coming in front of our committee for our regular oversight of the Department of Justice. So the insensitivity and the tone deafness extends to even an issue like that. 
   The White House has defended their firings of the U.S. attorneys, essentially saying they had the right to do it, and they told us whatever reasons that they decided to release those U.S. attorneys, but they got caught in a fabrication. They got caught in a whole series of different stories that have come back to bite them. 
   Now we have a situation where we have an Attorney General who has completely undermined our ability and the American people's ability to have any confidence and trust in what he says. That is a pattern that exists. I mean, we talked during the campaign and during the 109th and the 108th about the culture of corruption. I mean, that is what has been hanging over this Capitol, which finally we have been able to lift it. 
   There are still remnants of it. We still have, sadly, a number of even our colleagues who have been accused of things and are going through investigations, but the Department of Justice and the Attorney General could have handled this U.S. attorney issue in a very simple way, a way that I do not think I could have or you could have questioned. 
   They had the right to decide to change who was sitting in those offices, who was serving as a U.S. attorney, and all they had to say was, we wanted to change the leadership in those eight offices. Instead, they got so caught up in telling a story that they thought was legitimate enough, that now it is not the firings, it is the coverup that is the problem. And that is what the White House does not seem to get. 
   We are almost talking apples and oranges. They are defending their right to have fired them. We are not disagreeing with them over their right to have fired the U.S. attorneys. We do have a serious problem, and we should have a serious problem not being able to trust that the information the administration and the Department of Justice provides to us when we ask them questions is accurate and that it is factual. 
   It is the trust and the violation of that trust that has been undermined for so long, and that was another result on November 7. Part of the result of the election is that the American people's confidence in their government was so badly undermined that they  wanted us to help them move in a new direction. 
   So it is just not isolated just to the issues we have been talking about tonight. We could go through a laundry list.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker and Members, colleagues, I am pleased to open this hour for the 30-Something Working Group, look forward to my fellow colleagues joining me as we progress through the hour. 
   We come to the floor tonight to talk about a variety of important issues. We are proud and pleased that we sent an economic stimulus package that was developed in a bipartisan fashion, in a bipartisan spirit, this evening to the President of the United States. It was a process that was long negotiated and hard fought, but we were able to make sure that we focused on the priorities of the American people during a difficult time economically. 
   The focus of this economic stimulus package was threefold, and they all begin with ``t.'' First, an economic stimulus package that we passed had to be ``temporary.'' We have to make sure that we can get a temporary infusion of cash into the hands of the middle class and people who will spend that money, and make sure that we can stimulate the economy. 
   It has to be ``targeted.'' It has to make sure that we were getting it into the hands of people who were actually going to spend that money, not people that were going to invest it, not people that necessarily were going to just pay off bills or sit on the money, but people who were going to use it to spend on items that they needed and get that infusion of cash into the economy so that we can have a short-term stimulus. 
   And, finally, the third ``t'' in the three-legged stool is that it had to be ``timely.'' We had to do it soon and quickly because in order to either stave off a recession, or address the one that we're in, depending on which side of the debate you're on, on whether we're in a recession or headed towards one, we needed to make sure that we did this in a timely fashion and made sure that we can get that cash into people's hands over the next couple of months. And now we look forward to that happening. 
   Let me walk Members and others through the process that we went through. This was truly a bipartisan effort. It continued the bipartisan spirit that Speaker Pelosi and our majority leadership have been making an effort at extending our hand across the aisle since taking over the majority a little over 1 year ago. 
   In December of last year, the House, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, held a House Democratic Economic Forum to talk about the dire straits that the economy was facing to really hear about what issues Americans were struggling with and to begin to figure out what we could do on a short-term as well as a long-term basis.     
   After the beginning of December, we had ongoing discussions between the House leaders and the administration through Treasury Secretary Paulson. There were intense and heavy discussions because everyone knew that something needed to be done. The devil is always obviously in the details. 
   But we came together, the administration as well as the Republican and Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives, we came together and came up with a bipartisan solution. 
   There was a Democratic leadership letter to President Bush that was sent on January 11 urging the President to work with us and make sure that we could pass an economic stimulus package that was timely and targeted and that we made sure that it got money into the hands of people who would spend it. 
   We saw that Pelosi had a meeting with the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and he testified in the House of Representatives on January 14 and thereafter, and the message that he sent was that an economic stimulus package was essential and would be helpful in order to deal with the issues that the economy is struggling with. 
   After that, we had a meeting between Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner, and they were able to reach an agreement and move in the direction until we finally reached today where we are able to pass the economic stimulus package, send it to the President, and over the next couple of months, I believe the timing is around May of this year, we will see that those funds get into the hands of people who need it the most. 
   One of the most exciting things about this package is that it is not going to go to the wealthiest few. It is not going to go to people who are just going to put it into the stock market or sit on it or just pay off bills or use it to pad fat bank accounts. We were able to successfully negotiate that the people who received this economic stimulus, these economic stimulus funds, we were able to stretch it all the way down to people who earn only $3,000. I mean, that is a category of person who truly fits the definition of needing the economic assistance. People who will be able to use those funds to make sure that they can address their everyday needs and spend those dollars so that we can put it an injection of cash into the economy and begin to revitalize it. 
   We made sure that we also provided some assistance for people who are struggling with housing issues and with mortgage issues by making sure that the FHA has a wider ceiling of mortgages in which they can provide loans to people. We have raised the cap to up over $700,000, recognizing that the range of the cost of housing is wide across the country. 
   It's good to see Mr. Altmire, and I'm glad you have joined us tonight. I know that the average price of a house in my district, in my community right now is over $300,000, which, obviously, without an economic stimulus package raising that cap would make it difficult for someone to qualify under the FHA's criteria. But we were able to make sure that we raised that cap for 1 year so that we could address in a short-term way the third T, which was ``temporary,'' in a short-term way address the economic problems that people are struggling with right now. 
   And we have continued the bipartisan tradition through the economic stimulus package because last year, when we began and took over the majority, we adopted the 6 in '06 agenda. 
   In the first 100 hours of our taking over the majority of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Congress  acted on issues important to Americans, and the Republicans on the other side of the aisle joined with us in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Mr. Murphy has joined us as well. 
   Let's walk through some of the bipartisan cooperation that we've had over the last years because there is a lot of words thrown around about how this is an institution that is being run by Democrats and that there is not bipartisan cooperation. Let us just show where the proof is in the pudding here. 
   We implemented the 9/11 Commission's recommendations which, in previous years, this was a report that was sitting on the shelf gathering dust with the Republicans refusing to put that on the floor and adopt up that legislation. We put it on the floor. It passed 299-128 with 68 Republican votes. 
   We had an average of over 60 votes for every one of these bills. Raising the minimum wage, H.R. 2. It passed 315-116 with 82 Republican votes. 
   The funding for enhanced stem cell research, which unfortunately President Bush saw fit to veto. That was H.R. 3. it passed 253-174 with 37 Republican votes. 
   We passed legislation to make prescription drugs more affordable, so that we could allow the Federal Government to negotiate for lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry which, by the way, is currently prohibited in Federal law. We passed that legislation with 255-170 with 24 Republican votes. And the list goes on. 
   Cutting student loans in half. That was H.R. 5. Passed 356-71 with 124 Republican votes. 
   And, lastly, we passed the energy package, which was the effort that we are making to recognize that global warming, yes, global warming, truly is a problem and we are committed to ending our addiction to foreign oil. Adopted the CAFE standards, the first time that we adopted some improved CAFE standard in 30 years. 
   H.R. 6 passed 264-163 with 36 Republican votes. In that legislation, the CAFE standards was legislation that was passed a few months later. And in this bill we said that we were not going to allow $14 billion in subsidies to be returned to the oil industry so we could make sure that we start to address the high cost of fuel. 
   So we are very proud of our record, our bipartisan spirit of cooperation, which culminated this evening and will continue, we hope, through the rest of this election year by passing that economic stimulus package. 
   I'm happy to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. And that's the direction we are going to continue to go in, because that line in the sand that you referred to, we have got to draw one. And the place that we draw it is a real commitment to making sure that we move back into a surplus situation like we were in before this administration took us to hell in a handbasket. I mean, let's take a look at the deterioration that our budget has gone through over the last number of years. 
   We had a situation where the budget has deteriorated by $8.8 trillion under Republican policies. In the 2001 fiscal year, we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. Literally leading into President Bush taking office, we were in a $5.6 trillion surplus. 
   Now, over the time of this administration, which is approaching 7 1/2 , almost 8 years, we have gone from a $5.6 trillion surplus to a $3.2 trillion deficit.     
   Now, if there is anyplace that I think that this Democratic majority will draw a line in the sand, it's here, so that we can make sure we take our established policies and adopt a budget and a plan and a blueprint to get us back to a surplus situation.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Exactly. And let's detail some of those facts, because the mythology that you just laid out, which is that it's Republicans that are fiscally responsible and that it's Democrats that cause debt, let's take the reality of the Bush administration's responsibility and stewardship of our fiscal house over the last several years. 
   This administration, under President Bush's leadership, is responsible for the five biggest deficits in American history. Now, there was a whole lot of talk, Mr. Altmire, as you recall over the last year or so, from this administration about how they were going to get us out of debt over the next 4 or 5 years. Right? Well, the third highest deficit that exists is proposed in the budget document that President Bush submitted to the Congress on Monday at $407 billion. The only two higher deficits that were projected were last fiscal year and in fiscal year 2004, when it was $413 billion. We're going in the wrong direction.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Put the chart back up because I think it's important to note that when we began using this chart, it was actually at $1.03 trillion and the bar was a little bit lower. Now, here on this chart it's 1.19, and it's really $1.33 trillion in foreign debt. The bar is up to the President's chin. It's actually, the 1.33 I think is up to his lips. He's about to drown in the debt right here on this chart. So we really need to make sure, I mean, there are deficits and there is debt, both are significant, both are important, and both really hamper our long-term security. 
   When we talk about the need for homeland security, economic security for Americans is equally as important. If we can't rely on our government and our leadership in the government to make sure that we make responsible fiscal decisions like we did when we reinstituted the PAYGO rules, when we made sure that the bills that we pass here are paid for and that we, going forward, aren't going to cause more debt and more deficits and saddle that burden of debt on future generations, that's what fiscal responsibility is all about; that's what financial security is about. 
   Every single day Americans have to make sure that they don't spend more money than they take in, and we have families across the country who make sacrifices in order to be able to do that. They know they're in trouble if they go in the opposite direction. This administration has spent like drunken sailors and really, to be honest with you, treated the resources that we have like it's Monopoly money, like it's not real, like it grows on trees. I mean, I guess once you get into the trillions, Mr. Murphy, that's a hard concept to grasp, $3 trillion.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I'm glad you asked that question, Mr. Altmire, because some of these concepts are hard to grasp. I know they're hard for me to get my mind around sometimes. Like I said, $3 trillion, which is the budget that this President proposed this year, and $407 billion in deficit. On top of that, a $1.33 billion foreign debt; that is money that we owe to foreign governments. 
   Let's look at just who it is that we owe this money to: $644.3 billion of that is owed to Japan. China, almost $250 billion, China, through 11/05. And then China now, $350 billion. Great Britain and the U.K., $240 billion. The Caribbean, right nearby, our neighbors very close by, we owe $68 billion to them; $63 billion to Taiwan. The OPEC nations, where we're trying to move in the direction of weaning ourselves off our dependence on foreign oil, the nice words that the President put in his State of the Union a couple of years ago that we all heard, well, $100 billion of our debt is owed to the OPEC nations. $70 billion to Korea, $53.9 billion to Hong Kong, and $52.5 billion to Germany. 
   So we have a lot of our debt spread all over the world. And we're supposed to be the strongest and most vibrant Nation in the entire world, and we have a lot of hands all over us world-wide. And it is not a good situation to be in. It's a tenuous situation to be in, and it's fiscally irresponsible. And we've got to make sure, and we're committed as Democrats under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, to move us in the right direction and get us out of that debt.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. That's exactly right. And it's important to show this debt and the impact of it in different ways because different people think and look at things through a different prism. 
   So the second highest line item in the budget that he submitted was the interest on the debt. And as you can see, like Mr. Altmire pointed out, we're at about $240 billion, which is the net interest that we're paying on that debt.     
   Now, expressed comparatively to the other things that we believe are incredibly important in terms of improving the quality of life of people in America and moving this country in a new direction, which is what we were committed to doing when we took over the majority and that we promised the American people that we would do, so we are at $240 billion in net interest on the debt. That is as compared to what we spend on education, what the President proposes to spend on education, which is at about, let's say, a little less than $50 billion, a little bit less than that for spending on veterans health care, and then a little bit less than that on homeland security. 
   Now, what's mind-boggling is, if you listen to this administration and to this President and to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you would think that the most important thing on the planet to them is homeland security and making sure that we provide adequate funding for homeland security. Well, if you take education, veterans health care, and homeland security combined, combined those items don't equal the payment of interest on the national debt. 
   I mean who is for homeland security and who just talks? I mean you have to back up words with action. We do all this right out in the open. People can see where the priorities are because, as the Speaker always talks about, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Altmire, the Speaker always talks about how the budget is an expression of our values. And we are going to show the American people the difference in our values as Democratic Members of Congress, who are the leaders of this coequal branch of government, versus the expression of values that President Bush put forward on Monday, which clearly are dramatically different than the priorities of the American people.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. If I could just reclaim my time for one second because different people would have different definitions of ``slash.'' So since we know actually by what percentage he slashed it, let's underscore. The Department of Homeland Security State responder grants that he slashed, he slashed by 78 percent. So we're not talking about just a little nick here. We're talking about cutting the legs out from under a program that provides assistance for homeland security efforts locally, not just for New York and Los Angeles and the places with big tall buildings, but places all over this country which have vulnerable sites that any wise, smart-minded terrorist would love to catch a community sleeping that doesn't have a coordinated effort and a plan to make sure that they can take care of their community and ward off a potential terrorist attack, which could happen anywhere.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. All the while with the President's continuing to insist that we make the tax cuts permanent, that we extend permanent tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, to cut more of our ability to make sure that we can fund first responder grants for communities across this country, and all the while having a $407 billion deficit and a $1.33 trillion debt. I don't know. In my dictionary, fiscal responsibility, that doesn't meet any of the definitions in the dictionary that I use. Maybe the dictionary in bizarro world. Maybe there's some opposite universe. I remember when I watched Star Trek, there was a bizarro world, opposite universe episode, and everything that was one way in one universe was the opposite way in the opposite universe. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that aisle right there, maybe that side of the Chamber is actually a parallel universe, and so everything we believe is the opposite on that side. That's what it is.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Altmire, can I ask you a question? Because you were going through the details of the cuts that the President has proposed in his budget that he submitted for fiscal year 2009 on Monday. 
   There was a program that was first implemented and proposed and funded by Congress but proposed by President Clinton called the COPS program, which put 100,000 police officers on the street and made sure that we had first responders, police officers, on the streets, patrolling our communities, making sure that the streets of America were safe. And how much did President Bush propose for the COPS program in his fiscal year 2009 budget?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I have zero, because the number that I have is that he cut the entire program, 100 percent cut to the COPS program, zeros it out, so that there would be no COPS program, no funding to put police officers on the streets in our local communities. 
   It's just unbelievable. We continue to hear the rhetoric come from this administration. I mean, it's nice, happy talk. It's nice, happy talk that you can stand behind the podium and say whatever you want and live in bizarro world across the other side of the aisle and just ignore reality and squeeze your eyes shut and hope that people don't notice that what you're saying is not true.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Altmire, I have to compliment you because the people of western Pennsylvania, when they made a decision to elect you, sent a champion for our Nation's veterans to this institution. Since day one, I don't remember a day that has gone by that I have not heard you talk about the plight of our veterans and the importance of not forgetting them, and making sure that we are going to appropriately fund and adequately fund their health care needs, provide for their needs when they come back from their service to our country and continue to take care of them in the variety of ways that we should instead of forgetting them like so much dirty laundry and make sure that they don't get left behind. It is another example of the new direction that the people of America wanted. And when they elected you, that is exactly what you have delivered to them. And I know your constituents really appreciate it. 
   You mentioned the lecture, which is a good description for what the State of the Union was last week that we got from President Bush, and Mr. Murphy, I would like to say our caucus chairman, Rahm Emanuel, did a good comparison, or timeline, of where we were at the start of the administration almost 8 years ago and where we are now. He did a press conference and talked about, gave a speech, a really good speech on the floor and just showed where we were at the start and where we are now. 
   So, Mr. Murphy, I know you have some of the information in front of you, as well, just to walk people through where we were then, at the beginning of this administration. At the beginning of this administration, we started with a record $5.6 trillion surplus when President Clinton left office. And President Bush will be leaving behind, Mr. Murphy?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you. And at the beginning of the Bush administration, Mr. Altmire, we were on track to pay down all of our publicly held debt. All of it. I am not sure if you have the chart in front of you right there; but, Mr. Murphy, we were  on track to pay down all of our publicly held debt. And what is the Bush administration leaving behind?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. It is really astonishing, the dramatic difference and the swings we have gone through in the last 8 years. Who would have thought that we could go through that type of rapid deterioration? 
   How about the economy? We are certainly not facing a strong economy right now. At the beginning of this administration, as President Clinton was leaving office, Mr. Murphy, we had the strongest economy in three decades. We had 22 million jobs that had been created. We had a record surplus. We had a thriving economy by any definition. And now that we are wrapping up the Bush administration, what is this President leaving behind?

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Absolutely. And as we begin to wrap up, getting back to the lecture that you referred to earlier, Mr. Altmire, that we received from President Bush last week, the matter of transparency is incredibly important. This is a President who talked about how we need to make sure that we disclose earmarks, which we took the lead on when we became the majority and made sure that we put our names next to the earmarks that we get in the appropriations act, and we are the ones that made sure that there was full disclosure and adopted the ethics package that was the most comprehensive in American history. 
   And with this President's proposed budget this week, let's outline, and we are going to have some of these charts next week that are blown up so that people watching can see, but let's talk about what was left out of the budget, because he talked very nicely about transparency, and make sure that people really understand clearly what we are doing here. He left out of his budget any war costs, any costs for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond the first half of this year. He also left out AMT reform beyond 2008. So all of the millions and millions of taxpayers that we helped avoid be subject to that AMT tax when we passed that legislation at the end of last year, there is no fix for them. And President Bush doesn't even count them as that going forward, which we know we are obviously going to have to do. 
   It is fake. It is just, again, bizarro world. We can just make stuff up in the budget and hope that people believe that it is true. This was a fairy tale document that he gave us on Monday. The good news is that the Congress actually writes the budget when push comes to shove. 
   Then in terms of any spending policy details beyond fiscal year 2009, there was nothing detailed in this President's budget. Let's just give you, as I wrap up and then turn it over to the two of you to bring us home, let's just go through last year. In fiscal year 2008, President Bush requested $193 billion, Mr. Murphy, for the war in Iraq. And in the fiscal year 2009 budget he just proposed to us on Monday, he asked for $70 billion. Good news. We are only going to spend $70 billion on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan this year.

   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Wow, that is so exciting. Again, we have to make sure that we are honest, transparent, and forthcoming with the American people. We can't fake it. We can't gloss it over. We have to make sure that we give them the straightforward facts and be honest with them in the budget document and in everything that we do. 
   Mr. Murphy, why don't you bring us home. It is a privilege to be here again with you and Mr. Altmire, and we miss our colleagues, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek, tonight; but the 30-Something Working Group is always here to talk about the issues that are important to the American people, but particularly to our generation of Americans who are going to inherit the results of the decisions that we make here.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of The Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, and I thank Chairman SKELTON for his leadership and his dedication to the readiness of our troops and the continuing excellence of the United States armed forces. 
   The President continues to ask this Congress and the American people to ``stay the course'' in Iraq. Well, Mr. President, today the American people and the Congress say, ``No more!!'' 
   Instead, I add my voice once again to the growing number of retired military generals, the Iraq Study Group, and untold thousands of rank-and-file on the front lines who are calling for a new direction in Iraq. 
   The success of our military depends on a sound strategy. Yet, instead of fighting terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan, our armed forces are overextended after four years of refereeing a civil war in the sands of Iraq. 
   The President's escalation of this war,--his so-called ``surge''--is not working. That much is clear. Since the escalation of this war 6 months ago, more than 25,000 troops have been sent to Iraq, 600 more U.S. soldiers have died and more than 3,000 troops have been wounded. Countless thousands of Iraqis are dead, and today the violence in Iraq is at an all-time high! 
   Our troops have performed heroically in Iraq, but the Iraqi government has failed to meet any of the benchmarks endorsed by the President in January. Political reconciliation within Iraq is non-existent. A change of course is long overdue. 
   The time has come for the United States to responsibly re-deploy our troops from Iraq and to refocus our efforts on protecting Americans from terrorism. The time has come for Iraqis to take primary responsibility for their country and their security. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will do exactly that. 
   Let me be clear on one additional point. Democrats support the troops. As a Member of the Appropriations Committee, I have consistently voted to fund our troops and provide our soldiers in the line of fire with the resources they need. 
   I do this because our brave service men and women are not risking their lives each and every day for one political party or the other. They are risking their lives for America. 
   Our Nation owes our troops a strategy that is worthy of their sacrifice. But ``stay the course'' is not that strategy. It is a slogan that continues to fail them. 
   No, Mr. Speaker, if we really want to support our troops, it is now time to get them out of Iraq and re-deploy them to other areas where they can fight the terrorists who have attacked, and who continue to threaten our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson for an excellent farm bill which I support and look forward to supporting, assuming this amendment is not added to it. 
   I do have the utmost respect for the gentleman from New York and have enjoyed my time serving with him in the House of Representatives, but I rise in opposition to his amendment which provides the Cuban regime with the ability to open bank accounts in the United States and obtain visas for regime officials to visit U.S. production facilities. 
   I strongly support the farm bill, but this amendment needlessly adds a volatile political issue to this important bill. 
   Cuba is one of five countries in the world that is a state sponsor of terror, along with North Korea, Iran, Syria and Sudan. This amendment would allow access to our financial institutions by a regime that is and maintains close relationships with other state sponsors of terrorism. 
   Recently, we have been especially vigilant about not allowing access to our financial institutions since 9/11. We adopted the Bank Secrecy Act. We have made sure there are countless accountability measures to ensure that financial institutions have the ability  to protect themselves from people who would do us harm, and this amendment would go in the opposite direction. 
   Additionally, regular Cuban citizens are prohibited from engaging in private economic activity; thus, general agricultural licenses will only serve the purpose of allowing agents of the Cuban Government into the United States. 
   Finally, I want to remind Members that while the Castro regime seeks U.S. concessions to finance its existence, it has consistently rejected offers of direct U.S. humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment. The Cuban people stand at the cusp of actualizing their dreams of freedom. It is our duty to stand by them during this historic time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I am going to bring it back down a notch for a minute. 
   On Tuesday, I had the privilege to spend time with some of our Nation's finest. I traveled to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and talked with some of our soldiers who dedicated their lives to protect our Nation and gave their hearts, souls and bodies to the cause of freedom. 
   As I was driving out to the hospital, I reflected upon the changes in Iraq in the year-and-a-half since my first visit to Walter Reed. During that visit, IED was not a regular part of the American vocabulary, Mr. Speaker. Fatalities were shocking. The mounting death toll was disturbing. 
   Today, there are insurgent attacks almost every day. Iraq has descended into a deadly civil war, and almost every American has become familiar with the term IED and the deadly impact they have on the young men and women that we send to fight for us in this war. 
   The terms of war that my good friend from Indiana so well knows, the casualties, death, kidnappings, injuries, helicopter crashes, bombs, amputations, good-byes, sorrow and pain have all become commonplace. 
   We hear that another helicopter was shot down or that three more soldiers died today in Iraq, and soon enough we become numb to the true impact that  this war is having on our troops and their families. 
   These young men and women represent true honor, courage and selflessness. They also represent the incalculable cost of the war, the price tag that is not mentioned, the lives, limbs, hopes and dreams. 
   They are soldiers like a young man I met Tuesday who was travelling on foot with his convey when an IED exploded, and as he put it, blew him up. He had served in Iraq twice before, and on his third tour of duty, Mr. Speaker, he became a double amputee, lost his arm and leg. Clearly, his total experience will change him completely. 
   Another young soldier was spending time with his family when I visited. He has a 6-year-old little boy who talked to me excitedly about how his daddy was finally going to come home forever after August. He, too, had two previous tours and fell severely ill this third time. Amazingly, this soldier hopes to go over and finish his tour with his company when he is better. 
   As a mom of 7-year-old twins, my first thought when meeting this delightful little boy was that his dad had missed half his life so far, half his life. I could not help but worry that if we do not get it right soon in Iraq it will not be long before this little boy and my twins will be part of this conflict. 
   And finally, there are soldiers like the young man who shared so much with me and who sincerely explained to me that he was actually glad that he was badly injured, as opposed to his gunner, because his gunner had a wife and kids and he did not want his buddy's family to have to look into his eyes like that. He told me he wants to run for office one day, and our Nation will be better for it. 
   America's future depends upon this generation of Americans, but while they fight to protect our country, they are depending on us to protect them. They are counting on us, the United States Congress and this President, to have a plan, a strategy that gets us somewhere and to help get them home and not endlessly commit their lives and their families' lives to this war. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, today I join an overwhelming majority of the American people, a bipartisan majority of Congress and some of the President's own military leaders to raise my voice and to be the voice of the constituents, the thousands of people who I represent in the 20th district of Florida, against escalating this war in Iraq. 
   But more importantly, I raise my voice for my generation and for all the little boys and girls in America whose mommies and daddies are in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting for this country and for freedom. 
   This President owes the American people, but more importantly, these brave troops, a strategy that makes sense, that will do the job and that will help get them home. The President's policy fails that 6-year-old little boy with a heart of gold and a smile that lights up the room who only wants his daddy to come home forever. 
   I support this resolution because the explanation the President has given the American people is not good enough. I cannot help but think about the way this war is affecting not only my generation, Mr. Speaker, but the generations following mine. They, too, recognize the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform are facing. 
   Students from two schools in my district, Nob Hill Elementary and Silver Ridge Elementary, made Valentine's Day cards for the soldiers, and I got a chance to deliver them Tuesday during my visit to Walter Reed. One of these cards reads, the one right here: ``Thank you for protecting our country and me. You're the best. I would never have had the guts to fight with guns anyways. You are my hero. Forever and ever. Get well very, very soon.'' 
   These young children recognize the service and sacrifice that these warriors are making. As Members of Congress, we owe them no less. 
   It is our responsibility to provide for the common defense, and that includes vigorous debate, informed discussion and responsible public policy. 
   I support this resolution because it does just that, and Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution because the gentleman from Indiana knows better. 
   It does not require words to question patriotism. We have had plenty of implication throughout this debate on this floor on the other side of the aisle, and death by a thousand cuts is the same as direct words. It is irresponsible and unconscionable that the other side of the aisle has questioned the patriotism of the Members who disagree. 
   It is Congress' job to disagree. It is our role in the system of checks and balances, as our Founding Fathers envisioned them, unfortunately a role that was absent for the last 12 years.

   I was just taking my opportunity. You have had more than 45 minutes to an hour of your own time to discuss your own view, and each us would like that same opportunity. It is 12:40 in the morning. So I appreciate you yielding. 
   I can tell you, as I just mentioned in my remarks, that it does not require express words. By implication, there are many Members on your side of the aisle who have questioned the patriotism of any of us who disagree with the President's policy. The President's policy is inappropriate, and it is Congress' role to question to engage in vigorous oversight. That is a role that was absent for the last 12 years, and that is why the American people elected Democrats to lead this chamber on November 7 and move this country in a new direction, which unfortunately you have neglected to do.

   Linda was the first woman promoted to the rank of sergeant, the first woman promoted to rank of lieutenant and major, and the first woman promoted to the rank of chief of police for the North Miami Beach Police Department. Chief Loizzo not only broke down walls in a male-dominated profession, but she also shattered and crumbled stereotypes for women in all professions, and particularly those in law enforcement. 
   I congratulate Chief Loizzo on her retirement and thank her for her dedicated service to our community.
