<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the recent shocks to the global economy and U.S. financial institutions have revealed a major new source of investment in the U.S. economy called Sovereign Wealth Funds. These funds are the surplus savings of our trading competitors from foreign countries and have been key in bailing out major U.S. corporations like CitiGroup, Merrill Lynch, Blackstone, and so many others that have made terrible decisions and played with the people's money to abandon. Three billion dollars was invested by the Chinese, for example, just in the Blackstone Group. 
   Put into perspective, the Chinese Government, and I underline ``government,'' is projected to have more than $3 trillion by 2010 that can be used to buy our stocks, bonds, real estate, and entire corporations. They're just getting started. Put into context, the Government of China will soon have enough investment monies to buy 51 percent; that is absolute control of more than 40 percent of all the U.S.-based corporations whose stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Think about that. The Government of China literally could buy half of all the stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. And that's only China. 
   Many people in this Nation and in this Congress would strongly oppose having the United States Government buy control of two out of every five companies listed there. It would be called socialism. But how will we react if the Chinese Government buys those same companies, which is, my friends, underway? 
   Already we see China, Kuwait, Norway, and other nations buying major stakes in our banks and in investment houses, institutions that exert enormous political and economic influence in our Nation and world. Can we trust that those investments are purely for economic returns? 
   Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has repeatedly stated that this administration has no interest in knowing the details of such investments by sovereign wealth funds. The present panic in our banks and financial institutions to secure capital to offset their mortgage and credit card debacles may induce the heads of those corporations to take bailouts on virtually any terms. But we must be wiser. A head-in-the-sand ostrich policy by the United States Government is simply not acceptable. Indeed, it is reckless, and it threatens national security.  
   At a minimum, Congress and the American people need to know the details of those transactions. Thus, foreign governments investing in U.S. companies through these funds should be required to make public their activities here, just as we require of public companies in the United States. Sunshine, as always, is good public policy. And if disclosure turns away investment, then the obvious question is what was the real goal of those funds. 
   Simultaneously, Congress needs to seriously consider whether limits should be placed on foreign investments in critical U.S. industries. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China all do. They understand that foreign economic control brings with it foreign political involvement in internal affairs. 
   In sum, sovereign wealth funds are a large and growing influence in the global economy and inside the United States. They have the potential to buy absolute control of a significant portion of the United States' economy, and that is under way. For the present, we need full disclosure about their U.S. holdings and intentions. 
   Simultaneously, we need to quickly and seriously think about what limits and controls the American people, through their government, should place on such investments. 
   Strangely, last week, President Bush signed an executive order transferring his power to the Treasury Department to authorize or reject such foreign takeovers of American companies. But officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security objected to the order over the past few months saying it served business interests over national security interests. It allows Wall Street to gain an edge at the expense of national security. This Congress should not allow that. Economic and national security should go hand in hand. We cannot allow lax regulation of foreign involvement in our economy, and we cannot allow our indebtedness to foreign interests to continue to mount. 
   I would like to place two articles in the Record tonight, one from the Washington Times on January 24, entitled, ``Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority.'' 
   This is the entity at Treasury that reviews these deals. And it talks about how CFIUS is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology Corporation, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against the United States and Japanese firms. The Boston-based Bain Capital Partners would undermine U.S. national security, and this is one of the groups that's handling this. 
   Interestingly, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recused himself from this particular review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid advisor to 3Com. 
   And also I wish to place in the Record and will end, Mr. Speaker, with a January 25 Wall Street Journal article, ``Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals,'' which goes into heavy analysis of the $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street financial institutions, the bedrock of our financial system, by selling these growing sovereign wealth funds.  
   Treasury Gets New CFIUS Authority  
   President Bush yesterday signed a new executive order on foreign investment that gives the Treasury secretary, instead of the president, key power to authorize or reject purchases of U.S. companies by foreign buyers. 
   The president said the order bolsters recently passed legislation by ensuring the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ``will review carefully the national security concerns, if any, raised by certain foreign investments into the United States.'' 
   At the same time, Mr. Bush said, the order recognizes ``that our openness is vital to our prosperity and security.'' 
   Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his agency is ``happy with the final order.'' 
   ``I think it creates a process that will achieve the dual objectives of promoting investment but making sure we don't compromise our national security,'' Mr. Chertoff said from Switzerland. 
   The legislation and order are a result of a bid in 2006 by United Arabs Emirates-based Dubai Ports World to take over operation of six U.S. ports. 
   CFIUS approved the purchase but it later was canceled under pressure from Congress over concerns that terrorists might infiltrate U.S. ports through the company. Critics questioned the deal because two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were UAE nationals, and the Persian Gulf state was used as a financial base for al Qaeda. 
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, New York Democrat and a key sponsor of the CFIUS-reform law, called the new order a positive step. 
   ``I remain confident that the Treasury Department intends to follow the law as I wrote it, and have received assurances that the department is already adhering to the new reforms,'' she said. 
   The order outlines more clearly the role of the director of national intelligence (DNI) in providing CFIUS with threat assessments posed by a foreign purchase and adds a requirement for the DNI to assess ``potential consequences'' of a foreign deal involving a U.S. company. 
   However, a comparison of the new order with a draft order from October--which was opposed by U.S. national security officials--shows that CFIUS will continue to be dominated by pro-business elements of the government. 
   As late as last month, national security officials from the Homeland Security, Justice and Defense departments expressed concern the order was being co-opted by pro-business officials at Treasury, Commerce and other trade agencies. 
   A memorandum from the three national security agencies obtained by The Washington Times called for tightening the draft order's national security provisions to ``accurately reflect pro-security interests.'' 
   The final order released by the White House yesterday removed a provision that would have required the committee to ``monitor the effects of foreign investment in the United States.'' 
   One new authority in the order is a provision strengthening so-called ``mitigation agreements'' between companies. The agreements are designed to reduce the national security risks as a condition for committee or presidential approval. 
   The order states that companies involved in a U.S.-foreign transaction ``in extraordinary circumstances'' can be required to state they will comply with a mitigation agreement. 
   CFIUS currently is reviewing a proposed merger between the telecommunications equipment manufacturer 3Com and China's Huawei Technology, a company linked in the past to illegal international activities, including violations of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and industrial espionage against U.S. and Japanese firms. 
   U.S. officials said a review by the DNI's office determined the Huawei purchase, through the Boston-based Bain Capital Partners, would undermine U.S. national security. 
   3Com manufacturers computer intrusion-detection equipment used by the Pentagon, whose networks are a frequent target of Chinese military computer attacks. 
   Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recused himself from CFIUS' 3Com-Huawei review because his former company, Goldman Sachs, is a paid adviser to 3Com.   
   Lobbyists Smoothed the Way for a Spate of Foreign Deals  
   Washington.--Two years ago, the U.S. Congress pressured the Arab emirate of Dubai to back out of a deal to manage U.S. ports. Today, governments in the Persian Gulf, China and Singapore have snapped up $37 billion of stakes in Wall Street, the bedrock of the U.S. financial system. Lawmakers and the White House are welcoming the cash, and there is hardly a peep from the public. 
   This is no accident. The warm reception reflects millions of dollars in shrewd lobbying by both overseas governments and their Wall Street targets--aided by Washington veterans from both parties, including big-time Republican fund-raiser and lobbyist Wayne Berman. Also easing the way: The investments have been carefully designed to avoid triggering close U.S. government oversight. 
   Clearly, U.S. financial firms that have been deeply weakened by the credit crisis, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., need the cash. Meanwhile, investment pools funded by foreign governments, called sovereign-wealth funds, have trillions to invest. Some American politicians, though suspicious of foreign governments, deem it suicidal to oppose aid to battered financial companies. 
   ``What would the average American say if Citigroup is faced with the choice of 10,000 layoffs or more foreign investments?'' asks New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who played a central role in killing the Dubai port deal but has applauded recent foreign investment. 
   But by making investment by foreign governments seem routine, Washington may be ushering in a fundamental change to the U.S. economy without assessing the longer-term implications. Some economists warn that the stakes could provide autocratic governments an important say in how U.S. companies do business, or give them access to sensitive information or technology. Those familiar with the deals' governmental review processes say military officials worry that a foreign government, especially China, may be able to coax an executive into turning over secrets.  
   Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers counsels caution. ``There should be a very strong presumption in favor of allowing willing buyers to take noncontrolling stakes in companies,'' Mr. Summers says. ``However, it's imaginable that government-related entities [investing in the U.S.] will be motivated to strengthen their national economies, make political points, reward or punish competitors or suppliers, or extract know-how.'' 
   Sovereign-wealth funds, meanwhile, continue to seek opportunities. Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Qatar's prime minister said the oil-rich sheikdom's investment arm wants to invest $15 billion in European and U.S. banks. ``We're looking at buying stakes in 10 or 12 blue-chip banks,'' Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani told Zawya Dow Jones. ``But we will start small.'' 
   In nearly every case, American financial companies are escaping detailed U.S. government review by limiting the size of stakes they sell to government investment funds. The multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., led by the U.S. Treasury, can recommend that the president block foreign acquisitions on national-security grounds. Congress also can block deals by pressuring companies or by passing legislation. 
   Under CFIUS rules, a passive stake--one in which investors don't seek to influence a company's behavior--is presumed not to pose national-security problems. Neither is a small voting stake, usually of less than 10%. During the recent string of deals, financial companies whose investments have met those requirements have notified CFIUS and haven't had to go through 30-day initial reviews. 
   A backlash could still develop if the funds throw their weight around in U.S. companies. The government reserves the right to examine an investment even after the deal closes. 
   When the U.S. economy was riding high in 2004, sovereign money was sometimes shunned. Dubai's Istithmar investment fund was viewed warily in New York when it went hunting for real estate. In part, that is because sellers worried that Istithmar's government ownership would lend the company sovereign immunity, insulating it from lawsuits if it reneged on a contract. (As a commercial arm of the government, it wouldn't have been immune.) 
   Now Wall Street is thirsting for new capital, preferably in huge amounts and deliverable at a moment's notice. Sovereign-wealth funds look like an oasis. These government-funded pools have about $2.8 trillion in assets, which Morgan Stanley estimates could grow to $12 trillion by 2015 as Middle Eastern funds bulk up on oil receipts and Asian ones expand from trade surpluses. 
   ``You can't have a $9 trillion debt and huge trade deficit and not expect at some point you'll have to square accounts,'' says David Rubenstein, CEO of Washington-based private-equity firm Carlyle Group. Foreign savings have to go somewhere, he says: ``Better that it come to the U.S. than anywhere else.'' (An Abu Dhabi fund, Mubadala Development Corp., has a 7.5% stake in Carlyle.) 
   As the U.S. financial crisis deepened over the summer, sovereign-wealth funds became a favorite of capital-short Wall Street firms. That is because state funds presumably have an incentive to be passive investors, to avoid raising objections to their stakes. Domestic investors, on the other hand, might demand a bigger say or board seats for a similar-size stake. As it sought its most recent cash infusion of $6.6 billion, Merrill Lynch turned away possible investments from U.S. hedge funds in favor of investments from government funds from South Korea and Kuwait, say people involved with negotiations. 
   A senior official at China Investment Corp., which has about $200 billion in assets including a $3 billion stake in private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP, says it doesn't want to play an active role in corporate governance. ``We don't even want to take the kind of stand of someone like Calpers,'' which is the California state pension fund, the official said. ``We don't have enough people, and we can't send directors out to watch companies. 
   Behind Washington's acceptance of large-scale foreign investments lies a well-funded lobbying campaign, spurred when Congress objected to government-owned Dubai Ports World's investment in a U.S. port operator. The United Arab Emirates--a federation of seven ministates including Dubai and Abu Dhabi--was seared by the accusation that an Arab government-owned company couldn't be trusted to protect U.S. ports against terrorists. Last year, the U.A.E. launched a three-year, $15 million Washington lobbying campaign, the U.S.-Emirates Alliance, to burnish its reputation. 
   The alliance, headed by former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Richard Mintz, recruited about two dozen businesses to form a support group. It contributed $140,000 to a prominent Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to start a ``Gulf Roundtable'' discussion series. It also forged alliances with prominent Jewish groups by persuading the U.A.E. to clear the way for U.S. travelers whose passports had Israeli visas; such travelers sometimes had been turned away by U.A.E. customs agents, Jewish groups said. 
   Such openness has it limits, though. In June 2007, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, with an estimated $875 billion in assets, hired public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller for $800,000 for an initial eight-month contract to improve communications. But it still has no press department or press kits. It forbids its Washington representative, James Lake, to talk to the media. 
   Even as the Dubai port controversy spurred sovereign investors to engage in a charm offensive, it led lawmakers to re-examine laws governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Some proposed to vastly expand the definition of investments that could pose a threat to national security. Both foreign firms and U.S. banks lobbied fiercely in response, pressing to keep the reviews narrow enough to encourage foreign investment. 
   Their lobbying largely succeeded. The Financial Services Forum, which represents the 20 largest U.S. financial firms, focused on Sen. Schumer, a frequent Wall Street ally. In one April 2006 session, a dozen CEOs, including then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, told the senator about the importance of open investment. A participant says Sen. Schumer described the Dubai port controversy as an ``anomaly.'' Since then, executives from top financial firms have consulted with Sen. Schumer when foreign firms seek to buy stakes and regularly win his endorsement. 
   Sen. Schumer says the executives assure him that foreign investors will have ``not just virtually no control, but virtually no influence.'' 
   Compared with the ports industry, the financial sector speaks with an outsize megaphone in Congress. In the 2006 election cycle, commercial banks and securities firms, and their employees, contributed $96.3 million to congressional campaigns--32 times as much as the sea-transport industry, which includes ports, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Banks and securities firms are also the largest industry contributors to members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which can review investments in Wall Street firms. Sen. Schumer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee. 
   Wall Street and the U.A.E. thought they had turned the corner by spring 2007 when another Dubai-owned company, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., bought two firms that owned small U.S. airports and maintenance facilities that serviced some navy transport-plane engines. The Dubai firm pledged to submit to government security reviews and submit its employees for security screening. It also thoroughly briefed lawmakers on the deal. It ran into no obstacles on Capital Hill. 
   ``I call the strategy, `wearing your underwear on the outside,' '' says one of Dubai Aerospace's Washington lobbyists, Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House communications adviser. ``We have to show everybody everything--no secrets, no surprises.'' 
   The deal that provided a blueprint for the current wave of foreign investments was China's $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group's initial public offering, announced last May. In helping to gain congressional approval for the deal, lobbyist Mr. Berman emerged as a key strategist. 
   Mr. Berman, a Commerce Department official in the administration of George H.W. Bush, has been one of the Republican Party's most adept fund-raisers, bringing in more than $100,000 for President George W. Bush in 2000 and more than $300,000 in 2004. Mr. Berman cultivates a range of contacts with salon-style dinners at his home with his wife, Lea, who was Laura Bush's social secretary. He is now a fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential bid. 
   Blackstone asked Mr. Berman, a longtime lobbyist for companies in the financial industry, to help smooth the way in Congress for China to buy a piece of the private-equity firm. A minority stake made sense to both sides: Blackstone wanted to boost its presence in China. China, which was in the process of setting up China Investment Corp., wanted to show it could become a trusted investor in top U.S. firms. 
   Mr. Berman pointed out that offering a board seat, or a stake of more than 10%, would invite government review. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on a stake of as much as 9.9% and passive investment. ``Our intention was not to arouse too much sensation in any way,'' says the senior China Investment Corp. executive. 
   Mr. Berman says the goal wasn't to get around the rules but to work within them. ``Policy considerations didn't drive the specifics of the deal,'' says Mr. Berman. ``Policy considerations informed the deal.'' 
   Blackstone executives briefed several dozen lawmakers, with the firm's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, sitting in on some sessions. Stiff opposition came from Sen. James Webb, a first-term Virginia Democrat. Sen. Webb wrote a novel published in 1991, ``Something to Die For,'' in which Japan uses its financial muscle to gain influence in Washington. The senator worries Beijing could do the same. 
   Mr. Webb wanted the China investment deal delayed so regulators could examine whether Blackstone's stake in a semiconductor company posed national-security problems. One of Mr. Berman's partners pointed out that the firm produced off-the-shelf chips. Sen. Webb withdrew his objections to the deal, though he remains skeptical of sovereign investors. 
   Mr. Berman's firm, Ogilvy Government Relations, a unit of WPP Group PLC, billed Blackstone $3.9 million in 2007 for the work on the investment, tax and other issues.  
   Other deals followed, similarly structured to avoid raising congressional uproar. Two other Berman clients, Carlyle Group and Citigroup, negotiated investments with sovereign-wealth funds--both marked by passive stakes and no board seats--and faced no resistance. Mr. Berman says he didn't lead strategizing in either deal. 
   Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, in their most recent round of capital-raising, included U.S. investors, including New Jersey's Division of Investment, giving politicians even more reason to support the deals. ``The principality of New Jersey'' is now buying stakes in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, jokes Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee. 
   Other sovereign-wealth funds have turned to Washington experts for advice. Former New York Fed Chairman William McDonough, a vice chairman of Merrill Lynch, is also a member of the international board of advisers of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. Temasek has stakes in Merrill Lynch as well as British banks Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, now an adviser to Sen. McCain, is vice chairman of investment banking at UBS AG of Switzerland, which sold a stake to another Singapore government investment fund. He says he talks regularly with sovereign-wealth funds who seek his advice on dealing with Washington. 
   U.S. financial firms say the welcoming attitude of the U.S. Treasury has also helped. Essentially, the Treasury and other industrialized nations have subcontracted some of the most difficult questions concerning sovereign-wealth funds to the International Monetary Fund. In particular, the IMF is trying to persuade the funds to adopt voluntary codes to act for commercial, rather than political, reasons. 
   Presidential candidates have widely ignored sovereign-wealth funds' investments. Democrat Hillary Clinton, alone among top contenders for the White House, has addressed their downsides. ``Globalization was supposed to mean declining state ownership,'' she said in an interview. ``But these sovereign-wealth funds point in the opposite direction.'' She wants to go beyond the IMF efforts and look into a ``regulatory framework'' for the investments. 
   Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday that his committee would be ``examining'' sovereign-wealth-fund investments. So far, the only congressional hearing on the funds was held by Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. ``No one wants to rock the boat,'' Sen. Bayh says, because flagship financial institutions need the cash. 
   Still, he is skeptical of the sovereign money. ``If you had unfettered U.S. government investments in markets, you'd have people throwing around words like socialism,'' says Sen. Bayh. ``With foreign government investments, the silence is deafening on all sides.''

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (NAFTA EXPANSION TO PERU -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the proposed Bush NAFTA expansion to Peru provides no path to job growth in the United States or to correcting the growing U.S. trade deficit with Peru. The Bush proposal will yield the same result: more outsourced U.S. jobs, growing trade deficits, more landless Peruvian farmers, rising coca production, more illegal immigration, continued decline in the quality of life on both continents, and enrichment for a narrow band of political and multinational elites. 
   The proposed Peru agreement keeps intact some of the most offensive NAFTA-CAFTA provisions, such as prohibiting Congress from passing legislation to promote ``buy American'' or to prevent the offshoring of more of our jobs. We keep asking ourselves: If you keep getting the same bad result, why keep enacting more of the same kinds of laws? 
   The agreement even amplifies the CAFTA provisions regarding foreign investors being able to procure government contracts and settle disputes outside of U.S. courts. I find it unacceptable that the agreement handcuffs this Congress as it attempts to protect the interests of the people who send us to represent them. That's supposed to be our job. 
   On a number of fronts, the Peru Free Trade Agreement stands to cause more harm than good. Take worker rights. The agreement merely commits Peru to hortatory, nonbinding language in the preamble to the ILO convention, and it does nothing to assure enforcement through the actual body of the conventions that provide the real protection for workers. There are no worker protections in this draft. 
   In addition, the environmental provisions are equally inferior. All of the major environmental groups oppose the agreement, but for a couple who receive heavy corporate contributions. Would this have anything to do with the fact that the Andalusian pipeline that will bring more oil and gas out of Latin America might have something to do with this agreement? 
   Importantly, in agriculture, as Oxfam points out, ``the agreement will harm many thousands of Peru's farmers,'' just as in Mexico millions of farmers have been harmed who then flock to the United States to find any kind of sustenance. Though some American farmers think they will stand to benefit from the zeroed-out tariffs, many don't understand that the MERCOSUR customs agreement between Peru and its neighbors will allow pork to flow in there from Argentinean and Brazilian imports. So I would think that our pork producers should be very skeptical that they're going to claim the largest share of that market. 
   Now, where are these displaced Peruvian farmers supposed to turn? Perhaps, in their desperation for a profitable crop, they will help Peru reclaim its title as the world's number one coca producer. Or perhaps they will follow the same path as Mexico's abandoned corn and bean farmers and migrate to the overcrowded cities of the United States, legally or not. 
   President Bush's Peru deal continues the bad trade policies that leave our consumers vulnerable to food safety catastrophes. Peru places second to China in its fisheries, and plenty of Peruvian seafood imports to our country are rejected due to filth, salmonella and equally disturbing criteria. Indeed, 27 percent, a third of all Peruvian antibiotic lines imported to this country already are found to be tainted and rejected. Why would we want more? 
   Until now, Democrats have stood united against President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security in the United States; yet the proposed Peruvian agreement effectively endorses and solidifies Peru's privileged and privatized and severely flawed system. Giant multinational banks such as Citibank that invest in these private investor accounts would, under the Peru agreement, be entitled to compensation if privatization were reversed. 
   Despite all of these concerns, instead of holding a formal hearing on such far-reaching legislation for a country  of 28.7 million people, half of whom live below the severe poverty line, the Ways and Means Committee instead held what's called a mock markup session last week. There were no recorded votes. It was a mock session. No recorded votes. No Member outside of the committee was invited to testify or comment, and they kept the old fast track procedure where they're going to bring it up here and not allow any amendments. It's another inside deal, because if you really had a full deal, a square deal, a fair deal, the majority of Members of this Congress would not vote for it, so they have to put handcuffs on everybody in order to try to maneuver it through here. 
   Had I been allowed to submit testimony on the record at the hearing, I would have voiced my strong opposition to this NAFTA-style agreement that is destined to further exploit the struggling working classes in Peru and the United States. Unless it results in new jobs for our country and growing trade balances, rather than more deficits, no Member should support it. Any trade agreement that passes here should have mutually beneficial approaches which yield trade balances and jobs in our country. 
   I'd ask my colleagues to defeat this exploitative NAFTA expansion model for Peru.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I rise today in reluctant opposition to the rules on both housing bills that are before us because they are not coming up before us in regular order. Neither one is an open rule on such an important subject. 
   I truly want to thank Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters for their efforts to improve these bills as they move forward. But on a matter so serious, the membership should be afforded the respect our offices bestow to represent their people and be allowed to amend and be heard in this body.     
   Every day, between 7,000 and 8,000 American households lose their homes to foreclosure. Meanwhile, the banks responsible are being rescued by the Federal Reserve, an instrument of our government. Today, the major bills before us to assist with foreclosures will unleash the power of the taxpayer-insured Federal Housing Administration to catch some of the homeowners in its rescue net. But these bills do nothing to hold the lenders and servicers responsible. 
   Despite the promise of rescue hotlines and Federal and State government compacts, Federal action to help homeowners being foreclosed lacks bite. It is voluntary. It pushes to the FHA what the private sector should be making whole. 
   The two plans to be considered today, again, ask mortgage servicers to voluntarily, and I underline that word voluntarily, enter into an agreement with the FHA to insure these troubled loans if servicers offer modest loan concessions. The problem: The voluntary aspect of the program leaves homeowners yet again at the mercy of the mortgage loan holder. 
   Take Countrywide. The CEO of that company had his compensation approach over $200 million, with salaries, bonuses, options, and everything over the last 5 years. Yet the Federal Reserve still rewards Countrywide as one of its privileged primary dealers trading in U.S. Government securities. The FHA rescue plan promises to save maybe 500,000 homeowners, or half a million Americans. That equals maybe 25 percent of the more than 2 million additional homeowners still at risk of foreclosure. Let me ask, is helping 25 percent, perhaps, of homeowners at risk the best America can do? Because the bills are not being considered under an open rule with the ability to amend, we cannot perfect this legislation. 
   So it's fair to ask, where have these voluntary rescue plans gotten us so far? Housing counselors in my area tell me dozens of servicers refuse even to come to the table and return phone calls, for heaven's sake. Not restructuring the loan is one thing but not picking up the phone is another. When servicers refuse to answer the phone, no degree of local government effort or foreclosure prevention counseling can be effective. 
   Who is not picking up the phone? Some of these characters:  CitiFinancial, HSBC/Beneficial, Chase Mortgage, Countrywide, Sovereign Bank, Indymac Bank, Popular Mortgage, GMAC, NovaStar, EMC Mortgage.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   To continue ..... ASC Servicing, HomeEq, Wilshire, Nationalstar, EquiFirst, Litton Loan, Flagstar, and Saxon Mortgage Services. 
   In fact, the Federal Reserve still has among its privileged list of primary Treasury security dealers Countrywide, HSBC, and Citigroup, some of the very companies that aren't answering the telephone. 
   Banks and mortgage servicers should be mandated to disclose contact information, phone numbers, and lay services for their loss mitigation departments. Citizens attempting to do workouts on loans must have these recalcitrant institutions at the table. 
   In addition, as I've said for months, forthcoming improvements to the bill should include a short-term foreclosure moratorium, perhaps 3 months, to help hundreds of thousands of Americans avoid foreclosure. And, most importantly, Congress should vote again on allowing judges the flexibility to modify the terms of mortgage loans in bankruptcy court proceedings. Frankly, the Senate should filibuster on this issue. In other words, do for the homeowner what the Federal Reserve has done for the big banks. 
   Without enacting tougher legislation, a ``no'' vote on this rule and the one to follow will allow for a more effective set of bills to come before us that will really address the comprehensive foreclosure needs of the American people. I'm glad to see the progress we've made, but we could go so much further.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICA NEEDS TO RECAPTURE ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM FOREIGN INTERESTS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today the New York Post reported that a foreign government in the form of the Abu Dhabi Investment Council plans to buy the Chrysler Building, a New York City landmark, for more than $800 million, continuing a trend of foreign government buyouts of American business, real estate and assets. This is the same sovereign wealth fund that bailed out Citigroup earlier in this year. Recall Citigroup, America's biggest bank and a key player in recycling international petrodollars and a holder of enormous debt from the subprime lending crisis. 
   Abu Dhabi is jointly owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the National Bank of Abu Dhabi. The former chairman is Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who is pictured here on the poster with President Bush. The Sheik is the President of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi. This is not just a foreign executive buying up an American icon building. This is the ruler of a foreign country. 
   For those who are opposed to the American government owning private property, allowing foreign governments, and I underline that, to own America's priceless assets should be anathema. But the same people who advocate less U.S. Government involvement surely cannot support the meddling of undemocratic governments such as Abu Dhabi in buying up America's assets. 
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson went to Abu Dhabi earlier this month to put stardust on the state of the U.S. economy, assuring the Sheik that the United States encourages these types of foreign government investments and buyouts, even while the Secretary advocates a smaller role for the U.S. Government in our own country. Does this make any sense? 
   Abu Dhabi's investments are particularly alarming, because in addition to the Authority and Council being state-run and perhaps the largest such funds in the world, they are among the least transparent sovereign wealth funds. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, there is a ranking of the transparency of who really owns these funds and whose money is in there and what is that money doing. 
   Abu Dhabi and the UAE are at the very bottom, at the very bottom. They are the least transparent of global sovereign wealth funds. The Authority in particular has a reputation for intense secrecy, without even an internal communications department. The fund is state-run and ``does not answer to a wide public at home,'' said David L. Mack, a former United States Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. 
   How would this fund stand up to the regulations we have in place here in our own country? Would this fund be legal in the United States? How is this fund supportive of democratic principles? Abu Dhabi and the UAE are not democratic places. Without even asking these questions, this oil-hungry administration courts these investors personally. 
   Of course, sovereign wealth funds are not just in the UAE. Kuwait, Qatar and Boston Properties purchased the GM Building earlier this week. Do you see the pattern? Nor are these funds limited to the oil-rich Middle Eastern countries. In fact, one of the largest funds is Norway's. But that country, a democracy, has perhaps the most transparent and conventional investment strategy. They are at the top in terms of transparency and normal Western business and law practices. 
   China, Saudi Arabia and many funds, such as those of the UAE, invest unconventionally, are very secret. They are not transparent, even when countries like Norway set an example of responsible investment. 
   As our trade deficit swells even more, in April it deepened even more, to $60.9 billion in one month, America cannot afford to sell off any more of our country. We need to reduce our dependency on oil, balance our trade accounts and invest in our own country so that undemocratic and secretive foreign governments do not buy out our heritage. We need to recapture America's independence and stand on our own two feet again. It will require sacrifice and discipline and responsibility. 
   Freedom's clock is really ticking for this generation. Are we going to hear it? Are we going to hear it? 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the June 11, 2008, New York Post article entitled ``Chrysler Building on the Block'' for the Record.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING REBATE CHECKS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank Chairman Butterfield for yielding and for his kindness in allowing me to rise in support of H. Res. 977, encouraging Americans to expend their rebates to stimulate our economy the most by buying and investing in goods and products made right here in the good old USA. 
   Congressman Bruce Braley of Iowa is to be commended for bringing such a sensible bill to the floor. The voters of Iowa were smart to send him here. He has obtained over 106 cosponsors on this bipartisan bill. We know as we debate this today, he is out in his district trying to help the families there who have been hurt by the terrible, terrible flooding. We know he is not just working there, but he is working here as well, and has the deep respect of his colleagues. 
   Rebate checks spent here in America on American goods will better stimulate our economy. Buying American products and American services from American-owned companies, purchasing U.S. farm products produced in this country or processed here, buying U.S. Savings Bonds, if you want to save, all keep jobs and income here. Indeed, buying fuel that contains ethanol or biodiesel from U.S. farmers helps America. 
   With the U.S. trade deficit soaring towards $1 trillion in red ink, investing in America makes more sense today, and I spell that S-E-N-S-E and C-E-N-T-S, than ever before. Today we were reminded of the softness in our economy with the announcement that the Chrysler Building in New York City, one of America's historic landmarks, will be purchased by a Middle Eastern oil conglomerate from Abu Dubai, just another sign of America's shrinking independence here at home. Spending a stimulus check on foreign-made goods stimulates the Abu Dubai economy or the Chinese economy or the Mexican economy. Expending those precious dollars here at home or saving them in U.S. Savings Bonds strengthens communities across our country. 
   So I would urge my colleagues and our fellow citizens to buy America, buy made-in-America, invest in jobs here. Use your stimulus check to build a stronger Nation. Now is the hour for all good men and women to use their rebate checks to come to the aid of their country. 
   I thank the gentleman very much for yielding to me, and urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 977.

However, at the time of the vote, after voting ``no'' on the prior motion to recommit, when that vote was held open for 15 minutes I left the Chamber to locate 226 high school students from Timber Stone Junior High School in my district, who were nowhere to be found on either the east or west side of the Capitol.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (LET'S THINK ABOUT THE NUMBERS -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, when asked about the possibility of gas going up to $4 a gallon, the President of the United States and leader of the free world said, ``That's interesting. I hadn't heard that.'' 
   Yes, gas prices are predicted to top $4 a gallon, and the leader of the free world doesn't even know? Something is clearly wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, with an economy based on the fuel of yesterday, America needs new vision and leadership. We cannot rely on leaders who don't know what most Americans understand and are living every day, that our oil economy is based on borrowed time that is fast running out. 
   Let's think about these numbers. A recent Congressional Research Service paper summarized the point clearly. Researchers predict that a 10 percent increase in oil prices lowers economic growth in our country by a quarter point to a little over a point over the next four quarters, compared to a flat growth rate for oil prices. 
   When President Bush took office, gasoline cost 1.45 a gallon. Today gasoline averages $3.17 a gallon, with some analysts saying the price could reach $4 a gallon. Californians already know that. 
   The American people don't need the Congressional Research Service to do the math to understand what this means, but let's run the numbers just for the sake of argument. 
   During Bush's tenure in office, the average price of gasoline has increased over 218 percent; not 10 percent, 218 percent. With researchers predicting that a one quarter increase of 10 percent in oil prices leads to an economic contraction of a quarter percent to 1.1 percent for the following four quarters, the American people can only imagine what a 218 percent increase has meant for the American consumer over the last 7 years. It is profound. 
   In rough terms, the Bush economic stewardship plan has driven our economy into a tailspin. Our economy is in trouble. It needs rescuing. And our top leader doesn't even know prices could reach $4 a gallon? 
   We should have learned something from the first Arab oil embargo of the 1970s when the United States suffered both high unemployment and rampant inflation. President Reagan called it the misery index. Don't we remember that misery? It's being exacted on the American people again. 
   The rising prices of oil imports in 2006 and 2007 alone accounted for over $70 billion of our mammoth trade deficit. The global savings glut is being driven largely by the transfer of wealth from our country and western democracies to the oil rich kingdoms of the Middle East, and this imbalance continues to grow, and our people continue to suffer more. 
   The dollar declines. It's very clear what's happening. Gasoline prices are destroying the economic gains of our economy every day, pushing up our trade deficit and making America less competitive on the global market. 
   Every paper you open up there are layoffs in community after community after community, coast to coast, and people are losing their homes at greater rates. Without a course correction, the next generation will never be able to compete. 
   Energy legislation this House considered last week is a step in the right direction, and the other body ought to pass it quickly. But it is only a step. 
   This is the time for America to redouble our efforts and invest in an energy-independent future that uses geothermal, wind, biomass, solar, advanced vehicle research, new fuels of all kinds and new vehicles, developing the technologies of tomorrow for this new century. 
   America needs energy independence now, not in 2025, not even in 2015. We need every single elected official at the national level to be committed to energy independence now. We need a change in this Capitol city. We need a change in the White House, and we need people elected to this Congress who will save America from ruin because of the terrible toll that rising oil prices are having on the innards of this economy, in every borough, in every hamlet, in every city, in every town across this country. 
   It is high time America moved from the carbon-based economy into the carbohydrate economy, and we can't do it fast enough. 
   The sun waits to be captured. The wind across our plains needs to be put to new use, and it is renewable. It was given to us as a precious gift. We ought to use it. And we need to have elected officials who are committed to this great American quest in this new American century.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH PERU AND PANAMA -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, soon President Bush's administration will force upon this Congress consideration of free trade agreements with Peru and Panama under the fast-track process. That means no amendments allowed here in the Congress. 
   The bills they will bring before us are modeled on the flawed NAFTA model that have yielded growing trade deficits every year the Bush administration has been in office. We have seen how NAFTA sucked good jobs away from Americans, how it ravaged the Mexican countryside and triggered a flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and violence across our southern border. 
   Our staggering trade deficit with Mexico continues to grow. This year, we already have a $21.6 billion deficit with Mexico, and it will continue to swell as communities across the continent face job washout. 
   If we do not construct a new trade model that takes people into consideration and advocates free trade among free people, then it does not matter how many environmental provisions we may add to trade agreements or how unique the administration claims its labor provisions are. 
   We are simply extending NAFTA to the rain forest and to more sweat shops because there will be no reliable enforcement. 
   We have seen the NAFTA model fail in Mexico. We have seen it fail in CAFTA countries. Why should we assume it will be any less disastrous in Peru or Panama? 
   We cannot fall for empty promises again. When we were told that NAFTA would result in a trade surplus, when we were told that NADBANC would help communities that were faced with job loss with reinvestment, when we were told NAFTA would be beneficial for Mexicans, Canadians, and the legislation passed this Congress, what did we see? Billions and billions of trade deficit dollars racked up. 
   We have never had a positive trade balance with the NAFTA countries or the CAFTA countries. We saw a washout of jobs in our middle-class communities, and we saw huge and growing protests across Mexico. It's a mistake to pass NAFTA, and it will be a mistake to extend it to other countries without comprehensive and effective reform. 
   This time Congress must be smarter. We must realize the administration is feeding us empty promises without enforceability and clear benefits. We should have no reason to be fooled again. 
   Even if we succeed with some changes to the core text of these agreements, do we trust President Bush to enforce them? We are still waiting for him to enforce the flagrant violations in the Jordanian agreement, where such language was included in the core of the trade agreement. 
   It is bad enough that his administration has the power to avoid any meaningful congressional amendment or any amendment at all. We cannot trust President Bush with fairly negotiating trade agreements, and we certainly cannot trust him to fairly enforce them. 
   If Congress passes these agreements with Peru and Panama, we only stand to perpetuate the race to the bottom cycle of lowered wages, reduced benefits worldwide, by taking these steps under the slippery slope of the Bush trade agreement that rewards Wall Street and its investors, but penalizes main streets across our Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TIME FOR AN OIL CHANGE -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, Friday, President Bush will visit Saudi Arabia to meet with King Abdullah and other key Saudi leaders. According to the White House, the President's visit will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the formal establishment of U.S.-Saudi relations. 
   Of course the underlying reason for the trip to Riyadh is to beg the Saudis to produce more oil. Faced with $4 a gallon gasoline--it was $3.99 this week in Ohio, and already exceeding over $4 in many parts of our country--a prospect which the President recently questioned would even happen, now the President is reduced to begging the Saudis, who literally have us over a barrel. 
   Record-high gasoline prices are hurting American families, American truckers and American businesses. The average price of gasoline has more than doubled since this President was placed in office. Fuel costs now account for 10 percent of the average family's budget. It is especially hard for people who have to drive to work, such as people in rural areas. It's hard for farmers and truckers who have seen diesel prices spiral way out of control. 
   And still we have no real leadership on a new energy policy from this White House, no policy for making our great Nation less dependent on undemocratic theocracies such as Saudi Arabia, and no policy to move away from the carbon-based economy and ease the pressure on our fragile planet. Under George W. Bush, America has gone backwards. 
   Last year, the United States imported 1.45 million barrels of crude oil from Saudi Arabia every single day of the year. Can you imagine that? 530 million barrels in 1 year. In fact, since this President has taken office, we, as a country, are importing a billion more barrels a year, a billion more barrels a year. Less independent, more dependent. 
   It just so happens America is the world's number one importer of crude and Saudi Arabia is the world's number one exporter. Fourteen percent of our Nation's oil addiction is supplied just by dealers in Saudi Arabia. That doesn't count Kuwait and all the surrounding countries, like Bahrain, et cetera. 
   Last year, we imported $237 billion worth of crude oil, one-third of a trillion dollars. That's when the average price per barrel was $64. This year, that number will probably top $300 billion, and rising.  
   For the first 3 months of this year, our crude oil imports totaled $76 billion, which is 63 percent above where it was a year ago. How much longer can this continue? I think the American people know how to answer that question: No more. They're saying no more. 
   This week, we will see another episode of this pitiful drama of the vice-grip relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States. The House of Bush, represented by our President, will beg the House of Saud, represented by King Abdullah, to increase production as a short-term fix for America's growing energy deficit. 
   We ought to be bringing those dollars back here at home and have the same kind of commitment as we did when we landed a man on the Moon. We can do this as a country, we just need better leadership. 
   At every step, this Democratic Congress has tried to make a difference. In the Price Gouging Prevention Act, the Renewable Energy Act, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Suspension Act, the Consumer Protection Act, and of course H.R. 6, to try to help launch energy independence for this country. But yesterday, our House passed a farm bill with a billion dollar title to bring in bioenergy as an important part of the solution for the future. 
   As this lame duck Presidency fades, hopefully the next President of the United States will negotiate in earnest and help America develop an agenda for our own independence, not continued subservience to human rights violators and undemocratic nations like Saudi Arabia. 
   This country is long overdue for a change, and it's definitely due for an oil change.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (U.S. TRADE DEFICIT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. trade deficit continues its relentless spiral upwards. More red ink. More outsourced jobs. More foreign imports. Nothing seems capable of slowing it down, neither the misguided Bush administration policy of forcing down the value of the dollar on global markets, nor a half-hearted, ineffective and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to increase U.S. exports. America wants results, not rhetoric. 
   According to recent reports, the current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of the trade deficit, reached $193 billion just in the first quarter of this year. Every year the red ink gets deeper. This represents 5.7 percent of our gross domestic product. It is a heavy ball and chain on the economic growth in our country, and it is becoming heavier. The trade deficit in goods in the first quarter surpassed $200 billion, and it dwarfed surpluses in services and income payments. 
   Although you won't hear it from the economists on the coasts, the gargantuan deficit in goods is a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy in parts of the country such as I represent. We need action in Washington to stop the loss of jobs due to the trade deficit hemorrhage and unfair foreign competition, including the remaining closed markets of the world in first world nations like Japan. 
   The trade deficit, Mr. Speaker, reveals two fundamental weaknesses in our national economic policy. First is our unforgivable utter dependence on imported petroleum, the primary category of trade deficit. American consumers end up paying twice for the government's failure to declare energy independence, first when they fill up, and second, when their own economy is undermined by the global oil giants working in tandem with the repressive kingdoms of the Middle East and other places. 
   One would think that our government would have heard the warnings long enough and often enough to take action against our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and I mean real action, like energy independence within a decade. 
   The President talked about it in his State of the Union speech, but he has not followed up with action. In fact, in his administration we are importing a billion more barrels of petroleum annually from other countries. So we should not be surprised, maybe, considering the President and Vice President are both oil men at heart. 
   The other weakness revealed by the current account deficit is our failure to  develop a trade policy that makes as its priority the competitiveness of American jobs and American businesses. The government, rather, has pursued a policy that sends manufacturing jobs overseas to third world places like China, which represents a growing share of this red ink. Talk to tool and dye makers in Ohio, those who somehow have survived. Talk to workers in the auto industry or the auto parts sector; they must wonder whether it is the official policy of the United States Government to throw them to the wolves. 
   Where, they ask, is the policy for making the United States economy competitive here at home in each of the categories where we have lost the edge? 
   Together, the trade deficit with China from petroleum and from automotive products account for 95 percent of the total, and somebody's got to pay. In order to finance the deficit, Americans are borrowing and selling assets to the tune of approximately $600 billion a year. Anything in your town been put on the chopping block yet? Debt service amounts to approximately $2,000 a year for every working American. We are truly indebted. 
   Sooner or later somebody has to pay that bill, and the American people know who that somebody is. The Chinese government alone holds enough foreign reserves to purchase about 5 percent of the shares of all publicly traded U.S. companies. The U.S. trade deficit is the main source of that Chinese wealth. Dr. Peter Morici of the University of Maryland has written about the impact of our trade policy on economic growth. He notes that every dollar spent on imports that is not matched by a dollar of exports reduces domestic demand here at home and employment and shifts workers into activities where productivity is lower. 
   Productivity is at least 50 percent higher in industries that export and compete with imports, and reducing the trade deficit and moving workers into these industries would increase our gross domestic product. If the administration and Congress showed the fortitude to cut the trade deficit, and we're not talking about a balanced trade account, just cutting the deficit by half, the gross domestic product would increase by an estimated $250 billion, or more than $1,700 for every working American. That comes to 1 percent a year due to this halving of the deficit rather than the loss of 1 percent of economic growth every year due to this continuing failed trade policy, which has been in place for at least two decades. 
   If we could just cut the deficit in half, workers wages could once again keep pace with inflation, families would no longer fall further behind with each passing month, and we would have better jobs, better paying wages and better benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately we will not see that economic growth until our government deals with this trade deficit and stops the hemorrhage. That would require political courage. I would sure like to see some of it here in this town. 
   U.S. Records $193 Billion First Quarter Current Account Deficit Taxing U.S. Growth  
   Today, the Commerce Department reported the first quarter current account deficit was $192.6 billion, up from $187.9 billion in the fourth quarter. 
   The deficit was 5.7 percent of GDP. The consensus forecast was $203 billion, and my published forecast was 195.8. 
   The current account is the broadest measure of the U.S. trade balance. In addition to trade in goods and services, it includes income received from U.S. investments abroad less payments to foreigners on their investments in the United States. 
   In the first quarter, the United States had a $24.1 billion surplus on trade in services and a $10.4 billion surplus on income payments. This was hardly enough to offset the massive $200.9 billion deficit on trade in goods. 
   The huge deficit on trade in goods is caused by a combination of an overvalued dollar against the Chinese yuan, a dysfunctional national energy policy that increases U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and the competitive woes of the three domestic automakers. Together, the trade deficit with China and on petroleum and automotive products account for about 95 percent of the deficit on trade in goods and services. 
   To finance the current account deficit, Americans are borrowing and selling assets at a pace of about $600 billion a year. U.S. foreign debt exceeds $6 trillion, and the debt service comes to about $2,000 a year for every working American. 
   A significant share of these funds was loaned to Americans by foreign governments. China and other governments loaned Americans more than 4.3 percent of GDP. 
   The current account deficit imposes a significant tax on GDP growth by moving workers from export and import-competing industries to other sectors of the economy. This reduces labor productivity, research and development (R&D) spending, and important investments in human capital. In 2007 the trade deficit is slicing about $250 billion off GDP, and longer term, it reduces potential annual GDP growth to 3 percent from 4 percent.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, America is embarking upon a Presidential election year. And what are these candidates offering? Some say hope. Others say change. Others say tax cuts. My fellow citizens, what we need for someone to say is we need action. 
   America is being bought out from under us. What do the candidates have to say about that? Nothing. Not yet. All the while, their campaign coffers are brimming with money, more and more, from Wall Street's hallowed givers and offshoring artists. 
   America, meanwhile, is falling deeper and deeper into recession with inflation rates the steepest in 17 years. All Wall Street wants to do is make more money. But at whose expense? These big bankers and fund managers will stop at nothing for profit, even at the price of our national security. They are selling out America. 
   Wall Street's thirst for profit drove the subprime lending crisis to suck the equity away from ordinary homebuyers. It has raided your pension funds. And the latest gimmick is grabbing for foreign money to bail themselves out from bad decisions that are covering staggering losses. 
   Citigroup, the largest institution in the country, has made headlines with its $10 billion fourth quarter losses. As a result, the bank is cutting thousands of jobs and turning to investors from where? China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Kuwait, to bail the company out. 
   An article I wish to place in the Record from the New York Times states, ``Other investors that are trying to pump money into Citigroup are Capital Research Global Investors.'' Well, who are they? Capital World Investors. I wonder who they are? It mentions the Kuwait Investment Authority, the New Jersey Division of Investment. New Jersey is going to bail out Citigroup? How can that be? Shareholder Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and former chief executive Sanford Weill and his family foundation. 
   The article goes on to say, ``Citigroup said it raised $12.5 billion in new cash from outside investors, including $6.88 billion from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation.'' 
   We're raising money from foreign governments to pump into U.S. banking institutions? Our entire financial sector is clawing at survival. 
   J.P. Morgan Chase lost 34 percent in the fourth quarter, with $1.3 billion in write-downs attributed to the subprime crisis. Will Tony Blair be able to bail them out in his new advisory position? To which foreign interest will he turn for cash? 
   Foreign capital indebts us more than the face value of the transaction. I thought we were a nation founded in independence. This kind of borrowing means America is no longer free. We owe and our children will owe, so will our grandchildren and our great grandchildren. And they won't owe Uncle Sam; they'll owe the Premier of Communist China, the King of Saudi Arabia, the Emir of the United Arab Emirates, the Bank of Singapore. 
   Wake up, America. George Washington said beware of entangling foreign alliances. He said, ``How many opportunities do such alliances afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils.'' 
   Wake up, America. 
   Well, these creditors won't forget what we owe. They like the influence they are wielding. They will call in their favors to Wall Street as they are calling in their favors as our troops are staged all over this globe. And to those candidates who were elected with Wall Street's help and their enormous financial support, they will call. 
   The problem is, the American people and the very principles to which this Republic is dedicated are compromised and eroded in the process. 
   Wake up, America. It's a time for action and for the people of this country to rise to preserve their diminishing independence. 
   Citigroup May Cut Thousands of Jobs 
   New York.--Citigroup Inc. is expected to announce thousands of job cuts after posting dismal results for the fourth quarter, when the bank's mortgage-riddled portfolio lost billions of dollars in value. 
   Citigroup swung to a loss of nearly $10 billion in the fourth quarter as it took a write down of $18.1 billion for bad bets related to the mortgage industry, the bank said on Tuesday. 
   On the hunt for cash, the nation's largest bank said Tuesday it also got a $12.5 billion investment from outside investors, including $6.88 billion from the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. 
   Other investors were Capital Research Global Investors, Capital World Investors, the Kuwait Investment Authority, the New Jersey Division of Investment, shareholder Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and former chief executive Sanford Weill and his family foundation. 
   Citigroup also took a net charge of $3.31 billion for loan-loss reserves in its U.S. consumer credit business--primarily for delinquencies on mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. A year earlier it reversed $127 million in loan-loss reserves. Citi cited increasing signs of weakness among the consumer--something many others have pointed to as a potential indicator of a recession. 
   Fourth-quarter losses totaled $9.83 billion, or $1.99 per share, compared with earnings of $5.13 billion, or $1.03 per share, during the same quarter in 2006. Citigroup's revenue fell to $7.22 billion in the fourth quarter, down 70 percent from $23.83 billion generated during the final quarter of 2006. 
   Analysts polled by Thomson Financial, on average, forecast a loss of $1.03 per share for the quarter on revenue of $10.64 billion. The biggest loss estimate for the quarter was for a loss of $1.43 per share, while the lowest revenue estimate was for $6.47 billion. 
   Citigroup was hit hard for the second straight quarter by rising delinquencies and defaults in the mortgage market--especially among subprime loans given to customers with poor credit history. The New York-based bank cut the value of bonds and debt backed by the troubled loans by $18.1 billion. During the third quarter, Citigroup took about $6 billion in write-downs. 
   It was not all bad news for Citigroup, though, as the bank recorded record results in its international consumer, transaction services and wealth management segments. 
   International consumer revenue increased 45 percent, due to a 21 percent year-over-year increase in average deposits and a 30 percent jump in loan volume. Citigroup's international consumer unit also benefited from a $507 million pretax gain on Visa Inc. shares and a $313 million gain on the sale of Nikko Cordial's Simplex Investment Advisors. 
   Transaction services revenue increased to a record $2.29 billion, driven by growing customer volume.  
   For the full year, Citigroup posted net income of $3.62 billion, or 72 cents per share. 
   As part of a plan to boost capital on its balance sheet after the fourth-quarter losses, Citigroup said it raised $12.5 billion in new cash from outside investors, including $6.88 billion from the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. 
   Citigroup also cut its quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share from 54 cents per share to save money. 
   Shares of Citigroup fell 85 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $28.21 in premarket trading from a $29.06 close Monday.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) and also Congressman Kendrick Meek from Florida, two 30-somethings who are outstanding leaders in this Congress, bringing new energy and new vision. I thank them for yielding me this time. 
   We will have extensive debates on the budget concerning the supplemental request for the war in Iraq, the global war on terrorism, and other related measures tomorrow and later next week. But as we are debating this and looking at sending another $100 billion across the oceans, halfway around the world, to support our troops and to try to reach resolution to that conflict, I want to bring to the attention of the American people a very serious issue here at home, one that is making headlines all over the United States. 
   This is USA Today's headline, ``Record Foreclosures Reel Lenders,'' and ``Subprime Troubles Send Stocks Into Swoon.'' 
   The issue of mortgages across this country going belly up by the thousands should be of concern to every Member of this Congress. The stock market this week has been roiled by concerns over the financial health of largely unregulated mortgage brokerage institutions that have been irresponsibly issuing mortgages in what is called the subprime market across this country and much of that market targets consumers with less than stellar credit ratings or who are at the margins of home ownership in this country. 
   They have been luring them into mortgages they can't afford, and as those mortgages adjust to higher interest rates in the third, fourth, fifth and subsequent years, they go belly up. 
   We saw yesterday the connection between the fast rate of foreclosures and the health of our economy when the Dow dropped 243 points as a reaction to the dramatic rise in these foreclosures. As USA Today recounts in the first paragraph, ``The reason many mortgage lenders are in trouble became alarmingly clear Tuesday. The Mortgage Bankers Association said more than 2.1 million Americans with a home loan missed at least one payment at the end of last year, and the rate of new foreclosures hit a record.'' 
   Companies like New Century Financial, the Nation's second largest subprime lender, have quit making loans and are edging towards bankruptcy protection. There is a map in the article that shows certain States, and I am going to discuss my own now, that are far above the national average where we know thousands upon thousands of people are losing their homes. 
   Ohio was the number one State in the Union to date with these mortgage foreclosures, three times the national average. They are estimating that in the next year and a half, over 250,000 more home mortgages will reset, and they are estimating that the financing gap in Ohio for this year and next year now totals somewhere between $14 billion and $21 billion. That is just Ohio. Add to it Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, 
   Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia. This is a problem of national proportion. 
   There is plenty of blame to go around, but there is no question it is a serious issue that should be given primacy in this Congress. 
   I want to compliment the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) for holding hearings yesterday on hedge funds, the unregulated part of the financial markets that is rather secretive. We don't know a lot about them, but we know many times they are involved with intertwining with these types of loans that have been going out into the marketplace. 
   We know our weak economy contributes to the situation, but also the failure of the past Congress as well as State legislatures to address predatory lending practices and to try to nip this problem in the bud before it became so much worse. 
   There is another side to this coin as well, and that is the large number of campaign contributions made by these hot-shot lending brokerage firms that have been making deals across this country; and that story, unfortunately, has to come out, too, and perhaps why some lawmakers have been unwilling to grapple with the magnitude of this problem and prevent the kind of foreclosures that are going on across the country. 
   Let me say that this USA Today article and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have a phone number that I urge citizens to call: 888-995-HOPE. 888-995-HOPE. 
   This line will connect those who are concerned about losing their homes to foreclosure with foreclosure prevention counselors nationwide. That is something we can do immediately. In the measure we will pass next week, we will make every effort possible to put in housing counseling money, and I would urge the Department of Housing and Urban Development to target those dollars to the areas that are just bleeding with foreclosure after foreclosure after foreclosure. 
   State and local governments could do a lot to help homeowners find help also, particularly in working out financing deals. I think Wall Street is going to have to take some losses. They ought to take them earlier rather than later. We ought to package some of this debt, and we ought to find a way to eat some of it and move some of those egregious profits they are making into filling the financing gap, because what good will it do for us to have millions of housing units across this country vacant? It is not going to help anybody. 
   We know in these subprime markets, they don't set aside escrow money for property taxes, and we know this is going to have a major effect on local government as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say the President and his administration are focused on rebuilding Iraq, but somebody had better focus on rebuilding America and dealing with these rising foreclosure problems across the country. I will be the first in this Congress to put my shoulder to the wheel. 
   I want to thank Congressman Meek for yielding me this time and thank him for his leadership in showing how much money we are spending in Iraq and how it is affecting our ability to address domestic needs here that coast to coast are so very serious.   
   Subprime Troubles Send Stocks Into Swoon 
   depth of damage in mortgage business concerns investors 
   The ripple effect of the ``submerging'' subprime mortgage market hit Wall Street hard Tuesday, with the Dow suffering a 243-point drop amid growing fears that home loan woes will infect other companies and hurt the broader U.S. economy. In another volatile day on Wall Street, stocks were battered by a slew of negative news in the home loan arena, prompting investors to wonder just how deep the damage in the mortgage business will turn out to be. 
   ``The market fears that the submerging subprime lenders could drag down other companies with it,'' says Sam Stovall, chief strategist at Standard & Poor's. ``Investors fear credit will dry up,'' which will make it harder for people to borrow money to buy homes and for companies to raise much-needed cash in a pinch. 
   Tuesday's biggest losers were financial companies that either lend money directly to homeowners or provide cash to the lenders themselves. Shares of subprime and commercial lenders, investment banks and brokers all finished deep in the red. The top two decliners in the Dow Jones industrial average, for example, were American Express, down 3.5%, and JPMorgan Chase, down 4.4%. 
   Pain in that sector is magnified by the fact that financial services is the biggest of the 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, accounting for almost 22% of the index's total market value. 
   Still, the fallout was broad-based. The Dow fell 243 points, or 2.0%, to 12,076, its worst drop since Feb. 27, when it plunged 416 points. The S&P also dropped 2%, with 487 of its 500 components finishing lower. The three worst S&P industry groups were home building, specialized finance and investment banks/brokerages. 
   The bad news in mortgage land continued to pile up around subprime lenders as New Century Financial shares lost 49% and Accredited Home Lenders fell 65% on concerns their financial woes will worsen. The S&P's worst-performing stock: Bear Stearns, a big Wall Street brokerage with subprime exposure, fell 6.7%. 
   The big question now is whether Tuesday's sell-off, like the Feb. 27 plunge, is just air being let out of the speculative balloon, or whether more serious economic issues are at play, says Nicholas Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors. ``Yeah, we are going to see a general tightening of credit standards and a crackdown on subprime lenders,'' Sargen says. ``If you say it stops there, that is nothing new. But, and it's a big but, nobody knows for sure.''  
   Investors will be watching what Lehman Bros. says about the health of the mortgage market and if the damage is isolated to subprime lenders when it reports earnings Thursday. Says S&P's Howard Silverblatt: ``They will be looking to get more info as to how much exposure there is and who else is exposed.''  
   Record Foreclosures Reel Lenders  
   The reason many mortgage lenders are in trouble became alarmingly clear Tuesday. The Mortgage Bankers Association said more than 2.1 million Americans with a home loan missed at least one payment at the end of last year--and the rate of new foreclosures hit a record. 
   The problem is most severe for borrowers with scuffed credit and adjustable-rate mortgages. More than 14% of them were behind on their payments. And the worst is yet to come, the MBA said. At least $300 billion in subprime ARMs will reset this year to higher interest rates. Those borrowers face higher payments and a harder time refinancing. 
   Blindsided by the number of loans that have already gone bad, more than two dozen lenders have gone out of business or been purchased. New Century Financial, the nation's second-largest subprime lender, has quit making loans and is edging toward bankruptcy protection. 
   ``There's been a stunning erosion of mortgage quality,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. ``It's primarily in the subprime market, but the entire market is weakening ..... and that adds to problems in the housing market, and by extension the broader economy.'' Retailers are already feeling the effect, he said, because homeowners tend to spend less when they fear their homes are worth less. 
   To stem their losses, lenders are ending 100% financing plans, requiring better credit scores and demanding more proof of a borrower's income. The stricter rules are squeezing first-time buyers, as well as homeowners who want to refinance. 
   Sellers, meantime, must compete with a rising number of foreclosures at cut-rate prices. Lenders that seize control of a house are usually aggressive about selling it, to limit the cost of maintaining and marketing it. 
   It's like a one-two punch, Zandi says. ``It means less demand because many potential borrowers will be locked out,'' just as foreclosures expand the supply of homes for sale. 
   Some economists, such as Patrick Newport of Global Insight, had been expecting the real estate market to rebound soon. Now, he says, ``We probably won't see a recovery in the housing market until next year.'' 
   In fact, sales of new homes are expected to fall 10% this year, while sales of existing homes are likely to slip about 1%, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. 
   States with the most job losses are seeing the largest number of delinquencies. In Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, Michigan, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee, at least one in five subprime ARMs is in default. 
   In the final quarter of last year, 0.54% of homeowners with a mortgage began foreclosure proceedings--a record--up from 0.46% in the third quarter. 
   Calls from distressed homeowners to the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, a free credit counseling service (888-995-HOPE or 888-995-4673), have more than doubled from last summer.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FINANCIAL MARKETS TODAY -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the gentlelady from California, our dear colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, and thank her very much for her remarks on Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. We share your feelings and your warmth and affection toward her, and I know that your remarks are of comfort to her son, to her sister, to her family, to all those who are associated with her and, of course, her staff, who must carry on. We thank you so much for that. 
   I rise this evening to do my part to offer the American people a point of view about the financial markets today and their unsteadiness. We know that the Dow Jones dropped over 500 points. We can all question how Wall Street and its actions have placed our country in this position with such high risk, high-leverage practices with no accountability. 
   I can remember back to 1999 when some of us fought very hard against the Securities Reform Act, so called, of that year, when, for the first time since 1935, this Congress passed the turning back of the Glass-Spiegel Act, threw it out the window, actually, where in our country we separated banking from commerce. We said, no, all those years, prior to 1999, we didn't want to be like the European banks, we thought it was very risky to allow Wall Street to undertake some of these practices that have now led to this great instability. 
   Many citizens are calling our office, and people bump into you and say, well, what are we supposed to do? We are concerned about the future? I guess one word would be, one phrase would be, don't panic. 
   Short-term advice to families would be to take a look at, if you have savings, where they are deposited, make sure they are in accounts that are federally insured by the Federal Deposit Corporation. This Congress will do whatever it must to make sure that those accounts are insured up to a level of $100,000, which is the current law. People can look at their bank accounts, they can look at their credit-union accounts and make sure that they are within those boundaries. 
   People can take a look at safe investments like U.S. Treasury bills, and U.S. Savings Bonds. Yes, they don't pay as much. Sometimes their maturity periods are much longer, but people have to be thinking about the long term, not just the short-term. Sometimes, I guess there is an old expression, sometimes when something looks so good, it's too good to be true, it probably isn't true. So one ought to be very prudent in these times. 
   Of course, having a hard asset like a home or a piece of land, or something that is very tangible and can hold value in the future, is something to think about in order to protect yourself for the future in view of some of what we are experiencing. 
   I would advise families to avoid pay-day loans to make sure they don't lock themselves into these never-ending loans with interest rates that push you into the poorhouse so fast you can hardly believe it. 
   I would encourage citizens to avoid high risk. Again, if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. What has happened as a result of all this so-called banking deregulation, there are a lot of mailings that go out to people asking them to get hooked on credit, and they don't tell people how much that interest rate is going to be down the road. 
   There are many, many phone calls that come into families' homes now from places far away, where there is no accountability. You don't really know who the people are. You can't even see who is talking to you over the telephone. 
   I would urge families to be very, very cautious and to get good sound financial advice. Look locally to one of your certified, not-for-profit consumer counseling agencies. There is a network of those around the country. You can call your Member of Congress in your own region, and you can find out who the certified not-for-profit counselor is in your area. 
   Many times credit unions, even if you are not a member of the credit union, they do great. Consumer counseling, that's what they are established for under the laws of our country, and you can really try to protect yourself in the markets that we are facing today. It's a little bit dicey out there, so you have to be careful. 
   Congress, again, must meet its responsibilities to protect the deposits of the American people. We certainly will do whatever is necessary there. But people can do a lot for themselves as well. 
   I always tell people if you can't afford a fancy car, get one for transportation. Why do you have to prove to somebody that you can buy the most expensive car in the world? You don't really need that if you are lucky to have a job in the economy of today. 
   If you can't afford the gasoline, use the bus system. Use the bus maybe 2 days a week, drive 3 days a week. Find a way to use the dollars you have wisely. Think creatively. 
   Communities, and I know our mayors are struggling with this around the country, how do they really hedge against an uncertain future? My advice is to make decisions and think about how do we use the dollars in this community wisely, to create wealth, and wealth is more than money, wealth, our assets that grow over time. 
   Money sometimes is fungible. It can disappear off a balance sheet. But, in fact, if you have a set of farmers around your community, who can help your region become more financially and food self-sufficient, communities ought to exercise that power. 
   We ought to help our citizens become energy self-sufficient in their own households. There are many things communities can do. 
   As I close this evening, I would urge communities across this country to think about creating wealth, not just pushing money around, and getting the best financial advice you possibly can in these difficult times.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN SEIBERLING -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Congressman Ryan, I just want to thank you for your leadership in assembling this Special Order this evening. Every member of the delegation joins you in extending our deepest sympathy to Betty, to John's family, to all of his friends, not just in Akron but across this country. I know how proud he would be of you and of your service to have this very intelligent force here inside the Congress. 
   I had the great joy of serving with John Seiberling. One can offer many plaudits and memories of his great work, and I am flooded with memories as I speak this evening, but one word comes to mind. That word is ``integrity.'' John Seiberling was absolutely an honest, decent, patriotic American. I recall many of his great works. I think he had these beige Chuck-A Boots, these Chuck-A Boots. Do you remember when those were in style? He always wore them. You knew when John had the Chuck-A Boots on that he'd either been up in Alaska or that he'd just come back from trying to get the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area designated or that he'd been out west in some park or on some mountain somewhere. He always had like a tweed jacket, and he had a cut about him where you knew that he had been raised in a family of wealth. He didn't spend a lot of money on clothes, but he dressed a certain way. There was a certain cut of the man that helped to define him, and when he looked at you, he looked at you straight, and you always knew where John Seiberling stood. There was a certain way he held himself. It was as though he held up the honor of the office by the way he held his spine. 
   I remember the day that Betty sat in the gallery when those of us who were here honored his legacy and his last day of service here in the Congress. I can't believe it was that many years ago, because he was such a force here within the Congress, itself, such a force for integrity of the institution. In fact, in my office, I have a plaque that I had made because of a plaque he had hung in his office, which said that this office belongs to the people of his congressional district in Ohio. I was so impressed that, outside my office, I had a sign made: ``This office belongs to the people of the 9th Congressional District.'' John Seiberling always held us to a higher standard. 
   I have to tell you that I had an experience. When I was first elected, there were only two eagles left on Lake Erie, which is in the western part of Ohio, the region that I represent, and John had just started on the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area. This past year, something really wonderful happened. We've increased the number of eagles to 12 times what used to exist. We have 144 nesting pairs now, but a year and a half ago, two of those critters flew over to the Cuyahoga National Recreation Area, and they took nest, and they've now had three baby eaglets. Every time I think of that, I say, ``Thank you, John Seiberling, for what you did,'' as we give rebirth to this region of America. 
   When he grew up, the Cuyahoga River became a national disgrace as it burned, and people still remember that image today, but John knew it had to be healed. He began doing just what Congressman Ryan and what Congresswoman Sutton have said, working here in the House and, of course, with our dear friend Congressman Ralph Regula as well, to put into place these green emeralds, these jewels of parklands that have now been placed, expanded and improved to a point where our western basin of Lake Erie can touch the eastern side of Ohio in a way that helps to raise up the symbol of this country, the bald eagle. 
   If it would be all right with the gentleman, I have remarks I would like to place in the Record.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN SEIBERLING -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I don't know if it was noted that John was born in 1918, in this month of September, to Lieutenant John Frederick Seiberling and Henrietta McBrayer Buckler. Like his father, John went on to serve his country in the Armed Forces. While fighting in World War II while in the United States Army, he was awarded the Legion of Merit in the recognition of his role in planning motor transport for the D-day invasion of Normandy. 
   When you think back to what he did as a young man and from his military service on, he never stopped fighting for his country. He was such a patriot. Congressman Ryan talked about his ivy league education and his roots, his scion from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. He could have come here, and he could have represented Wall Street, but John Seiberling never did that. He represented the best interests of this country. He never tried to clean up for himself. I remember, after he retired, he sent me this beautiful, beautiful book about flowers in the Akron area and about the ecosystem of the northeastern part of Ohio. He was always teaching; he was always contributing, and he made this institution sparkle. 
   Now, was he a telegenic figure? We seem to be in an age of television and media where everybody has got to have the right makeup and the right glasses. Are you telegenic? Are you TV ready? Are you camera ready? You know, John Seiberling didn't care about that. Sometimes his tweed suit would be a little bit rumpled. I wish for more Members with rumpled suits whose hair isn't exactly combed. John was always very neat--don't get me wrong--but he was there for the country, and he trudged it from coast to coast. 
   I think that his service on the House Judiciary Committee, history will note, took great courage as he 
   drafted the Articles of Impeachment brought against former President Richard Nixon. Imagine the courage and the scholarship and the acumen that that effort entailed. He was a man to be dealt with, and you knew exactly where he stood, and when he was in your corner, he never wavered. 
   I wanted to mention his devotion to his family, to Betty. They were a team. I remember one time, Congressman Ryan, when for whatever reason I ended up in Akron, Ohio, at this big event in the city. I walked in this room, and I was meeting buckeyes whom I'd never met before. All of a sudden, there came this man down the aisle, to be seated with his wife. He had retired from Congress, and his vision wasn't that good at that point. They brought John Seiberling in, and the audience just applauded wall to wall until he took his seat with his wife's next to his. He was present for the program, and he heard every word. His mind was quick, and he absorbed everything that happened. When I went up to him afterwards, he knew exactly who I was; he knew exactly what had happened, and he was there to try to change America for the better in that particular election year.  
   To their sons John, David and Stephen, all I will say is thank you from the Kaptur family for allowing us to know your father because, to this day, he has an influence inside this institution. I learned so much from him, and he was so kind to me as a new Member and as the first woman from my region of Ohio ever to be elected here. He welcomed me. He helped to tutor me. He made me feel very much a part of this institution from day one. I shall always be grateful to him. I never forget him. He is a standard that I hold and is someone to whom I still look up in my own work. As I look at that plaque every day, I think of him. I can't tell you how many people have commented on it, and I always say, ``That's from Congressman Seiberling.'' His life still resonates here and across our country. We loved him, too. 
   Now, he wasn't exactly a lovable figure in a way. There was a certain circumstance about him. I suppose, because of his lawyerly training, you sort of felt like you were meeting a judge in a way and that he was judging every person and every event at which he was present, but there was also a great strength, and you wanted to know him better. You wanted him to teach you. You wanted to learn from him. The country is better served by individuals like him. 
   I doubt that John took millions of dollars away from here in any way, personally or politically. He wasn't that kind of guy. He served our country. Oh, we would be so much better if we could have more John Seiberlings in this institution. 
   So I say to Congressman Ryan thank you so much. You know in whose footsteps you walk. Congresswoman Sutton knows in whose footsteps she walks. 
   I just feel very fortunate to have been able to serve here long enough to have known John Seiberling. His perseverance, I think, has inspired us all. 
   I would say to the gentleman I have other remarks to make, but I'm sure that you have other material there that you would like to place in the Record. I just know John is watching over us and is wanting us to do better, to do better for the Republic because he did better for the Republic, and we hope to make him proud.

   Ms. KAPTUR. You know what is really interesting Congressman Ryan, is that coming from the background that he did, he could have been an unceasing voice for business as usual. But John took that background and he grew from it and he became something beyond his own heritage in a way, and he wanted to make America a better place. 
   Having seen some of what happened in industry run amuck, he believed in industry, but he knew it could be done in a better way and he set a different path for America. And his family has every right to feel blessed and gratified, as we do, for having known him. And Ohioans and every American really has a right to consider themselves very, very fortunate for having had a man like John Seiberling in our lives, if only for a time. 
   And I know that his family will miss him deeply. We certainly have missed him from the day that he left here, and we hope that the strength that he gave to all of us and to his family in life will comfort them now. 
   And we know that John Seiberling made his mark, and we feel very fortunate to have counted him among our most beloved colleagues.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend our able colleague, Congressman ZACK SPACE of Ohio for recognition of our beloved former Ohio Senator John Glenn, who began his distinguished career as a World War II and Korean War fighter pilot. Glenn was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and holds the Air Medal for his service during both of these conflicts. 
   As the beginning in a long line of firsts, Senator and Colonel Glenn went on to set a transcontinental speed record from Los Angeles to New York in July 1957. In February 1962, Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. After his distinguished service in these two wars and following the first phase of his career as an aviator, John Glenn continued his public service as a Senator representing our home State of Ohio from 1974-1999. 
   Completing his career of firsts, I was proud to see our former colleague Senator Glenn bring his career of public service full circle in his triumphant 1998 return space voyage; this time as a senior citizen. Today I rise to honor his hard work and lifetime of dedication to public service. He and his devoted wife have inspired all the world with their commitment to family, community, state, nation and the future. Their spirit of patriotism, courage, discovery and self sacrifice cut a path all can emulate and hope to achieve. Godspeed to them for all they have done for others.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tonight the President of the United States says he will veto funding for our troops, for veterans health care, and even for victims of Hurricane Katrina. He still refuses to work with Congress to do what is necessary to resolve the quagmire in Iraq, and to win the hearts and minds of people across the Arab and Islamic world. 
   His policies are breeding terrorism. His policies are forcing higher gasoline prices in our country. His policies are forcing the import of a billion more barrels of petroleum every year into our country from the most undemocratic regimes in the world, and his foreign policies are a total failure. 
   Meanwhile, here at home, our economy seems to be moving in opposite directions at the same time. On Wall Street, things have never been better. The stock market has record to all time records. Last week the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 13,000 points for the first time in history. The Standard & Poors index has climbed at an annualized rate of 13 to 14 percent for the first four months of this year. Everything's coming up roses for the investment class. 
   But it's a different story on Main Street. Yes, it's a different story in the real world, where our constituents see gasoline prices just challenged the $3 a gallon mark again. 
   The stock market might be soaring, but consumer sentiment is in the dumper. The Conference Board reported last week that consumers confidence fell to its lowest level since last August. 
   Economic growth has slowed. The Gross Domestic Product, we learned last Friday, increased at a weak 1.3 percent annual rate for the first quarter of this year. 
   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange might be irrationally exuberant, but families in the Midwest are increasingly worried. Chances are, they won't make ends meet this time with a home equity loan. 
   The National Association of Realtors reported today that sales of existing homes fell unexpectedly in March to their lowest level in 4 years. New construction down sharply in the first quarter of this year, and late payments on subprime mortgages increased by 35 percent in the first quarter of this year. 
   The foreclosure crisis that has hit Ohio and Michigan very hard threatens to spread to other parts of our economy. So much is clear, the housing bubble has burst. 
   Paul Krugman, the economist and New York Times columnist wrote about this ``economic disconnect'' between Wall Street and Main Street in yesterday's edition. He started by quoting Edward Lazear, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisor who says what's good for corporations is good for America.     
   And workers will benefit from this growth in productivity. The problem with that is it's not true. High profits haven't led to high investment. Rising productivity hasn't led to high wages. And I might add free trade agreements haven't led to free trade. 
   Even the investment banking company, Morgan Stanley, unwittingly acknowledged this brutal fact. In a recent newsletter, Joseph McAlinden, their chief global strategist, bragged with a laughable chart that wages have soared 4 percent at an annual rate. Well, when wages soar at 4 percent, barely keeping pace with inflation, what happens when you discount for prices? I doubt that if stocks were soaring by 4 percent that he would say it is a great thing. I guess it all depends on your perspective. Median workers' earnings adjusted for inflation have been static since this President took office, and the economy feels anything but great to most Americans. They would say, ``Show me the money.'' The fact is, on Main Street, wages have barely kept pace with inflation, and workers, if they are lucky enough to hold on to their benefits, have to pay increasingly larger costs for them. Meanwhile, corporate profits have more than doubled since 2000. And according to Krugman, corporate profits as a share of national income reached their highest levels in American history last year. 
   That is what happens when productivity increases while wages remain static. Corporate profits soar and stock prices follow but not workers' wages. Wall Street reaches record heights because companies are turning around and reinvesting those profits not in new machinery and jobs, but in making more money on our outsourced jobs. 
   It is time that Main Street holds Wall Street accountable.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PETRODOLLARS AND THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Wall Street Journal reported last week what most Americans may not realize, that for the first time in history, our U.S. military is now guarding the major Iraqi oil pipeline that leads to its major refinery in Bayji. Yes, our brave soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are now maintaining around-the-clock presence at Iraq's largest oil pipeline and refinery to fight the corruption, smuggling and sabotage that characterize Iraq's oil industry, its premier industry. 
   The article talks about the flourishing market in stolen Iraqi oil. It says U.S. military officials estimate that as much as 70 percent of the fuel processed at the plant is lost to the black market, an amount valued at more than $2 billion. Iraq's oil reserves may be the largest in the world. Future access to them is now being determined by a group of people we generally don't see on the evening news. 
   Do you know them? It's important to figure out who those people are and who exactly is now involved in writing Iraq's hydrocarbon law. How transparent are these oil deliberations? 
   Indeed, it is amazing how little we hear about them, as trillions of dollars are at stake. Meanwhile, oil smuggling has earned lots of shady characters hundreds of millions of dollars since the beginning of the war. Why did we let this go on? Until now, we can catch Saddam Hussein in the spider hole, and yet somehow we could not figure out who is smuggling Iraqi oil? 
   Americans deserve answers to so many questions. Who has been earning the money from the oil smuggling? Which global oil companies will benefit once the U.S. leaves Iraq? What percent of oil resources in Iraq will be left for the Iraqi people? 
   Traveling to Iraq and Kuwait a few weeks ago, I had the chance to witness how technology and power systems transformed endless deserts into oil supply lines. It is an awesome sight. Yet I couldn't help but ask, what is America doing in these deserts? Who does our oil addiction benefit? How have we let ourselves become tied to oil dictatorships? Why do we pay nearly $400 billion a year to import petroleum rather than become energy-independent ourselves here at home? 
   Our able colleague, Congressman Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts, gave me a book last week, and I looked on page 96. This is called ``The Price of Loyalty,'' by Ron Suskind. It explains how Donald Rumsfeld used our Defense Intelligence Agency to map Iraq's oil fields and lists companies that might be interested in leveraging the precious asset long before the Iraqi war was declared. 
   Judicial Watch obtained Mr. Rumsfeld's map through a Freedom of Information request because Mr. Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz would not share it voluntarily. Imagine that. Our taxpayers footed the bill for this map to benefit private firms. 
   The book attests Rumsfeld and his cohorts in the Bush administration were not concerned with legitimate reasons to go to war; they only concerned themselves with how and how quickly to penetrate Iraq's oil fields. Mr. Wolfowitz had written as early as 1999 that the United States should be committed, should be prepared to commit ground forces to protect a sanctuary in southern Iraq where the opposition could safely mobilize. As we pay dearly for this violent war, and our soldiers die in Iraq, just coincidentally we have to remember the world's largest untapped oil reserves are in Iraq. 
   Most other nations in the Middle East have guarded their oil reserves as national treasures, but I will tell you what: Halliburton, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, ChevronTexaco and foreign companies like Total, Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum have been identified by reporters like Antonia Juhasz, who said last week in the New York Times, these oil companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies, hire Iraqi workers or share their new technologies. In fact, she says, only 13 of the 80 oil wells, oil fields in Iraq would be for the Iraqi people. The other ones are being bargained away as the hydrocarbon law is written. Why do we hear so little about this on our evening news? 
   John Perkins, in his book ``Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,'' talks about how Saudi oil money through petrodollars has been reinvested in our economy, holding up so many of our equities and certainly our U.S. Treasury securities. Why can't America become energy-independent at home? Why do we have to be dependent to the 20th century view of dependency on foreign oil?  
   ``Almost immediately after the [1973 oil] embargo ended,'' Perkins writes, ``Washington began negotiating with the Saudis, offering them technical support, military hardware and training and an opportunity to bring their nation into the twentieth century, in exchange for petrodollars and, most importantly, assurances that there would never be another oil embargo.'' Congress did not negotiate this--the overall management and fiscal responsibility lay with the Department of the Treasury, and according to the book, the ensuing agreement, which was negotiated in intense secrecy, ``fortif[ied] the concept of mutual interdependence.'' The very goal of this agreement was to ``find ways that would assure that a large portion of petrodollars found their way back to the United States'' so that ``Saudi Arabia would be  drawn in, its economy would become increasingly intertwined with and dependent upon ours'' and, of course, we on them. It is a ridden economy. 
   Is this the America you want? Do you want U.S. soldiers risking their lives guarding Iraqi oil? I want an America free of counterproductive foreign entanglements. I want an America free of support for dictatorships, no matter how tempting their treasures. I want an America free of foreign oil. I want to invest our dollars here at home in energy independence--in solar, wind, hydrogen, clean coal, new turbine systems, fuel cells and so much more. 
   I think most Americans, if they understood the extent to which we are hurting ourselves, would want the same. Some global interests are getting so filthy rich year after year, that they would risk a free America for the sake of their bloodied oil profits. It's worth changing how we do business in order to regain our freedom.   
   Iraq's Oil Smugglers Are Targeted  
   BAYJI, IRAQ--Adding another facet to Washington's new pacification plan for Iraq, U.S. and Iraqi forces have launched an aggressive campaign to curb the oil smuggling that is destabilizing the fragile Baghdad government and helping to fund insurgents. 
   In concert with stepped-up military and reconstruction initiatives across Iraq, U.S. troops for the first time are maintaining a round-the-clock presence at the sprawling oil refinery here, Iraq's largest. Soldiers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division are cracking down on illegal gas stations, arresting refinery workers suspected of corruption and using sophisticated data-sifting methods to identify which senior Iraqi officials might have ties to black-market oil rings. 
   The Iraqi government, meanwhile, has begun what it calls Operation Honest Hands, which puts the entire refinery under Iraqi military control. Iraqi Army soldiers are physically monitoring each of the facility's pumps and entrances, assuming many of the responsibilities previously held by a paramilitary security force employed by the Oil Ministry that was widely considered corrupt and ineffectual. Iraqi troops are also escorting many convoys of fuel trucks from the refinery to destinations around the country. 
   The move represents another course change for the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush as it struggles to craft a new approach for stabilizing Iraq. U.S. and Iraqi officials have long been aware of the flourishing market in stolen Iraqi oil but largely turned a blind eye because Washington feared that stationing American soldiers in major refineries would spark a nationalist backlash and renew accusations that the U.S. invaded Iraq for its oil. The Iraqi government, meanwhile, felt its modest security resources were better used directly fighting insurgents. 
   But officials from both governments have concluded recently that oil smuggling had become too big a problem to ignore any longer. The loss of so much output to the black market is sharply reducing the Iraqi government's main source of revenue: About 94% of Iraq's $32 billion budget last year came from oil revenue. The stolen oil also gives Iraq's insurgent groups a ready source of income, helping to perpetuate the country's civil war. 
   ``Disrupting the insurgent funding is our main job,'' said 30-year-old Capt. Kwenton Kuhlman, who is leading the antismuggling operation at the Bayji refinery. ``I'm under no illusions--we can't stop it. It's too big. But we can try to disrupt it.'' 
   Iraq produces some 2 million barrels of oil a day, but U.S. and Iraqi officials believe the figure could rise as high as 5 million barrels a day with improved security and new infrastructure. 
   Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein helped create the black market in oil in response to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. Mr. Hussein used smuggling, as well as kickbacks on oil sold legitimately through the United Nations' oil-for-food program, to generate cash for his regime and to reward allies at home and abroad. 
   The stepped-up fight against smuggling has no guarantee of success--and risks triggering more political and economic turmoil. Senior Iraqi officials regularly pressure the Americans to call off specific investigations or release individuals detained for suspected involvement in the black market, feeding Washington's suspicions that oil-related corruption extends deep into the government. 
   The enormity of the task facing the soldiers from the 82nd Airborne was evident on recent visits, and underscores the broader challenge Americans face in turning more security over to their Iraqi counterparts. Several tanker drivers said Iraqi soldiers at the plant had already begun asking for bribes. The drivers also said they don't want to be escorted by Iraqi troops for fear of attracting insurgent attacks. ``I want coalition forces to guard this place, not the Iraqi Army,'' driver Suhaib Adil Kareem said. ``The Iraqis don't care about the law.'' 
   Widespread oil smuggling siphons off as much as $5 billion per year. At the Bayji refinery--one of three in the country [U.S. military officials estimate that as much as 70% of the fuel processed at the plant is lost to the black market, an amount valued at more than $2 billion per year.] 
   Iraq's parliament will soon debate a landmark petroleum law that would clear the way for direct foreign investment in the battered oil sector and set out rough guidelines for distributing oil revenue among Iraq's 18 provinces. But U.S. and Iraqi officials warn the new law will have little substantive impact unless the smuggling is brought under control. 
   The endemic oil-sector corruption is a financial boon to insurgent operations. A classified U.S. government report in November estimated Iraqi militants earn $25 million to $100 million every year by stealing tankers full of fuel, smuggling oil to other countries, carrying out kidnappings for ransom, and charging protection money from truckers and gas station owners. 
   ``The fuel that is stolen comes back as bombs, mortar shells and Katyusha rockets,'' said Hamad Hamoud al-Shakti, the governor of the Salahaddin province, home to the Bayji refinery. 
   The black market is fueled by three factors. Baghdad heavily subsidizes gasoline and other oil products, and the resulting low prices mean they can be resold at enormous profit in neighboring countries. The government also doesn't verify that gas-station owners--who are entitled to receive 100,000 liters of fuel per week--sell to retail customers instead of on the black market. 
   The biggest issue, though, is pervasive corruption. U.S. and Iraqi officials say refinery workers routinely allow tankers to pick up fuel without any paperwork, which makes it easy to sell off the books. Police officers demand bribes of as much as $1,000 to let tankers pass through checkpoints or for ``protection'' along routes, the officials say. And some government officials work directly with smugglers or secretly own gas stations and fuel trucks, giving them a share of money earned through illicit sales, U.S. officials say. 
   ``You're talking about corruption at basically every level,'' says Maj. Curtis Buzzard, the Harvard-educated executive officer of the brigade conducting the interdiction push. ``And it's deeply entrenched.'' 
   As part of the campaign, the U.S. in coming months will spend more than $12 million to install video cameras to monitor the refinery's pumps and new digital scales to weigh trucks, making it easier to see if truckers are carrying more fuel than they were meant to receive. The money will also be used to build parking lots designed to protect drivers from extortion and insurgent attack. 
   Over the past few months, U.S. and Iraqi forces already have quietly begun arresting officials suspected of playing central roles in black-market rings. As far back as September, Iraqi forces arrested Ibrahim Muslit, who ran the Bayji refinery's oil-distribution operation, after he allegedly allowed 33 tankers in a single day to receive fuel without any paperwork. In January, U.S. troops arrested Ahmed Ibrahim Hamad, a senior transportation official at the refinery, after he allegedly tried to help smuggle out seven tankers of heavy-fuel oil. Both men are in custody and unavailable for comment. 
   Now, U.S. commanders say they are conducting investigations of senior officials from the Bayji city council, the local police force and the provincial and national governments. The American officers say they have made about 40 arrests since the crackdown began in earnest in early February, when the Iraqis formally joined the campaign, and they hope to make additional arrests in coming weeks. 
   During a surprise inspection of the refinery's gasoline and diesel pumps one afternoon, Sgt. Stephen Truesdale noticed that the analog display on one of the machines showed it had pumped 4,000 liters more than the facility's handwritten records indicated. 
   ``He helped steal 4,000 liters of gas,'' Sgt. Truesdale, a former North Carolina police officer, said of the heavy-set Iraqi man who had been manning the pump. ``The pumps don't lie.'' 
   The refinery worker insisted he was innocent, but Capt. Kuhlman, the brigade leader, told his men they had enough evidence to arrest him. 
   On the way back to their base, the U.S. forces saw a large fuel truck parked on the side of the road, surrounded by pickup trucks carrying overflowing oil barrels. The 18 Iraqis at the site freely admitted they had purchased the fuel from a tanker driver who had left the refinery a short time earlier. The men said they made such purchases several times a week and resold the oil to factory owners and other small businesses in neighboring towns. 
   The American forces ordered the Iraqis to drive their pickups back to the refinery, where the men were searched, photographed and escorted onto a pair of open-backed military vehicles for transport to holding cells at the U.S. installation. 
   The following day, Capt. Kuhlman told a room full of refinery officials and trucking-company executives about the arrests. Shakir Hamid, a businessman who said his partner had been kidnapped from the refinery months earlier, shook his head. 
   ``In Saddam's time, oil smugglers were hung,'' he said. 
   ``And I release them after two days,'' Capt. Kuhlman replied, shrugging his shoulders. ``But it's a start.''  
   Beneath the surface was a battle O'Neill had seen brewing since the NSC meeting on  January 30. It was Powell and his moderates at the State Department versus hard-liners like Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Wolfowitz, who were already planning the next war in Iraq and the shape of a post-Saddam country. 
   Documents were being prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency, Rumsfeld's intelligence arm, mapping Iraq's oil fields and exploration areas and listing companies that might be interested in leveraging the precious asset. 
   One document, headed ``Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield Contracts,'' lists companies from thirty countries--including France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom--their specialties, bidding histories, and in some cases their particular areas of interest. An attached document maps Iraq with markings for ``supergiant oilfield,'' and ``other oilfield,'' and ``earmarked for production sharing,'' while demarking the largely undeveloped southwest of the country into nine ``blocks'' to designate areas for future exploration. The desire to ``dissuade'' countries from engaging in ``asymmetrical challenges'' to the United States--as Rumsfeld said in his January articulation of the demonstrative value of a preemptive attack--matched with plans for how the world's second largest oil reserve might be divided among the world's contractors made for an irresistible combination, O'Neill later said. 
   Already by February, the talk was mostly about logistics. Not the why, but the how and how quickly. Rumsfeld, O'Neill recalled, was focused on how an incident might cause escalated tensions--like the shooting down of an American plane in the regular engagements between U.S. fighters and Iraqi antiaircraft batteries--and what U.S. responses to such an occurrence might be. Wolfowitz was pushing for the arming of Iraqi opposition groups and sending in U.S. troops to support and defend their insurgency. He had written in Foreign Affairs magazine in 1999 that ``the United States should be prepared to commit ground forces to protect a sanctuary in southern Iraq where the opposition could safely mobilize.''   
   Whose Oil Is It, Anyway?  
   Today more than three-quarters of the world's oil is owned and controlled by governments. It wasn't always this way. 
   Until about 35 years ago, the world's oil was largely in the hands of seven corporations based in the United States and Europe. Those seven have since merged into four: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP. They are among the world's largest and most powerful financial empires. But ever since they lost their exclusive control of the oil to the governments, the companies have been trying to get it back. 
   Iraq's oil reserves--thought to be the second largest in the world--have always been high on the corporate wish list. In 1998, Kenneth Derr, then chief executive of Chevron, told a San Francisco audience, ``Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas--reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to.'' 
   A new oil law set to go before the Iraqi Parliament this month would, if passed, go a long way toward helping the oil companies achieve their goal. The Iraq hydrocarbon law would take the majority of Iraq's oil out of the exclusive hands of the Iraqi government and open it to international oil companies for a generation or more. 
   In March 2001, the National Energy Policy Development Group (better known as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force), which included executives of America's largest energy companies, recommended that the United States government support initiatives by Middle Eastern countries ``to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment.'' One invasion and a great deal of political engineering by the Bush administration later, this is exactly what the proposed Iraq oil law would achieve. It does so to the benefit of the companies, but to the great detriment of Iraq's economy, democracy and sovereignty. 
   Since the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration has been aggressive in shepherding the oil law toward passage. It is one of the president's benchmarks for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a fact that Mr. Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Gen. William Casey, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and other administration officials are publicly emphasizing with increasing urgency. 
   The administration has highlighted the law's revenue sharing plan, under which the central government would distribute oil revenues throughout the nation on a per capita basis. But the benefits of this excellent proposal are radically undercut by the law's many other provisions--these allow much (if not most) of Iraq's oil revenues to flow out of the country and into the pockets of international oil companies. 
   The law would transform Iraq's oil industry from a nationalized model closed to American oil companies except for limited (although highly lucrative) marketing contracts, into a commercial industry, all-but-privatized, that is fully open to all international oil companies. 
   The Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control of just 17 of Iraq's 80 known oil fields, leaving two-thirds of known--and all of its as yet undiscovered--fields open to foreign control. 
   The foreign companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies, hire Iraqi workers or share new technologies. They could even ride out Iraq's current ``instability'' by signing contracts now, while the Iraqi government is at its weakest, and then wait at least two years before even setting foot in the country. The vast majority of Iraq's oil would then be left underground for at least two years rather than being used for the country's economic development. 
   The international oil companies could also be offered some of the most corporate-friendly contracts in the world, including what are called production sharing agreements. These agreements are the oil industry's preferred model, but are roundly rejected by all the top oil producing countries in the Middle East because they grant long-term contracts (20 to 35 years in the case of Iraq's draft law) and greater control, ownership and profits to the companies than other models. In fact, they are used for only approximately 12 percent of the world's oil. 
   Iraq's neighbors Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia maintain nationalized oil systems and have outlawed foreign control over oil development. They all hire international oil companies as contractors to provide specific services as needed, for a limited duration, and without giving the foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced. 
   Iraqis may very well choose to use the expertise and experience of international oil companies. They are most likely to do so in a manner that best serves their own needs if they are freed from the tremendous external pressure being exercised by the Bush administration, the oil corporations--and the presence of 140,000 members of the American military. 
   Iraq's five trade union federations, representing hundreds of thousands of workers, released a statement opposing the law and rejecting ``the handing of control over oil to foreign companies, which would undermine the sovereignty of the state and the dignity of the Iraqi people.'' They ask for more time, less pressure and a chance at the democracy they have been promised.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MARKING THE END OF THE 4TH YEAR OF THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) for his superb remarks and for his organizing this Special Order in order to express our opinions on behalf of our troops and for a course correction in Iraq and the Middle East in general. 
   When you think about it, we are being asked this week to vote an additional $100 billion in what is called a supplemental, mainly to escalate the war in Iraq, and the money we are voting on will be just for today until the end of September of this year. This $100 billion is put on top of what has already been appropriated to be spent on  the war, and it is typical of this administration's mishandling the war and its accounting, always underestimating every year what it will really cost to carry out the activities. 
   If you look at the chart that shows what we are spending in Iraq, it is absolutely escalating every single year. 
   The best advice we were given on a recent trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and the region was from our generals, who said: What does victory mean? Victory means one-third military, two-thirds diplomacy and good governance. The two-thirds is missing. So, therefore, we are asking our soldiers to bear all of the burden of a flawed strategy for Iraq and the surrounding regions that is ripening terrorism in every single country, and we are losing respect. The coalition of the willing has dried 
   up. The neighbors of Iraq have not been convened in a constructive way, and we watch other nations in the region border on destabilization because of what we are doing in Iraq. 
   My deep concern is that the violence could spill over into Jordan, Turkey, Bahrain, Kuwait, Pakistan, Lebanon, even Saudi Arabia. And so America has to face a strategic challenge much larger than Iraq, and the administration is not leading us there. 
   This evening I wanted to say a word about the theater in which Iraq is operating. She is not alone. So many of our soldiers, our patriotic brave soldiers, are in Iraq, and they are the finest military in the world, but they exist in a sea of discontent. And I would like to say that the face of terrorism that we see springs from a view, fair or not, that the United States allies with the rich but not the poor across the undemocratic Islamic world. And how can America stand for democracy in Iraq, but not in all of the oil kingdoms and theocracies to which our Nation has been tethered for most of the last century and now into this century? 
   Why would I say that? I would say that because recent polls in the region show exactly that. It shows that America is viewed as not on the side of rising popular expectations for a more democratic way of life. Rather, we are seen as tethered to an old power structure where the poor remain poor, and the rich, outlandishly rich, and becoming more so; and where religion has become the metaphor for political change of those excluded economically and politically. 
   Unfortunately, the Gallup poll shows how harshly the United States is viewed across the region. Right or not, the people there view us as a promiscuous culture in moral decay, and Abu Ghraib affirmed their views. 
   If we look at our closest ally, Turkey, a valued ally of ours for over 50 years in NATO, the disapproval rating of our country has risen from 48 percent in 2000, and we weren't doing so well back then, to 88 percent this year. So 88 percent of the citizens of Turkey disagree and disapprove of what we are doing. 
   The ruling secular party of Turkey has lost control of its Parliament, and now at the local level who is winning elections in Turkey? Parties that are tending more and more religious. And I am not saying that the religious parties of Turkey are like those of Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, but we have to recognize what is happening across the region as America falls into disrepute. 
   In Pakistan, home to tens of thousands of madrassas, schools funded by Wahabi donors from Saudi Arabia, young boys are being turned out by the thousands to revenge against America. 
   America's favorability ratings in Pakistan have fallen to 27 percent. When we were visiting Pakistan a few weeks ago, a female Parliamentarian was assassinated on the western side of the country, people who are trying to relate to the broader world outside of Pakistan. 
   In Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel three decades ago, 70 percent of the public unfavorably views the United States. And more than 90 members of the anti-American Muslim Brotherhood were elected to Parliament recently, and that Parliament has about as many members as we do. So 90-plus members is a significant number in the Egyptian Parliament. 
   I could go down the list. King Abdullah of Jordan was here a couple of weeks ago. What did he ask us for? Peace now, time is short; peace now, time is short. The U.S. favorability rating in Jordan dropped to 15 percent. Are we paying attention to what is going on? 
   My dear colleague Mr. Hinchey talked about Saudi Arabia, where the majority of 9/11 terrorists had come from. The United States is disliked by three-quarters of the people in Saudi Arabia. So we look at our troops inside of Iraq because the Commander in Chief of this country sent them there, but if we look at what is happening in the region, America is not winning. 
   One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle just said, just measure the body count. Measure the American losses as a sign of how well we are doing. 
   It is taking us twice as much money every year just to keep the body count where it is now. Look at the casualties. Look at the Iraqi casualties that no one wants to talk about. Look at what is happening in the region. We are not being successful in the war on terrorism, as hard as our soldiers try, because they cannot do it alone.     
   Why are we asking the military to bear the full burden when the diplomatic channels of this government have crashed? 
   Can you believe that the neighbors of Iraq have not been assembled by our Secretary of State in any constructive way now going on 4 years? Unbelievable. 
   Can you believe that we have allowed nations with which we have been friends for 50 years just to fester at the end of a failed diplomatic pipeline? 
   The President's job is not just to be Commander in Chief. It is to be Diplomat in Chief for this country, and yet across that region we see ties that have been forged by this country for generations just ripped into shreds. What a tragedy. 
   I was thinking yesterday, I grew up in an era when John Kennedy talked about the Peace Corps and the great alliance for progress across Latin America. Look at the Latin Americans demonstrating against the United States. 
   We cannot ask our soldiers to fill a gap, a failed diplomacy and failed politics across the region. The world wants change. The world is begging us for change. The world is demonstrating for change. It just is not America that is demonstrating for change. 
   So this evening, Mr. Speaker, I would thank my colleague so very much for allowing me some time to talk about regaining America's standing in the world by correcting what has gone wrong in Iraq. 
   I just might end by saying today in USA Today there was a major story of Poland, people risking their lives going to Iraq, asking the Iraqi people what they think. What it shows is compared to 2005, just a couple years ago, when 71 percent of people in Iraq said their life was fairly good, today it has dropped to 39 percent. 
   In Baghdad, where so many of our soldiers are being sent, what percentage of the people rate their basic household needs as being served by the current regime? You know what the number is? Zero. Zero. Fallen in the last 2 years from 78 percent of their basic household needs. That is like food, water, down to zero. 
   Electricity, you know what percent of the people in Baghdad say their service is good? Zero. Zero, down from only half in 2005. 
   What about clean water? In 2005, 68 percent said they could get clean water. You know what the number is? Zero. 
   How can this be good? How can America win this? How can we ask our soldiers to fill a failed policy? Our soldiers will do anything we ask them to do. We have the best military in the world. We have the most committed generals, the most committed soldiers. We love every single one of them, but we do not want to give them a mission impossible in a sea of discontent where the Diplomat in Chief has abdicated his responsibility to them and to the kind of strategy that can win America friends again. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and it is a real privilege to be able to participate in this Special Order this evening.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise to honor the life of Lt. Col. Kevin Sonnenberg of the Ohio National Guard, another American war hero who was laid to rest today in his beloved State of Ohio. His peers have noted that Col. Sonnenberg will be remembered as a fearless fighter pilot who perished before his time serving the Nation he loved. 
   Col. Sonnenberg died on the 15th of June, 2007, when his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed near Balad Air Base in Iraq, shortly after takeoff. 
   He had just departed on a mission to provide air support to Coalition ground forces fighting anti-Iraq forces. 
   Colonel Kevin Sonnenberg was an instructor pilot and C Flight Commander assigned to the 112th Fighter Squadron in Toledo, Ohio. He had numerous deployments with the unit, including Operation Northern Watch, Turkey; Operation Southern Watch, Kuwait; Operation Enduring Freedom, Qatar; and Operation Iraqi Freedom, Iraq. He truly is an American hero. 
   Colonel Sonnenberg was well decorated for his service during these missions, receiving awards and decorations including: The Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal with Valor, the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal with two Devices, the Air Force Achievement Medal with two Devices, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award with Gold Border, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with one Device, the Combat Readiness Medal with four Devices, the National Defense Service Medal with one Device, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terror Service Medal, the Air Expeditionary Ribbon with Gold Border, the Air Force Longevity Service Award with three Devices, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with four Devices, the Bronze Hourglass ``M'', Arabic four, Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon with one Device, the Air Force Training Ribbon, the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal with Valor, and the Ohio Faithful Service Ribbon with two Devices. 
   A 1983 graduate of Napoleon High School, Kevin Sonnenberg earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Bowling Green State University in 1987. He graduated from the Academy of Military Science in 1991, followed by the Squadron Officers School in 2001 and the Air Command and Staff College in 2007. 
   An Instructor Pilot of F-16s with more than 1,900 hours flown, Lieutenant Colonel Sonnenberg served several assignments in his tenure with the Ohio Air National Guard, including his most recent with the 112th Fighter Squadron. 
   A traditional member of the Ohio National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Sonnenberg was also a commercial pilot and farmer. He had been a commercial airline pilot with Delta Airlines since from 2000 until his death. He grew up farming with his father and remained devoted to their partnership. 
   In the Great War of the last century, the poet Alfred Noyes penned his thoughts about English fighter pilots in ``To the Royal Air Force.'' His words written so long ago capture the spirit of today's F-16 fighter pilots and Kevin Sonnenberg when he wrote, 
   ``Whether at midnight or at noon, 
   ``Through mist or open sky, 
   ``Eagles of freedom, all our hearts 
   ``Are up with you on high ..... 
   ``From realms beyond the sun 
   ``And whisper, as their record pales, 
   ``Their breathless, deep, Well Done!'' 
   His fellow airmen wrote that, ``Lieutenant Colonel Sonnenberg will be remembered as a Renaissance man, able to maneuver America's most advanced aircraft in a perilous war zone one week and then discuss corn and soybean crops with Henry County farmers the next. And he did both with his natural, down-home nature that endeared him to so many across Ohio, the Air Force and the world. He should be honored as a patriot whose commitment to his country was surpassed only by his devotion to God.'' 
   Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Sonnenberg was a man of action, a man of character, a man who revered God and country and family. He drank deep from the cup of life and lived the journey well, though too short. I imagine he would concur with the words of Christina Rosetti in her poem, ``Remember'': 
   ``Remember me when I am gone away, 
   ``Gone far away into the silent land; 
   ``When you can no more hold me by the hand, 
   ``Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay. 
   ``Remember me when no more day by day.'' 
   I would like to close my remarks by paying tribute to him on behalf of the F-16 fighter pilots of the 180th Tactical Fighter Squadron in our region, to their support staff, to all the members of the Ohio National Guard, to their families and all Buckeyes who truly revered this man's life. 
   Just about a month and a half ago, I wished off that unit with over 350 members of the Ohio National Guard to fly to Iraq to join their colleagues who have been based there for several months. I gave Kevin Sonnenberg a hug before he left, as I did to every F-16 pilot that left. 
   This F-16 unit is the best that America has. They rank at the top of every single measure that this Nation has. He was among the finest of the finest in our country. He gave his all to us. He did all he was asked to do. He died loving his family, his country and his God; and we love him and his family and his country and our God. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we end this evening in tribute to the life of a great American airman.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CLEAN ENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I was pleased to cast my vote today for the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. 
   Some of us have been urging energy independence for decades. In fact, President Jimmy Carter had it right over three decades ago when he said the Arab oil embargo was the moral equivalent of war. But America lost sight of his compelling vision for energy independence. We need to give birth to a new sustainable energy age that is bold and develops alternative energy supplies and the infrastructure to support it. 
   President Bush suddenly realized last year that we have become addicted to foreign oil, of course, most of it coming from the most undemocratic regimes in the world. But during his administration, we are importing 1 billion more barrels of oil from those very undemocratic places since he assumed office. Simply put, his rhetoric doesn't match reality. 
   I am pleased today that we took some important steps in shifting how Federal resources are dedicated, taking them away from preferential treatment to an oil industry with record profits and little social conscience. Instead, we must incentivize a domestically owned energy industry that has record potential, a shift that America wants and we must take. 
   While $14 billion over 10 years is nothing to ignore, it is still far too little, especially since more than a third of this amount, a little more than $5 billion, doesn't become available until the 10th year. According to the Government Accountability Office, this government has spent more than $130 billion on subsidies to the oil industry over the last 3 1/2 decades. So today's step forward is the first rung of the ladder to energy independence. 
   As this country spends billions on oil addiction, 75 percent of it being imported from the most undemocratic places in the world, I might repeat, consider an estimate by the Congressional Research Service which shows the recent increase in oil prices accounts for an additional $60 to $75 billion rise in our country's abysmal trade deficit. 
   While the oil companies manipulate the market, they continue to rake in billions. During President Bush's tenure, their profits have been record. From 2001 until the first quarter of 2006, ExxonMobil, alone, made $118.2 billion. Now, in the bill today we talk about $14 billion over 10 years. They made $118.2 billion over the last 3 years. Shell has earned $82.3 billion. Shell, one company. BP has made $67.8 billion. Our bill today had $14 billion over 10 years. Chevron Texaco has made $43.1 billion, and Conoco Phillips made $31.1 billion. 
   We are talking $14 billion over 10 years, with $5 billion in the very last year. Recognizing that those companies' profits were beginning to infuriate the public, does it surprise you that gasoline prices just happened to drop 75 cents a gallon during the run-up to last year's election for Congress? 
   As we consider this bill today, prices across our Nation, conveniently, are dropping. Imagine, in a place like Toledo, Ohio, they dropped from $2.40 a gallon to $1.75 a gallon. Isn't that strange during the week that we considered this bill? 
   Imagine an industry earning so much in profits it can manipulate the world and manipulate every single person in our country. Imagine the jobs we could create if we were to dedicate $14 billion, not over 10 years, but each month, rather than spending that money on oil wars in far-flung places, invest it in solar, in wind, in geothermal, in photovoltaic energy, in fuel cells and hydrogen and clean coal production and distribution. Imagine the jobs we could create if we had vision. 
   These accomplishments that we seek will require not just real imagination, but real leadership. Hopefully this bill today offers a glimmer. America will, at long last, at long last, take seriously what President Jimmy Carter envisioned. He was right then. He remains right today: America must become energy independent. Our people want it. Why shouldn't this Congress deliver it?

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (COLOMBIA AND OIL: GET IT WHILE YOU CAN -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration announced this week it will be sending to the Congress for approval the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. And the American people might ask, Colombia? Now? In 2008? What about the District of Columbia and getting gas prices lower here in our Nation's capital? Or what about more fairly priced student loans for the next generation who are attempting to improve their opportunities for the years ahead? Or what about dealing with mortgage foreclosures in the United States, which are at epidemic levels in places like Ohio and Michigan and Florida and California? No. The President sends us something to help another country. ``Colombia Free Trade,'' they call it. 
   Well, I would like to say to the American people tear the veneer off the agreement and look below it, and what you will find is crude. Oil. What this agreement really is about is more imported petroleum from one of the most undemocratic places in the world. 
   Colombia about 10 years ago was actually a net importer of oil. But today it is the fourth leading oil producer in South America. In fact, oil, rock/crude, has become Colombia's leading export product, and guess whom they send most of it to? You've got it right. The United States of America. 
   So what this Colombia Free Trade deal is all about is more imported oil, more dirty crude, more carbon emissions, more dependency of the people of the United States for energy, more living back in the 20th Century than embracing the 21st with energy independence here at home. 
   The oil picture in Colombia is clouded by rapidly declining production because of persistent attacks from people inside Colombia. What no one has mentioned, and the President didn't send it up here in his statement, is our country is already sending billions of dollars to Colombia to hold up the government. Why? To protect certain economic interests, including the rising export of petroleum. 
   This is a graph showing production levels of petroleum in Colombia back since the late 1980s, then up through 2000, when all of a sudden they started to decline because of unrest inside the country itself. 
   Now, it's no secret that there are 18 foreign oil companies in Colombia. Guess what. The majority of their headquarters is located right here in the United States. They have drilling operations in Colombia. California-based Occidental Petroleum launched an attempt to squeeze out of Colombia what oil remains with its discovery in 1983 of the Cano Limon field in the northeastern part of the country. The problem is that particular field produces less than a third of its total as recently as 4 years ago. Its production is going down. 
   British Petroleum, not to be outdone, has been drilling in the eastern plains in the Andes Mountains in the largest field in the country. However, that production has fallen by about two-thirds, and rather than 400,000 barrels a day, they produce about 170,000 barrels. 
   Faced with rapidly declining production, the Colombian Government has taken steps to improve the investment climate in Colombia and giving permission for foreign oil companies to own 100 percent stakes in oil ventures in Colombia. The Government of Colombia also established a lower sliding scale royalty fee, now at 8 percent on the smallest oil fields, and that set of actions have attracted an estimated $2 billion more in foreign investments since 2006. The oil industry is focusing heavily on this country. 
   Entering into the picture is the geopolitical position of Colombia because if we look at the United States having nearly half of their exports, Venezuela is number two, and we all know the difficulties with Venezuela. So there's a little strategic problem here related to the U.S. perception across Latin America. But it's important to tear the veneer off something called ``Colombia Free Trade'' and look at what is actually being traded out of Colombia. 
   While the United States continues to support the violent regime in Colombia, political unrest and political repression continue to cloud the discussion, and declining oil exports prove it. We can go back to 1988 when a car bomb outside of Occidental's nine-story Colombian headquarters in Bogota badly damaged that building. In October, 2000, a truck bomb nearly missed a bus filled with 40 Occidental secretaries and other company employees. And in April, 2001, rebels seized a bus filled with 100 Occidental oil workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm going to include in the Record lots of information about Occidental Petroleum, which is just one example of what's happening in Colombia, and also some of Occidental Petroleum's political influence here in Washington, in the Congress and in the White House. 
   Occidental Petroleum Corporation 
   Occidental Petroleum Corporation is one of the largest U.S.-based oil and gas multinationals, with exploration projects in three states and nine foreign countries, including Colombia. It has operated in Colombia for more than three decades; in 1983, Occidental discovered Ca&#241;o Lim&#243;n, Colombia's second-largest oil field and one of only 50 billion-barrel-class fields in the world. Occidental's investment in Ca&#241;o Lim&#243;n paid off long ago, with its share of production yielding hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Even through years of rebel attacks and pipeline closings, Ca&#241;o Lim&#243;n Field continues to be a profitable venture for Occidental. 
   In recent years, Occidental has simplified its oil and gas operations by focusing its operations in the United States, the Middle East and Latin America. Despite drastic oil price declines in 2001, Occidental Petroleum had its second-best annual earnings ever. 
   Annual sales: $14 billion 
   Annual net income: $1.2 billion. 
   CEO and annual executive salary: Ray Irani, $24 million (six-year average); Forbes Magazine ranked Irani the second-worst among executives who gave shareholders the least return on their investment compared with their own pay. In 2001, Irani's compensation package included free financial planning, country club dues and a $2.6 million bonus. 
   Founded: 1920. 
   Stock: Publicly traded (OXY) on the New York Stock Exchange. 
   Corporate headquarters: Los Angeles. 
   Employees: 8,235. 
   Colombia operations: Occidental owns Ca&#241;o Lim&#243;n Field in the province of Aruaca,  operates three exploration projects elsewhere in Colombia, and, in 1998, swapped its holdings in the Philippines and Malaysia for Shell Oil's interests in several producing blocks of Colombia. 
   Worldwide holdings: Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Oman, Ecuador, the Gulf of Mexico, the United States (Texas, California and Alaska). 
   Worldwide reserves: 2.17 billion barrels of oil. 
   Worldwide annual production: 461,000 barrels of oil per day. 
   Colombia annual production: 34,000 barrels of oil per day in 2002, up 79 percent from the year before.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICA'S GROWING TRADE DEFICIT -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, our Nation needs a course correction in our foreign policy, and we are being given the chance by the Democratic leadership this week to debate it fully, as we should have when that resolution was first debated in this House. 
   Our country needs many course corrections, including on the economy. President Bush's trade policy has clearly failed, as his foreign policy has, as American workers and American businesses find we are losing more jobs to imports again. The confirmed numbers for 2006 released today show that the annual trade deficit in 2006 doubled since this President took office. 
   In fact, for 2006 the trade deficit equaled $763.6 billion and broke the prior year's trade deficit by adding another 6 percent more deficit from 2005's level of $716 billion. 
   Five straight years of record deficits have left millions more Americans with displaced jobs, outsourced jobs, unemployment across regions of this country, and putting our financial future in the hands of foreign creditors such as China and Saudi Arabia. 
   Mr. Speaker, to grant renewed fast track authority to this President would be a serious mistake and irresponsible. This administration needs a course correction by this Congress, both in foreign policy and in domestic economic policy.

   Ms. KAPTUR. American taxpayers, think about this: So far this year the Bush administration has put you on the hook for $30 billion to prop up an investment house on Wall Street, Bear Stearns. Now you have been pledged to insure $200 billion to $2.4 trillion for the stock of loss-plagued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And taxpayers this week have been put on the hook for the insurance company American International Group to the tune of $85 billion. It seems like for Messrs. Paulson and Bernanke, any blank check for Wall Street can't be bigger. Every day it gets bigger. 
   Now, what about Main Street? In the State of Ohio, we are hemorrhaging with mortgage foreclosures. There are no workouts. Messrs. Paulson and Bernanke haven't come to Ohio to make some of that cash available. Ohio needs $20 billion to do workouts now. We will have over 100,000 more foreclosures this year. All that legislation we passed here in Congress, it has no bite, because it isn't helping people now. 
   We need some attention to Main Street, not just Wall Street.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FUNDING THE BUSH PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this should be the season of selfless giving, a season where Americans give without any expectation of reward. This should  be a season of joy and happiness when millions enjoy the company of their families and loved ones. But as some of our Nation's elites celebrate this time of giving, they do so with the knowledge that every dollar they give in politics is actually an investment in influence peddling. 
   Instead of corrupting this season of giving, I hope our public officials will give something back to the American people, something more powerful than money: hope in our government that should be responding to people's needs, not the needs of the powerful few. 
   The latest example of this sickness afflicting American politics is reflected in our political system being bought out from under us through the system of Presidential libraries whose principals seek to find investors from other countries to help to promote their legacy in perpetuity. Don't believe the logic? Just then follow the money. With President Bush desperately trying to salvage his legacy, action is heating up on funding his Presidential library. While donors to George W. Bush's Presidential library represent a Who's Who in Republican politics, some of these donors have significant business with the White House. According to a recent Harpers magazine article, a wealthy Texas oil man, Ray Hunt, reportedly gave $35 million, $35 million to the Bush Presidential Library. 
   This same businessman was a big campaign contributor to the Bush-Cheney campaign and, coincidentally, has a stake in a nearly billion-dollar proposal to pipe out Peruvian natural gas. All of our friends who participated in the recent debate on Peru free trade ought to think about this one. In addition, Mr. Hunt is closely involved with a ``legally questionable'' exploration deal with the Iraqi Kurds. Interesting set of friends in this White House. 
   Estimates now indicate the George W. Bush Presidential Library will cost up to half a billion dollars. A half a billion dollars. Why should a sitting United States President be involved with raising nearly unlimited amounts of money from those seeking influence? The American people surely are not blind. They understand that money buys influence, and a system allowing millions of dollars in unregulated cash corrupts all tents of democracy. We must patch this gaping loophole and prevent the leader of the free world from raising unlimited and unregulated funds for a pet project. This creates as direct a link as one can imagine between money and influence. 
   With House passage of H.R. 1254, the House of Representatives has clearly demonstrated its intent to provide more accountability for donations made to Presidential libraries. While this legislation is an important step in mandating the disclosure of all donations of more than $200, it does not require the disclosure of all donations from foreign governments, foreign individuals and foreign corporations. The Senate, the other body, should act on Congressman Wexler's legislation and move forward in giving this legislation teeth. 
   I would like to place in the Record an important article that I referenced in Harper's Magazine, the title of which is, ``On the Hunt: Bush backer seeks $1 billion for Peru project,'' and also an excellent article that was in The Washington Post this past weekend, the headline of which reads, ``Clinton Library Got Funds From Abroad. Saudis said to have given $10 million.'' I ask to include these articles in the Record. 
   This article then goes on to talk about President Bill Clinton's Presidential library, its cost over $165 million, in which foreign sources helped contribute to that, with the most generous overseas donation coming from Saudi Arabia. Now, the last time I looked, Saudi Arabia is the country that sent the vast majority of 9/11 hijackers here. So why should any United States President take money from those kinds of interests? 
   It seems to me that these Presidential libraries have gone way overboard. Why can't the Archives just take the records. Why do we need all these palaces created around the country for some of these Presidents? What kind of legacy are they leaving us anyway; a Nation that has been hemorrhaging jobs from coast to coast, a Nation that is terribly in debt, in hock, with over half of our U.S. Government bonds now being sold to foreign interests. 
   President Lincoln never did anything like that. His service was so great, the American people recognized it for what it was. The same was true with Franklin Roosevelt. Why do we have to have these modern-day palaces to egos of these current-day Presidents? It seems to me that Congress ought to curb this really disgusting behavior, because you never really know when you're meeting with a President of the United States and a foreign leader if they are going to be begging money for a library they wish to create for themselves. 
   Madam Speaker, we need reform in this area as well.  
   On the Hunt: Bush Backer Seeks $1 Billion for Peru Project  
   Beginning tomorrow and over the next few weeks, the World Bank and other lenders will be voting, apparently in favor, on a package worth more than $1 billion to support a controversial pipeline project in Peru. The primary company that would benefit from that money is Hunt Oil, which is headed by Ray Hunt, a Texas oilman who raised huge sums for the Bush/Cheney campaigns and who reportedly has given $35 million for the upcoming Bush Presidential Library. Hunt Oil has recently generated controversy of its own, by signing what the New York Times called a ``legally questionable'' exploration deal with Iraqi Kurds. 
   The Hunt-led project would ``build a pipeline, a gas liquefaction plant, marine terminal and other facilities to export 4.4 million tons of liquid natural gas annually,'' according to a 2006 story in the Washington Post. The pipeline would ship liquid natural gas that originates in the Camisea Field of Peru's Amazonian rain forest and send it to Mexico and from there, possibly, to U.S. markets. 
   The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in which the U.S. holds a thirty percent stake, will vote tomorrow on up to $900 million in loans for the Hunt Oil project. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) decides Thursday whether to allocate several hundred million dollars worth of support, and the World Bank will vote on a similar amount in January. The IDB already backed an earlier phase of the Camisea project, which has been plagued by problems. Among the troubles, the Post said, were the spilling of ``thousands of barrels into pristine rivers and killing the fish upon which indigenous communities depend for their livelihood.'' 
   A number of Peruvian and American groups--including Environmental Defense, Oxfam America, and World Wildlife Fund--are asking for further evaluation of the project before multilateral loans are approved. They point to three broad areas of concern. First are social and environmental issues, as the project runs through a spectacular stretch of the Amazon that is home to 12,000 indigenous people. ``The lenders have sold themselves cheap and are not setting high enough standards for their participation,'' said Aaron Goldzimer of Environmental Defense. 
   Similar concerns were expressed in a December 12 letter to Ex-Im from Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont--chairman of the subcommittee which monitors Ex-Im and approves the U.S. contribution to the IDB and World Bank--and his House counterpart, Congresswoman Nita Lowey of New York. They wrote: 
   It is ..... our understanding that there are unfulfilled commitments and serious failures, risks and concerns still pending from the first phase of the project. These include a lack of fully independent monitoring; ongoing corruption investigations ..... new planned infrastructure in the Nahua Kugapakori Reserve which may violate previous commitments; a government audit released last month that identified significant problems with pipeline construction ..... and significant impacts on local culture, human health, fisheries and biodiversity that have not been adequately assessed much less addressed. 
   Second, the Peruvian government of President Alan Garcia has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dismantle the country's already weak social and environmental institutions. The government recently fired nearly all the directors of a federal environmental authority, and replaced them with political hacks. (Sound familiar?) Garcia recently axed the country's superintendent of protected areas when he voiced objections to a proposal that would opened up a large swath of the Bahuaja Sonene National Park for energy exploration. 
   Garcia has been attacking critics of domestic energy projects as commies and pro-poverty advocates. Meanwhile, the entire Peruvian Amazon has been divided into concessions for oil and gas development. Two years ago, only 15 percent of the Amazon had been parceled out for energy development. Garcia will undoubtedly take multilateral bank support for the Hunt project as a stamp of approval for his approach and use it to further steamroll his domestic opponents. 
   Lastly, the economic benefits of the project for Hunt Oil are quite clear but far more dubious in the case of Peru. In their letter to Ex-Imp, Leahy and Lowey said they were concerned that Peru did not have sufficient gas reserves to meet both long-term export requirements and domestic demand.  What that means is that Peru might well pay more for energy imports down the road than it gets now for its exports. Glenn Jenkins, founder of the Program on Investment Appraisal and Management at the Harvard Institute for International Development, prepared an economic analysis of the project for Environmental Defense. He concluded that massive new reserves are discovered, Peru would be worse off from an economic perspective if the project proceeds. 
   Back in 2003, the Ex-Im, surprisingly, rejected support for the first phase of the project on environmental grounds, and the Bush Administration abstained during the IDB vote. Ray Hunt and his company have been aggressively lobbying in Washington to make sure the administration supports the proposed multilateral funding this time around. Early indications are that the company has succeeded and that the IDB, Ex-Im and World Bank will end up approving support.   
   Clinton Library Got Funds From Abroad--Saudis Said To Have Given $10 Million  
   Bill Clinton's presidential library raised more than 10 percent of the cost of its $165 million facility from foreign sources, with the most generous overseas donation coming from Saudi Arabia, according to interviews yesterday. 
   The royal family of Saudi Arabia gave the Clinton facility in Little Rock about $10 million, roughly the same amount it gave toward the presidential library of George H.W. Bush, according to people directly familiar with the contributions. 
   The presidential campaign of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has for months faced questions about the source of the money for her husband's presidential library. During a September debate, moderator Tim Russert asked the senator whether her husband would release a donor list. Clinton said she was sure her husband would ``be happy to consider that,'' though the former president later declined to provide a list of donors. 
   Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has made an issue of the large yet unidentified contributors to presidential libraries, saying that he wants to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in such donations. Obama has introduced legislation that would require disclosure of all contributions to presidential libraries, including Clinton's, and Congress has actively debated such a proposal. Unlike campaign donations, money given to presidential libraries is often done with limited or no disclosure. 
   The Clinton library has steadfastly declined to reveal its donors, saying they were promised confidentiality. The William J. Clinton Foundation, which funds the library, is considered a charity whose contributors can remain anonymous. 
   In response to questions from The Washington Post, the foundation reiterated that it would not discuss specific sizes or sources of donations to honor the commitment it made to donors. But it acknowledged that some of the money Clinton received from the library came from foreign sources. 
   ``As president. he was beloved around the world, so it should come as no surprise that there has been an outpouring of financial support from around the world to sustain his post-presidential work,'' a foundation statement said. 
   Bill Clinton has solicited donations for the library personally, aides said, but he also delegated much of the fundraising to others, especially Terence R. McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The foundation statement stressed that he has turned over the facility to taxpayers, as other former presidents have. 
   A handful of major donors' names to the Clinton library were disclosed in 2004 when a New York Sun reporter accessed a public computer terminal at the library that provided a list of donors. Soon after the article appeared, the list of donors was removed. 
   The amount of the contribution from Saudi Arabia and several other countries, as well as the percentage of the total given by foreigners, had not been revealed. 
   The Post confirmed numerous seven-figure donors to the library through interviews and tax records of foundations. Several foreign governments gave at least $1 million, including the Middle Eastern nations of Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the governments of Taiwan and Brunei. 
   In addition, a handful of Middle Eastern business executives and officials also gave at least $1 million each, according to the interviews. They include Saudi businessmen Abdullah al-Dabbagh. Nasser al-Rashid and Walid Juffali, as well as Issam Fares, a U.S. citizen who previously served as deputy prime minister of Lebanon.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FORECLOSURE -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the housing foreclosure crisis in America is getting worse. Last February alone  brought another quarter of a million foreclosures, 223,561 families. Last year, in 2007, our Nation suffered 1.6 million foreclosures, the largest equity washout in our history. That's 1.6 million families, probably between 4 and 5 million people, who have destroyed credit and who lost their homes. Their lives have been thrown into chaos. 
   Despite the death grip that mortgage foreclosures are having in this country, Washington has yet to offer a credible solution. Back home my constituents are demanding to know what is taking so long. The huge jumps in foreclosures were becoming evident in 2006. Experts have forecast an even larger increase based on loan resets on adjustable rate mortgages. Still no credible action from the Bush administration or this Congress. One has to wonder why Washington has not moved more decisively to enact legislation when no congressional district has gone unaffected by this crisis. In whose interest is it to have so many Americans, by the millions, falling off the edge of the mortgage cliff? 
   The Bush administration should take real action. It isn't. This Congress should take real effective action. It hasn't. It is clear what will happen if we don't. Another 2.9 million loans were past due last December, signaling high rates of foreclosure to come. Another 40 million homeowners are at risk of seeing their property values decline, and 12.5 million will have either zero or negative net equity in their home. In fact, America has reached a very dangerous position. For the first time in our history, people owe more on their homes than their homes are worth. People owe more on their homes than their homes are worth. Net negative home equity. 
   Despite the great fanfare associated with government compacts and rescue hotlines, many servicers and investment banks are still refusing to come to the table. I've received a long list of servicers who can't be reached or who refuse to pursue workouts, including the banks that hold the mortgages that were serviced, when housing counselors and homeowners try to reach out to them at the local level. They used to call that ``taking the lamb.'' They've disappeared, and, therefore, there is no one to work it out with. 
   Counseling services at the local level are overrun with desperate homeowners, many of whom could be helped if they weren't on long waiting lists for counseling assistance and could find with whom they should work out that mortgage. What good is the $180 million in housing counseling funds we passed in Congress last year if the majority of servicers are still refusing those workouts and if that 180 million wasn't targeted to the districts that are most in need? And it wasn't. 
   Of those who are willing to engage in workouts, most only offer repayment plans, giving homeowners additional time to catch up with their payments. But this begs the question if homeowners cannot keep up with their regular payments, what good does it do them to offer them a chance to catch up by making double and triple payments? 
   One of my constituents was offered such a ``deal.'' He tells me that the bank will allow him to save his home if he just comes up with $40,000 by October. This gentleman, who has lived in his home for more than two decades, has a low fixed income with no hope of coming up with such a large sum. His lender is offering concessions in name only. 
   A few servicers who are engaging in workouts are moving toward modifying the terms of the loans, reducing principal, lowering interest rates, extending the terms of the loan, to make them more affordable. We need much more of that. But the relatively small segment of the industry that is willing to do so, coupled with the painfully slow pace of working out individual plans, only drives America into deeper crisis. 
   More effective solutions should be forthcoming from this Congress, including bankruptcy bills like that of Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS and Congressman BRAD MILLER, which would allow judges now the flexibility to modify the terms of mortgage loans in bankruptcy court proceedings by lowering interest rates, forgiving penalties, reducing principal, and getting those servicers and banks to the table. Of course they don't want that. Too bad. The crisis is an American crisis and it needs an American solution. 
   To tread water while this disaster unfolds is wrong. It's not just about helping homeowners. It's about helping our Nation's economy and trying to rebuild the economic strength that we have lost through this deepening crisis.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JO ANN DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for yielding me this time, and on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio and myself, the senior woman in this House, I would like to express deepest condolences to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia on the passing of Jo Ann Davis, our very, very respected colleague, from this life. 
   To her husband, Chuck, to her two sons, to her granddaughter, we respected Jo Ann as a woman, as a Member, as a wife, as a mother, as a grandmother. We also respected her because she was an heroic Member of this Congress. 
   There are some people in life who teach us how to live, and then there are those rare few who teach us how to die. Jo Ann Davis was such an individual. She held herself with great courage. 
   As a woman, I might like to put on the Record that in the entire history of this institution there have been very few women that have actually served here. Out of a little over 11,000 Members of our Republic who have been elected to Congress, about 200 or so have been elected as women. And so we know that with every woman who is elected, a new page in history is written. It may seem easy, but it is very, very hard. Jo Ann Davis was a part of that new page in history of this Republic. 
   Others have stated, of course, she was the first Republican woman to have been elected from Virginia, and so we know in having met her, we met a pioneering woman, a woman who truly is a first. That took great stamina; it took rare courage and great perseverance. 
   She had other careers before she came here, as a Realtor, as a member of her own State legislature, and upon being elected here, she was then elected to some of the most weighty committees in this institution: to Defense, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, always a woman who stood tall for those in the uniformed service of our country. 
   She had a warm and radiant smile, and she held herself erect and with a stalwart stance that revealed the strength of character that represented Jo Ann Davis' entire life. You knew she would meet all of life's challenges, and she did. 
   Her faith imbued her with that strength, and it also imbued the kindness that she demonstrated to every Member of this institution, a warm cordiality, and also in her closing days on Earth, great dignity in her heroic struggle. 
   It was my privilege to know her and to be allowed to serve with her during the years that she gave to the people of this great Republic. 
   May she rest in peace.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, every time the United States signs a free trade agreement with a developing country, this time the Bush Peru agreement, we end up outsourcing more wealth and more middle-class jobs. We're already in deficit with Peru under existing conditions. And just like Mexico, when we signed that agreement, we went from a surplus to a gigantic deficit. 
   If labor provisions in the agreement are so good, why are no trade unions in our country or Peru supporting the agreement? Could it be because the agreement does not require the Peruvians to comply with core labor ``rights'', but rather, with vague and unenforceable labor ``principles'' which are then cleverly placed in the preamble or the declaration of the agreement and not in the enforceable and binding core standards, as do the International Labor Organization conventions? 
   You know, this week the Peruvian miners are talking to us. They are on  strike; 6,300 miners who mine gold and silver and zinc and copper and molybdenum in that country. They're on strike but the Peru Labor Ministry has ordered them back to work or they will lose their jobs in 3 days. Isn't it time for us to hear the voices of the people of Peru as well as the voices of the people of our own country who have lost so many jobs due to these unfair trade agreements? 
   Peru doesn't intend to enforce international labor rights.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I only wish we could have had these moments before the Ways and Means Committee itself, the respect Members should be afforded when their State's lost over 200,000 jobs and our Nation millions of jobs to these trade agreements. At least we have earned the respect. I am sorry that we only get 5 minutes on the floor. So many people are depending on us. 
   We know that every time this country signs a free trade agreement with a developing country we end up outsourcing more wealth and middle-class jobs. U.S. companies are shuttering faster than we can count. If these trade agreements were working, America's trade deficit would not be ringing in at over $800 billion this year, and for every billion, 20,000 more jobs lost in this country. What an unprecedented wipeout of productive wealth and of jobs and of lives. The sliding value of the dollar proves it, our staggering debt levels prove it, and the growing stock market instability proves it. 
   If we put it in perspective, we were told that when NAFTA passed, and I voted against that in 1993, our Speaker voted for it, our majority leader voted for it, I remember that vote very clearly, we were told that though we had a surplus with Mexico, it would grow. What happened? We have fallen into deeper and deeper deficit with Mexico every year. And over 2 million Mexican peasants were upended from their farmland, creating an endless flow of illegal immigration to this country, because we were not allowed to offer amendments to provide adjustment provisions in those agreements for the people of the Third World. Shame on us. 
   Then we were told, well, let's move to China. When the China PNTR was signed, we weren't in trade balance with China; we were actually in trade deficit. But after PNTR was signed, the deficit doubled and tripled. The Speaker talked about that tonight. It didn't get any better; it just got worse. And now we are getting all of the tainted food and the toys with lead and so forth. 
   The Jordan Free Trade Agreement had environmental and labor provisions. They said, that is the dawn of a new decade. Just what they are saying tonight. Guess what? No enforcement. We know that. They don't intend to do that. They never did. 
   Now tonight we look at Peru. Now, with Peru we are already in deficit; in fact, over $3 billion in deficit with Peru. I hope the Ways and Means Committee staffer is adding this up, because, you see, the numbers are in the wrong direction. That is why the value of the dollar is terrible. 
   What is interesting about Peru, though, what is the largest export from Peru to the United States? Gold. Gold. How convenient. And Peru is the largest silver producing country in the world. 
   Look at the commodities markets. In whose interest would it be to bring in more of that here? And we have heard that Caterpillar now wants to move its production to serve those mines down in Peru. They are not going to send tractors from Illinois to Peru. They are going to move the production to Peru and pay those workers nothing. We have seen the pattern before. Now, please, don't take us to be idiots. 
   We think about Del Monte and Green Giant. They used to manufacture. They had all of their product processed in Watsonville, California. I have been there. My uncles used to work there. Guess what? It is gone down there. 
   Do you think they pay these farmers anything? No. We are going to lose 3 million Peruvian farmers. They are going to be upended just like the Mexican campesinos were. Have we no heart? Some people have no heart. We have heart. We are down here tonight. We can't forget them. 
   I remember Congressman Kucinich was talking about Citigroup. Citigroup. They just wrote off $11 billion Sunday night, in the wee hours of the night so maybe nobody would notice. Citigroup has got a little problem with subprime mortgages, so they want to manage now the pensions of the world. 
   They can't manage Social Security yet, so guess where they are going?  They are going to Peru. They want to manage those dollars, and lots of other pension funds in this country. They are in trouble. They made mistakes. They robbed the American people, and I sure hope they don't come to this Congress for help, because we shouldn't be paying to bail them out. They are going to go to Peru, and under this agreement, it makes it easier for them to do that. 
   Tonight I genuflect, not before the Ways and Means Committee, but before the mine workers of Peru who are on strike. They went on strike Monday because these gold exporting firms are making billions. They doubled their dividends in companies like Newmont, which just happens to be an American company that owns the biggest gold mine in Peru, in South America. Actually, it is the second largest gold mine in the world. 
   I genuflect before those mine workers because here is what they have been told. Though the company has doubled its dividends to its shareholders, they won't give the workers anything. That is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. Do you think they care? They are cleaning up on Wall Street selling that gold. Go to New York. Watch how that happens. Will they help those workers? No. What the company has told them, what the government has told them, the government said, Go back to work or you lose your job in 3 days. You are fired. 
   That is who we are doing business with, my friends? 
   I am an old-line Democrat. I came here to represent the majority of people in this country who are being dispossessed by Wall Street, dispossessed by the global corporations that think they are worth nothing. And we had best have a majority of a majority here tomorrow stand for the workers of this continent who still believe that we are the beacon of freedom and that they matter. 
   God bless this country, and God bless our workers.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and rise in opposition to the rule, which should be open. 
   Every time we sign a free trade agreement with a developing country, we end up outsourcing more wealth and middle-class jobs. If these agreements were working, America wouldn't have an $800 billion trade deficit, with 20,000 jobs lost for every billion dollars of that deficit. What an unprecedented wipe out of jobs and productive wealth in this country. The sliding value of the dollar proves it, our staggering debt levels prove it, and the growing stock market instability proves it. 
   Let me give you some history. When they said we had to pass NAFTA back in the 1990s, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. Since NAFTA's unfortunate passage, every single year we have fallen into greater and greater debt with Mexico. A million of our jobs are outsourced. We didn't create a million jobs. And 2 million Mexicans were thrown off their farms and created an unending flow of illegal immigration to this country. 
   Then they told us, well, sign China PNTR; that will make a big difference. We were already in debt with China when PNTR was signed, and guess what? It only got worse. We have an historic trade deficit with China now, and we're getting from them contaminated dog food and toys with lead and all of the rest. And now they tell us, well, Peru is next. We've already got a trade deficit with Peru. Del Monte and Green Giant have opened up production facilities in Peru to absorb some of the 2 million Peruvian farmers that are going to be upended by this agreement, just as what happened with Mexico's campesinos under NAFTA. 
   Jordan, they said, was a breakthrough agreement, had environmental provisions, labor provisions; So, what's happened, even the Jordanians admit, it's not enforced. 
   You know, in considering another free trade agreement today, this New Direction Congress offers up more of the same, again, out of step with the American people. 
   The environmental and labor provisions are nonbinding; they're in the general preamble. This is like saying you support the preamble to our Constitution but not the Bill of Rights and all the case law that supports it. That's why no labor unions are supporting this in the United States or Peru. In fact, a major Peru miners' union is on strike right now, and they were told by the Government of Peru today that the strike was illegal and said if the workers don't return to work, they will be terminated in 3 days. 
   So I ask, why are no U.S. or Peruvian trade unions supporting the agreement? 
   Could it be because the agreement does not require the Parties to comply with core labor ``rights'', but rather with vague and unenforceable labor ``principles, which are then cleverly placed in the Preamble or Declaration of the agreement, not in the enforceable and binding core standards as do the International Labor Organization Convention?  
   Oh, let us grow up. 
   So, I have a better idea. Rather than pass another so called ``free trade'' agreement with another foreign country, that has weak rule of law and masses of poor people, let's negotiate a free trade agreement with ourselves! That would be a first. For Congress to pay some attention to the American people. 
   A free trade agreement with the U.S. might result in jobs from other places being returned here to workers who have fallen out of the middle class. 
   It might mean we would again be a nation that produced something rather than just traded in foreign goods. 
   Can you imagine--America might again make televisions, electronics, shoes, clothing, washing machines and irons, windshield wipers, electric wiring harnesses, toys, crayons, dishes, forks and spoons, well, the list is endless. Imagine if we had a trade agreement that put our workers and communities first. Now there's a novel thought. 
   Imagine, if the diminishing middle class believed this Congress actually represented them. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this Peru agreement and finally begin to develop a new trade model that results in job creation in America and balanced global trade accounts. When that happens, America's middle class will again begin to grow.

Coming from the Midwestern part of the country, we literally have had Mexican trucks end up in our region, how, we don't know, where the driver was actually moving the steering wheel with a vise grip. Now, how does that get to the State of Ohio all the way from the border with Mexico? Something is really broken in the system already. We should not expand anything. We should fix the problem that we have today. 
   Let me tell you, the sheriffs in Ohio along the turnpike and all of our surface roads are busy dealing with traffic that shouldn't be there in the first place. A lot of those vehicles are carrying illegal narcotics into our region. That border is a sieve. We ought to take care of it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment and commend him for offering it here today.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding and in support of the Hunter-Kaptur amendment. It is a simple limitation amendment. And frankly, one of the chief reasons I'm supporting it, in addition to all the excellent reasons Mr. Hunter has given, is that the administration refuses to report back to Congress its negotiation on this Security and Prosperity Partnership and its impact in a number of areas, including transportation. They have been intransigent, they have been unresponsive and, frankly, they've been secretive. And this is going to have an enormous impact on public welfare across this continent, particularly in our country. 
   The gentleman talks about security. I support him in that. Right now we've got a situation under NAFTA where so many of our jobs and production platforms have been outsourced to Mexico. We've got all these illegal trucks coming in. They're even making their way all the way to Ohio, up into Detroit, causing us all kinds of difficulty. We need transparency and we need disclosure about what the Security and Prosperity Partnership is all about. The Administration, even on our request, refuses to answer inquiries about the SPP. 
   Due to NAFTA, we just have tremendous problems with additional illegal drugs in our area coming in transported in a lot of these vehicles that are coming from the border, and in many ways we already have an unregulated flow across our continent. 
   So I really support the gentleman's efforts here. We need transparency. We need disclosure. We don't need to expand the difficulties we're already having as a result of what has transpired with NAFTA. And with the size of the roadways that are being talked about, and the possibility they will be privatized tollways, we need to have reporting back from this administration. 
   So I support the gentleman's amendment very strongly.

I know how hard Congressman Jim McDermott has worked on this legislation. And I have to say I come to the microphone with a heavy heart, because I obviously did not support the $870 billion for Wall Street, and now we come with $6 billion, 6 precious billion dollars that these people earned and sent into the tax coffers of this country. And we are going to give it back to them as a gift? 
   I am getting tired as a Democrat of picking up the wreckage across America. When is my party really going to stand up to Wall Street and the outsourcing of jobs? This isn't good enough. This isn't good enough for the people who have sent us here. They have earned it. Those people at Treasury didn't earn it. Wall Street didn't earn it. They squandered our money. 
   So today, because of Congressman McDermott's leadership, at least we have a lifeline to the people who are paying the tax dollars. They are going to be rerouted to Wall Street and then they are going to send half of it abroad.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, Mr. Chairman, and dear colleagues, do you feel like a herd of bulls and bears are rushing at you? They are. The question is will you stand up to them? 
   This approach, their approach, will not work. It won't solve the credit crunch nor the mortgage foreclosure challenge. 
   Wall Street speculators, now the major donors in Federal campaigns, have used their considerable influence inside the halls of government, especially at the U.S. Treasury, to open up the piggy bank. Meanwhile, taxpayers across Main Street, who will pay the bill, will find it has no effect on bettering their lives as unemployment increases, foreclosures increase, and the squeeze on the middle class increases. The Treasury plan throws an ungodly amount at Wall Street. Yet all of our Congressional committees but for one were relieved of their duties as regular order was dispensed with for a very hasty action. 
   We should do what we did back in the '70s, '80s and '90s and use the powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the credit crunch without costing the taxpayers a penny. This bill is just an end run around the American people 3 weeks before an election while this Congress is skittish and as Wall Street's investment houses conduct their biggest heist of the century from the U.S. Treasury and our U.S. taxpayers. 
   Pray for our Republic. She is being placed in uncaring and very greedy hands.

   My colleagues, a vote to reject this bill is not a vote to do nothing. I will vote ``no'' on the rule and on the bill because I want to vote to do something that really works. My ``no'' vote will be a call to not reward speculators, but first to bring in the regulators to do their job.  
   We should be using the regulatory powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the accounting powers of the Security and Exchange Commission to unseize credit lines to our banks. That is at the heart of the problem that we are facing. Let's do that first. 
   I would urge the leadership of this House to put a sense of Congress resolution attached to this agreement that does exactly that. Let us do that first. Let's wait a week. Let's see what happens. Let's see if those actions defuse the tension in the credit markets. 
   We must craft an alternative that will also provide help to our home owners facing foreclosure now. How can we reward Wall Street, who made bad decisions, but yet allow millions of our people to be thrown out of their homes by the first of the year? 
   Let's work on a bill that doesn't reward bad behavior but corrects the real problems inside this marketplace.  
   Let's unleash the power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission to use their authorities to unseize credit flows and mark mortgages to the true economic value of the assets. This will not cost the taxpayers a cent. It will restore rigor to the markets and use the market, as was done in the 1970's and 1980's successfully, to resolve troubled banks suffering under the weight of real estate foreclosures.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, when our Nation was founded, its spirit of independence and liberty permeated its creation. Freedom, independence, and liberty are the core of the American spirit. But I fear that our priceless heritage is at risk as our Nation loses its way. We are $10 trillion in debt, dependent more and more on foreign borrowing every day to conduct wars not being paid for. We are energy dependent, not independent. We are dependent on foreign petroleum, 75 percent of which we import from foreign countries across the rest of the world. Most of those places are undemocratic regimes. We are dependent on that petroleum. We are dependent on importing capital because we are $10 trillion in debt. Now we have the highest home foreclosure rate since the Great Depression. 
   The State that I represent, Ohio, which has lost so many jobs through outsourcing to foreign countries, is hard hit, as is our sister State north of us, the State of Michigan. Why? These are all the result of Wall Street draining people's accumulated equity from their largest form of savings, their home. When you have that amount of debt, you have to monetize it. You have to cover the gap. So what do you do? You send letters to the American people. The big banks are saying, ``Do you want to borrow against your home equity? Do you want to borrow $20,000 or $30,000 or $40,000?'' That happened across our country, and now many people are living in homes where they owe more on their mortgage than the basic value of the home itself. 
   We are losing our independence. Families are losing their independence. In turn, the Nation is losing its independence. At some point, you might say, the chickens of profligacy have come home to roost. 
   We witness parts of our Nation being pawned off every day. We see turnpikes that the States used to own and run being rented out to foreign countries for 99 years, and then the taxpayers of those States having to pay for them again with interest over 99 years. And the debt never ends. 
   The latest fire sale, as was reported in the New York Times yesterday, is NASDAQ, one of the pillars of our stock market. The New York Times reported that an undemocratic country, the United Arab Emirates, which is a Middle Eastern fiefdom, intends to buy one-third of the NASDAQ. That is incredible. 
   Let me ask, why would we sell any part of the heart of our economy to a foreign government or any undemocratic interest? Why we would do this, unless we were broke. And we are broke. We are only holding it together with borrowing. If our government tried to buy one-third of the NASDAQ, I could just hear the voices in here saying, ``socialism, socialism.'' It wouldn't be allowed. We would stop it. Why would we allow any foreign government or any foreign interest to purchase one-third of one of our pillars of capitalism in this country? The United Arab Emirates is notorious for human trafficking, for money laundering, including from terrorist networks. And we are going to allow them to buy one-third of the NASDAQ? 
   The United Arab Emirates is a hub in the Middle East for recirculating petrodollars that are taken out of our pockets because we are energy dependent here at home rather than energy independent. Those countries have amassed billions and billions and billions of dollars to fuel their undemocratic oil dictatorships. The UAE has no democratic government, no democratically elected government. Its citizens have no right to freely change their government. We have laws that tell us how often we have to change our Government. There is no freedom of representation in the United Arab Emirates. Why would we allow them to buy one-third of our stock market? 
   Mr. Speaker, I intend to introduce legislation to block this latest sellout of America.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would very much like to thank the dean of the Republican delegation from Ohio, Congressman Ralph Regula, a dear friend, for helping to organize this very special moment tonight in honor of our friend and colleague from Ohio, Representative Paul Gillmor, who last evening succumbed to a call that will greet us all. We never know the time nor the hour. 
   I understand that Paul flew back to Washington yesterday with several of his colleagues. And sometimes we wonder why things happen the way they do, but he was able to speak with several of them upon his return to Washington after having spent most of August with his family in Ohio. That itself is a gift. 
   It is with shock and sadness that we on this side of the aisle extend heartfelt sympathy to the Gillmor family. To his wife, Karen, I can't tell you how many White House Christmas parties I recall sharing with her, our travels to Mexico long before the passage of NAFTA as we evaluated the situation on the ground. Those are memories that I will hold forever. 
   To the five Gillmor children, Paul was a very, very dedicated father. I recall one time I was going into Channel 11, our CBS affiliate, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this, the other affiliates won't be mentioned, even though it didn't happen in their stations, and Paul had one of his sons with him that day, and he was so polite. And we were talking about where he was going to school. Paul tried to be with his family, especially with his younger children, as much as he could. 
   He suffered great tragedy in his own life, serving in Vietnam as a Captain in the Air Force in that very troubled conflict. I'm sure that he carried memories and wounds from that. And then having lost his first wife in a tragic automobile accident, having to survive that and continue to serve. 
   He dedicated his life to public service. Many people I don't think realize what a wealthy man he was. He didn't have to be here in the Congress. He could have checked out long ago. But in the tradition of service that his family represented and very deep, deep roots in Buckeye land in Ohio, he served his country not just in the Air Force, but in the Ohio Senate where he was the majority leader, and finally, the people of the Fifth Congressional District in this House since 1989, a decade and a half. 
   There are many pieces of legislation for which he exhibited leadership. One of those dealt with brownfields, a problem well known in a State like Ohio, and trying to move legislation in order to convert those over for reuse. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee Chair during a portion of his career, he made a real national contribution there. 
   Together, we worked on saving the 180th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the Army Air National Guard in our districts. When gerrymandering occurred a few years ago and the districts were redrawn, literally, he ended up with one half of the airport and I ended up with the other half. And I thought, oh, this is interesting. So we were very successful in our efforts there. And without question, that particular unit, which will be returning to Ohio this week, is returning to a facility that he helped to save. One of my memories is that before their departure about four months ago, Paul and I were there together wishing every single one of the members of that unit Godspeed and a quick return to our country. 
   There were many times that we spent together in our region of the State. Just last week, Paul and I appeared in Findlay, Ohio as a result of the tragic 1,000-year flooding that occurred up in our area. Congressman Jim Jordan was there as well from Urbana, Ohio. And then Paul and I met with Secretary Chertoff. We were planning meetings here upon our return here this week. And we talked about the need for FEMA to be more responsive to the needs of this region. And we then took an Apache helicopter with General Wayt from the Ohio National Guard and we flew over to Bucyrus, just the two of us together in that helicopter. And we were pointing out different reservoirs and different dams and different things that had to be done in order to prevent this type of tragedy again. And we met with the mayor of Bucyrus and with the county commissioners there and the emergency management officials. We had quite a visit. And then Paul and I got back on the Apache helicopter and we flew back to Findlay, Ohio where his sister was waiting for him at the airport. And they were on to the next stop. I think he was headed over to Ottawa, Ohio in his district, which had also been very, very badly flooded. 
   I see Congressman Jordan over there. I never knew that when we were in Findlay, Ohio together, we kind of grabbed hands and tried to deal with the flooding in your district as well, that that would be the last time that we would do that together. 
   So we had many memories that we share of Paul's service. And I offer the consolation and the condolences of the people from the Ninth Congressional District, which literally wraps its arms around the northern part of Paul's district, to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues, and to say we are there in dutiful service to do what is necessary to transition in these very difficult days and months ahead. 
   I want to say personally to Karen, his wife, that I value our friendship. And many of us who have reached the age we are know what a loss this is, and we are praying for you, we are praying for your children, we are praying for your family. 
   I wanted to extend the opportunity for our dear colleague from Tennessee, Congressman John Tanner, who is down here on the floor, who wanted to offer words on behalf of Paul Gillmor whatever time he wishes to consume. I yield him such time.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICAN PATENT LAW -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would thank the fine gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) for securing the special order time this evening and join him in his special order concerning the patent bill that will be coming up later in the week. 
   I share his concern that this bill is not reform, and with what is happening across our country with the outsourcing of jobs, now is not the time to weaken U.S. patent protection, which is a constitutional protection going back to the founding of our Republic. 
   Congressman Rohrabacher has gone through a lot of the technicalities of what is involved in this bill that is coming before us. Let me just say that there was a magazine article published back in June by Manufacturing and Technology News in their June 29, 2007 issue. Viewers can go to www.manufacturingnews.com and pick it up. It was written by Dr. Pat Choate. What I find particularly compelling about this article is it gets into who actually is driving this bill and why is this bill coming at us, a bill that will weaken protections for U.S. inventors, or those that file in our country, at a time when we were hemorrhaging jobs, certainly in the manufacturing sector, but not just that sector, and at a time when our trade deficit is now close to $1 trillion a year, a time when our budget deficit and our trade deficit is so high that the Federal Reserve a week ago had to resort to creating money, printing money and shoving it into our financial system to try to prop it up. 
   What is happening? Why would this bill be coming up now? We know that the forces that are driving this bill are very large corporations, transnational corporations, the very ones that are moving our jobs offshore. And what they are about is that sometimes those very big companies get sued because they infringe on other people's patents. They then go to court and lose, and they are forced to pay fines. In response, because they don't like that, they are financing an expensive lobbying propaganda and legal campaign to weaken our patent laws. 
   They are using the wrong measure. What they should do is stop infringing on other people's patents and not try to change the whole patent system as a solution to their predicament. Let me just place a number on the record that is quoted in this article. And I don't know that the gentleman has done this yet this evening, but between 1993 and 2005, four of these big companies paid out more than $3.5 billion in patent settlements. But in the same period, their earnings were more than $1.4 trillion, making their patent settlements only about one-quarter of 1 percent of their revenues. Now they wish to reduce even those costs, not by changing their obviously unfair and often illegal business practices, but by persuading Congress and also the Supreme Court to weaken U.S. patent protections which have been guaranteed since the founding of the Republic. They have tried to convince Congress that there is some type of litigation crisis. As the gentleman has just properly outlined, there is no litigation crisis in the courts relating to patents.

   Ms. KAPTUR. We know how much they have been taking in other ways, taking health benefits away from our people, taking good wages away from our people, literally taking jobs and transporting them someplace else. And our patent system has been at the basis of the creativity of this country. It is a great, great system 
   By the way, I will say for the record, there is a website one can go to, www.uscourts.gov/caseload2006. contents.html. And on that site, you can look at these various cases to see that the courts aren't overloaded. The courts aren't saying they are overloaded in terms of suits relating to patents. But one of the parts of the bill that truly, truly concerns me, and why I shall vote against it, is that these very large transnational corporations want to change the longstanding practice of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of granting a patent to the person who actually invented it. We call it ``first to invent.'' They want to change it to ``first to file.'' In other words, if they get the system they want, which means that an inventor takes their brilliant idea to the Patent and Trademark Office, even before it is approved, it has to be posted on a Web site, and somebody in China or somebody in Tokyo can take that, file it in their country, and they say, ``grant the patent to the first to file.'' Not the first to invent. 
   We protect individuals in this country. We protect that intellectual capital. To even suggest that we should go to a system that the gentleman has said that exists in Europe, for example, that is not the American system. Before the American system of economics got captured by these globalists who are controlling Wall Street and some of these big decisions that are hollowing out communities across this country, we had a country that respected the Constitution and the right of the inventor. You. The person who actually created the idea, whether you are a musician, whether you are an electronics expert, whether you are an automotive expert, whether you make a decent paper towel hanger for your kitchen, if you have a better idea, our legal system protects you against the large companies and the small.

   Ms. KAPTUR. If the gentleman would be kind enough to yield to me again, it would force our inventors to defend themselves in a way that they don't have to today to go through all these additional bureaucratic hurdles, because under the current system we protect your idea, we protect your right as an inventor, no matter how small you are. 
   In fact, if you look at the patents filed every day, which I look at as the seed capital of the future of this economy, a third of those patent applications are from very small inventors. They are from universities. We see every day major counterfeiters around the world taking our ideas and doing knockoffs. They actually come to your district, Congressman Rohrabacher, before they come to mine, because you have got that port down there in Southern California. 
   But we know how counterfeiting occurs and what the potential is in other places to cheat, and we have protections for our people against that.

   Ms. KAPTUR. It would seem to me that at this point in our country we would be wanting to encourage innovation here in the United States. We want to be rewarding those people who are creating the future, whether it is in agriculture, whether it is in transportation, whether it is in medical care. 
   We have all seen the companies in our district where jobs are growing, and they begin with invention, they begin with creativity guaranteed by our Constitution. Why would we make it more difficult for them in the courts? Why would we make it easier for those who want to take their idea or get a sneak preview of their idea before their patent is granted? Why would we want to give them greater advantage in this struggle for jobs in America? It is beyond me. But I understand power and I understand the power of these companies.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Yes. And you know at this time in this country, where it is hard to find a good paying job, it is really very hard, some of these companies that are trying to weaken our patent system actually pay their staffs less than companies that are in communities like I represent, where people earn a living wage. 
   These companies also outsource a lot of jobs related to component manufacture and so forth. I find it interesting that they have so much power and they have so much influence that now they are trying to, in a way, take away the potential for districts like mine to reinvent themselves by protecting those who are creating new ideas. In fact, they want to get rid of this opt-out provision, where if you are a small inventor and you file as first-to-invent at the Patent Office, you have a choice whether you want foreign entities to be able to see that invention now. They have this opt-out provision, where you protect yourself before you are able to get the approval and try to get the money to manufacture or provide the service that you want to provide. 
   This will make it very difficult. About half of the inventions that we have come from small businesses, universities and independent inventors who select that opt-out provision.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Absolutely. I don't think the average American understands how hard it is to get the money to start up your company. Once you have filed and gotten the patent itself, it is not easy if you are a small 
   inventor. Why would you want to reveal that abroad?

   Ms. KAPTUR. As a member of the Defense Subcommittee, the gentleman might be surprised to learn that today I spent part of my day learning that the U.S. Department of Defense main contract for procurement of tires for our vehicles, defense vehicles, is from a foreign company. And we have very few tire manufacturers left in the United States of America. 
   I couldn't believe it. The company that is favored, Michelin, is building a facility in China to manufacture tires. I thought, wait a minute. What about Akron, Ohio? What about North Carolina? What about Kansas? What about other places where we make tires in this country? How is it possible that the Department of Defense signs a contract for tires with a foreign company? I have got nothing against Michelin, but what about American jobs and technology?

   Ms. KAPTUR. I share the gentleman's value of free trade among free people, and I also believe it should be a two-way street. So when the United States has a trade imbalance with any country of over $10 billion each of three consecutive years, I think we should go back and see what is wrong with that agreement. I think it ought to be assessed by the administration. I think we should find out what is going wrong. 
   We are not doing that anywhere on the globe. Whether it is China or whether it is Mexico, we are falling into deeper and deeper debt. 
   I think the measure is a real measure, not just political, but also the bottom line. Are we winning or losing in that trade relationship? If we are losing in that trade relationship, we ought to fix it.

   Ms. KAPTUR. The gentleman was talking about the cheating that is done by many companies globally, and one of the reasons I don't care for the bill that is going to be brought before us is right now there are at least 15 different factors that a court can weigh in assessing fines on companies that cheat, that infringe on someone else's patent. What happens under this bill is these 15 factors that the courts like because it helps them make a judgment in whatever the particulars of the case might be, are reduced to one and the other 14 factors don't really have to be weighed. So there is a significant change in this legislation that would heavily impact on what the courts can do and how they look at a given case.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to inform the House that in addition to the loss of Ohio's beloved colleague PAUL GILLMOR today and former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn, we have lost a beloved friend and indefatigable colleague when Ohio Congressman Charles Vanik passed away last week at the age of 94. 
   I know that Congressman Regula and I, along with all of our delegation, feel this loss as deeply as we feel the others. I wanted to just mention to our colleagues that Congressman Vanik served from 1955 until 1981 and was affectionately known as Ohio's third Senator. 
   He is probably most remembered for his landmark legislation, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, that continues to connect U.S. trade policy to human rights. We in Ohio will always remember him as a true champion and leader on Medicare, Social Security and the plight of the poorest Americans. 
   I would like to yield to my colleague, my beloved friend, Ralph Regula, now for some words.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding and congratulate Congressman Ackerman on this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support today on the anniversary of 9/11, 2001, and to pay tribute to the over 3,000 Americans who lost their lives in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. 
   Let me remember that day through the life of one man, a retired air traffic controller, Mr. John Werth, a constituent who was on duty that day at the Major Air Control Center located in Oberlin, Ohio, in our Ninth Congressional District of Ohio. His professionalism and attention to duty that terrible day saved hundreds, literally thousands of lives, though in the end he was not able to prevent the crash of United flight 93, which went down over Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and in which 40 of the lives lost that day remain forever in our memory. 
   In today's issue of USA Today, which I shall include in the Record, Mr. Werth's photo and story appear on the front page. It is appropriate that after all these years some of the heroic stories of that day become more fully available to the public. Mr. Werth's clearheaded efforts, under great pressure and amid great national confusion, diverted aircraft away from the highjacked plane, saving lives. As professional air traffic controllers in the employ of the Government of the United States, he and his colleagues worked hand in hand with our military to do the best they could under the most trying of circumstances. His three decades of experience served America well and cannot be overstated. He, and I know his colleagues across our Nation, acted with courage and dispatch. And we all respect them deeply. They carry with them in their memories of that day the transmissions from those cockpits. There is no question he and his colleagues literally saved thousands of lives by safely landing thousands of flights across this country. They avoided midair collisions and, for their grace under pressure, deserve every recognition and medal of honor the American people can bestow. They hold our admiration, they hold our gratitude, and they hold our respect for their patriotism and attention to duty. We are forever indebted to them.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman very much. 
   On behalf of the American people and certainly the citizens of Ohio who remain extremely proud of John Werth and his colleagues and his air controller associates across our country, please let the record show we extend our abiding thanks on this historic day. We extend our deep remembrances to the families and communities still affected. And we ask God to bless America and help us lead the world to a more peaceful day.  
   7 Years Later, the Terror Is Still Vivid  
   OBERLIN, OHIO--He spent most of his life controlling airplanes. But on this day seven years ago, United Flight 93 was beyond control. 
   Cleveland Center air-traffic controller John Werth had never heard anything like it--the sounds of an animalistic struggle crackling over his radio. He heard screaming, hollering and two guttural groans coming from the cockpit. 
   The horror of one of the four 9/11 suicide hijackings was playing out, Werth tells USA Today in his first public recounting of the day that forever changed America. 
   ``I lost 40 people that day,'' Werth says of the desperate efforts he and his colleagues made to communicate with Flight 93 and keep other planes away from it until the jet crashed in a rural Pennsylvania field. 
   Today, the story of that flight is well known--in books, movies and tales of heroism about the passengers who tried to retake the jet from four al-Qaeda terrorists, and probably prevented an attack on the White House or U.S. Capitol. For Werth, it's been a vivid--if largely private--reality. He was there. He heard it all. 
   Werth's account provides new details about what happened as the hijacking unfolded and how the chaos in the skies caused alarm and confusion for controllers and national security forces. 
   For seven years, Werth, 61, hasn't told his story publicly, initially because he was not allowed to because of a government subpoena related to the prosecution of al-Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui, and later because Werth didn't want the attention. Now, Werth's ready to discuss it and set the record straight. 
   It was Werth who heard the transmission from Flight 93 that suggested a bomb was aboard. The transmission, in a thick accent and broken English, likely was from hijacker pilot Ziad Jarrah, the 9/11 Commission determined later. 
   The bomb was apparently a bluff, a threat the hijackers used to try to control the passengers. 
   At the time, Werth says, it created a new level of alarm among the controllers clearing other planes out of the wayward path of Flight 93, which had departed from Newark, N.J., that morning and flown into Ohio before making a U-turn toward Washington. 
   What if, Werth wondered, the hijackers had a bomb--maybe even a nuclear device? How far would Werth have to keep other jets from a nuclear bomb's shock wave? Twenty miles? Thirty? 
   Every time Werth turned other planes away from Flight 93, the hijacked jet seemed to surge toward them, he recalls, raising questions about what the hijackers were trying to do. At the time, he knew that some passenger jets were missing and that one had hit a World Trade Center tower in New York. 
   ``I'm saying, `What is he doing?' '' Werth recalls. `` `Is this about a midair collision.' '' an attempt to ram another passenger jet with Flight 93? 
   All the while, uncertainty gripped the nation--and Cleveland Center, which oversees a wide swath of the nation's skies between Chicago and New York. 
   ``SOMETHING WAS REALLY OFF''
   That morning began routinely for Werth as he sat in front of his radar screen and radio, surrounded by maps and computers. Soon, the news began trickling down to him. 
   Two jets were ``lost'' over New York. Someone said a small plane (actually a jet, it turned out) had hit the World Trade Center in New York. A supervisor told him to try to contact American Airlines Flight 77, which had gone missing over Kentucky. 
   ``That's when I knew something was really off,'' he says. 
   He was also told to keep an eye on Delta Air Lines Flight 1989, which had taken off from Boston. Amid the confusion, controllers in Boston worried it was connected to the jets missing in New York. Those jets, American Airlines Flight 11 and United 175, also had departed from Boston. 
   Finally came word that a second plane, a large jet, had hit New York's twin towers. 
   The pilots of Flight 93, headed west to San Francisco from Newark, arrived at 9:24 a.m. in Werth's control sector, a roughly 100-by-100-mile patch in the Cleveland area that handles only high-altitude traffic. The Boeing 757 carried seven crewmembers and 37 passengers, including the four hijackers. Within four minutes of arriving in Werth's sector, according to the 9/11 Commission Report and other government documents, the hijackers had launched a violent takeover of the jet. 
   During the struggle, one of the pilots tried to make a distress call or inadvertently switched on the radio's microphone, allowing Werth and other planes in the area to overhear what was happening aboard Flight 93. 
   Werth says most of the sounds of the struggle were unintelligible. There were screams and groans. Werth recalls turning to another controller. ``I looked at him and said, `Dave, did that sound the same to you as it did to me?' He just kind of looked at me wide-eyed and nodded.'' 
   He knew another flight was probably under attach, but which one? ``Somebody call Cleveland?'' he radioed. No one replied.  
   Thirty-three seconds later came a second broadcast from the cockpit. It also had the sounds of a struggle, but this time Werth made out a few words: ``Get out of here. Get out of here.'' 
   About that time, Flight 93 descended about 700 feet. By then, Werth was pretty sure the flight had been hijacked. What were the hijackers up to? Why do they want to be over Cleveland? Why are they this far west? I thought at first, well, you've got the Sears Tower (in Chicago) straight west,'' he says. 
   There were no procedures or training exercises for such an emergency, Werth says, so he made it up as he went along. He asked other crews whether they had heard the scuffle over the radio. When they replied, he knew they were still OK. 
   The hijacked jet became erratic. It sped up and started gaining on another United flight. Werth commanded the second jet to turn right. Seconds later, Fight 93 turned to the right, too. 
    Minutes later, as Flight 93 climbed from 35,000 to 41,000 feet, Werth told Delta Fight 1989 to turn right to clear it away from the hijacked jet. Then Flight 93 made a 180-degree turn back toward the east, forcing Werth to move the Delta flight back out of the way. ``Delta 89, we're gonna go the other way,'' he radioed. 
   As Flight 93 passed over Akron, headed by that time in the direction of Washington, Werth heard a supervisor call out that a jet had just struck the Pentagon. 
   ``IT'S THE DELTA!''
   Before United 93 had even checked in with Werth, a supervisor had asked him to watch Delta 1989, a westbound flight from Boston to Los Angeles. It was 60 miles east of his sector, flying behind the United jet. 
   Werth has never been sure who called the facility to warn about the flight or why, and other accounts have been murky. The flight was a Boeing 767 like two other hijacked flights out of Boston. It would have been logical to suspect that it, too, might have been a target. 
   As Werth struggled to keep other jets away from United 93, he had to turn the Delta flight several times. The pilots responded normally. He couldn't be sure of anything that day, but it seemed a safe bet that the Delta flight hadn't been hijacked. 
   However, someone in the military seemed to have mixed up the Delta flight with the hijacked jet. A supervisor rushed up to Werth and said, ``It's the Delta, it's the Delta!'' Werth recalls. She told him that a military liaison on the phone had confirmed that the Delta jet was hijacked. 
   Werth told her he was pretty sure United 93 had been hijacked, not the Delta one. A few moments later, she came back. 
   ``He's fine--at least for now,'' Werth told her. 
   After consulting again on the phone, she returned again. ``They said it's a confirmed hijack and a bomb threat,'' she told him. It was United 93 that had made the bomb threats, Werth thought. That convinced him they had to be confusing the two flights. 
   ``Tell them they're full of it!'' Werth says he replied. ``I thought, `God, don't (have military jets that were being scrambled) go after the wrong plane.' '' 
   At 9:44 a.m., the Delta pilots requested a change of course from Werth. The same concerns about their safety had been passed on to the company, and dispatchers had ordered it to land as soon as possible in Cleveland. 
   As it turned out, the military was in no position to shoot down Delta 1989, but Werth didn't know that. He followed the flight on radar until it landed safely. 
   Fight 93 didn't make another radio transmission after 9:39 a.m.Werth watched on radar as the jet crashed near Shanksville, Pa., at 10:03.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (SURGING GASOLINE PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, surging gas prices at the pump surely tell us, just before Memorial Day, that something has gone wrong again with the rigged oil markets. 
   We've seen gasoline prices in our country set all-time highs. Ohio families are paying $3.50 to $3.93 a gallon, with no end in sight. And when President Bush took office, they were paying $1.46 a gallon. In fact, when Vice President Cheney was sworn in, Halliburton's stock was worth one-fourth of what it's worth today. 
   So we think about America's families and our consumers. They're being hurt. Car and truck sales are being hurt. Our economy is being hurt. It's all so unnecessary. 
   When you fuel up, the chances are 7 out of 10 that the crude oil for the gasoline came from an undemocratic foreign country, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, Angola, Mexico, maybe even trafficked out of Iraq, places that do not exactly love thriving democracy. 
   Meanwhile, in oil-rich Iraq, this week, eight more American soldiers were killed in roadside bomb attacks near Baghdad. And this brings to nearly 3,400 U.S. service-member deaths in Iraq, plus additional Department of Defense civilian employees, and the death toll keeps mounting. 
   The major oil pipeline and refinery in Iraq is now being guarded by our best, the 82nd Airborne, and sundry private contractors. They're guarding oil lines and the refinery. In fact, some of that oil has been stolen and even trafficked throughout the war. 
   Meanwhile, a new hydrocarbon law is being pushed in Iraq, which boasts the second largest oil reserves in the world, that would privatize the majority of oil in that country to who? That's the trillion-dollar question. That's the $23 trillion question. 
   How disgusting to me that our finest military have to die in an oil war. When will the American people begin to connect undemocratic oil regimes, imported oil, and the lives of our sons and daughters while our gasoline-consuming public is subjected here to the oil marketeers? 
   I don't think anybody would admit it is a free market in oil. It's a cartelized market. It has been for half a century. 
   Exxon and the other major oil companies are raking in historic profits at the expense of our sons and daughters. We see U.S. military power fully projected in Kuwait, in Iraq, benefiting their neighbors, too, like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, who have had to hire growing legions of private security firms to hold up their kingdoms and emirates. Saudi Aramco is the largest privately held company in the world, and Exxon Aramco the most profitable oil company in history. Are you starting to see the picture? 
   Let me ask a critical question: Would any of the oil profits made off the pocketbooks of Americans be going to hire more security guards in Saudi Arabia, or in Bahrain, or in Kuwait? As Will Rogers would say, ``You betcha.'' 
   Our Nation's military power is now fully projected in the deserts over there, and here in Washington sits Congress and a President who say they want to break oil addiction from imported sources. But since President Bush took office, we are importing a billion more barrels a year, a billion more barrels a year every year since 2001. It is projected we will spend a trillion dollars on the war in Iraq, and it is not anywhere close to over. Yet we passed a bill out of the House a few months ago that just put a thimble full of additional resources in renewable energy. Is there any dispatch here? Is there any urgency? Is there any seriousness? Let the American people tell us. Do you see it? Do you hear it? Do you feel it in your pocketbooks? 
   Citizens are expressing their frustration with our inability to rein in the abuses of the oil companies. And I have got a partial solution. This week I am introducing a bill to give something back to the American people tired of being gouged by the oil companies. It is called the ``Give America Something Act of 2007,'' the GAS Act, G-A-S. Give every American a one-time immediate $100 gas payment refund. They can use it to pay for higher gas prices. They can use it to pay for higher transit costs. And we pay for it by imposing a windfall profits tax on oil revenue to provide the revenue to finance the program. This is long overdue.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman, and thank the esteemed chairman, for bringing this bill forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, the real answer to growing job loss in the United States, the declining value of our dollar and to rising trade deficits is to balance America's trade accounts by renegotiating failed deals like NAFTA and China PNTR, by not passing any more of them, by opening closed markets like Japan's and China's, and Korea's and by stopping unfair trade practices globally. 
   Meanwhile, our workers continue to take the big hits by losing their jobs and benefits. What this bill does is it gives them increased notice when their plants are going to close, and it also provides a landing pad in the form of training and trade adjustment assistance. I just wish that the jobs they are being trained for would be produced. We know that often is not the case. 
   This is the absolute least we can do for the people of our country. They have paid the price of our failure here in Washington to produce economic policies that make America's economy robust. 
   I fear, without our doing that, we are going to lose the industrial and defense prowess that made the United States the leader post-World War II. I just thank the committee for providing this bill which will help the casualties reposition a bit.  
   The real answer to growing U.S. job loss, the declining value of the dollar, and rising budget and trade deficits is to balance America's trade accounts by renegotiating failed deals like NAFTA and China PNTR and not pass more of them, by opening closed markets like Japan's, China's, and Korea's, and stopping unfair trade practices globally. 
   Meanwhile, our workers continue to take the big hits--they lose their jobs, they lose their benefits. 
   This bill gives them some help--by giving them increased notice before their plants are closed, and it revamps trade assistance and training to help them reposition if the jobs exist in the future. 
   We owe it to our workers and communities to give them a better chance to adjust. They are the casualties of economic policy here in Washington that is not working. This legislation will require employers to provide 90 days of notice in the event of a proposed plant closing or layoff. 
   Trigger the notification requirements if at least 25 workers lose their jobs during any 30-day period, not 50 workers as in current legislation; 
   Mandate notice if 100 or more workers are laid off at multiple plants or worksites during any 30-day period; 
   Cover both full-time and part-time hourly and salaried workers; 
   Require the Department of Labor to provide model educational information to employers on employer responsibilities and employee rights under WARN, as well as benefits and services available to dislocated workers; 
   Authorize the Department of Labor to investigate complaints and bring enforcement suits and also to notify Members of Congress who represent the affected areas; 
   Permit employees to recover back pay and benefits up to 90 days and also liquidated damages (doubling the compensation otherwise available) if an employer fails to give the required notice under the act; and, 
   Important to note is the legislation's extension of the period for COBRA (comprehensive benefits, including health care) coverage for recipients of trade adjustment assistance. Under current COBRA rules, workers who lose their jobs generally may continue their health benefits for up to 18 months at their own expense. The new legislation would give workers who are 55 years or older and have worked for an employer for 10 or more years the option to elect COBRA coverage until they become Medicare eligible at 65 or until they obtain health coverage through a subsequent employer. 
   While I support this bill, we must keep in mind that TAA and WARN aren't substitutes for jobs in manufacturing America. An America that does not produce not only loses the most vibrant wealth-producing sector of her economy but her defense and industrial base as well. 
   TAA and WARN should be used sparingly and for the short term--they are band-aids, not solutions. We need to pass legislation requiring the executive branch to balance our trade accounts, to renegotiate NAFTA/PNTR, and to open closed markets of the world. 
   It is no secret that we are voting on TAA today, to increase votes for the Peru Free Trade Agreement next week. Our willingness to sell out our Nation's workforce for the consolation prize of trade adjustment assistance promises to damage our country for decades to come. 
   I have two bills--H. Res. 336 and H.R. 169, the Balancing Trade Act, which will get our country back on the right track. By supporting H. Res. 336, we support fair, people-centered principles that promote free trade only among free peoples. The Balancing Trade Act, which already enjoys bipartisan support, demands that the President acknowledge a problem in our trade policy when our deficit with any one country exceeds $10 billion for more than 3 years. I also have a bill (H.R. 1958) to revoke PNTR from China, and I will be introducing a bill to require the President to renegotiate NAFTA. These bills are steps towards correcting our U.S. trade policy to prevent the kinds of layoffs and job loss that these bills merely ice over.   
   Tiffin Workers Discover Limits of WARN Act  
   TIFFIN.--Four days after Christmas in 2001, Gene Goshe braved the brisk cold as he walked to his newspaper box and unrolled his copy of the Tiffin Advertiser-Tribune. 
   ``National shutting down,'' blared the headline in tall letters across the front page. 
   In seconds, Mr. Goshe's life changed forever. 
   After devoting 33 years of his life to the National Machinery Co., Mr. Goshe read in the newspaper that morning that the plant had abruptly closed. He didn't get a phone call to let him know he no longer had a job. 
   ``It was like a snowball hit you in the hind end on the first of January,'' recalled Mr. Goshe, then 58. ``This is the way we are going to start the year.'' 
   The sudden demise of National Machinery stunned Tiffin, a town of 17,000 about 55 miles southeast of Toledo already reeling from plant closings and layoffs. 
   The plant, a few blocks from the small downtown, made the machines that made nuts and bolts since the 1880s. But while the products of its machines embodied the ordinary, the storied history of National Machinery was far from typical. 
   ``The National''--as locals affectionately called it--provided a choice working environment for generations in and around Seneca County, a flat, fertile part of northwest Ohio dotted with fields and woodlots. 
   The company's reputation as an exceptional employer was rooted in its traditions--a club for employees who had worked there at least 25 years, summer picnics at Cedar Point, and Christmas parties at the fancy Ritz Theatre. 
   National Machinery was like family, workers recalled. Not surprisingly, it was begun by Tiffin's first families--the Frosts and Kalnows, whose ownership dates to the 1880s, when patriarch Meshech Frost convinced the company's original owner to move its operations to Tiffin. 
   The Frosts, and later the Kalnows, are recognized as Tiffin's leading community boosters, using some of their vast fortune to support local causes and institutions, including the city's Heidelberg College, where the families set up scholarship programs to benefit the children of National Machinery employees.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CAMPAIGN SPENDING DOOMSDAY -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, for 60 years, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has operated the doomsday clock which measures the threat to civilization and counts the minutes under midnight. When it was first introduced in 1947, the doomsday clock measured only the nuclear threat. But now it takes climate change into account as well. 
   But perhaps we need a different doomsday clock, a clock that will warn us about a different type of arms race that also threatens the future of our Republic. This arms race is not nuclear weaponry but instead uncontrolled escalation in campaign spending. Unbridled campaign spending represents the clearest, most present danger to our democratic ideals as a Republic. 
   Here is the latest evidence. Just this week, the Center For Responsive Politics released the latest information about campaign spending in the 2008 presidential race. 
   After 9 months of fundraising, says the Center, ``This Presidential money chase seems to be on track to collect an unprecedented $1 billion total. By some predictions, the eventual nominees will need to raise $500 million  apiece to compete.'' $500 million apiece to compete. This is a tremendous amount of throw-weight, to borrow a Cold War term. 
   ``After nine months of fundraising, the candidates for President in 2008 have already raised about $420 million. This Presidential money chase seems to be on track to collect an unprecedented,'' and I repeat, ``$1 billion total''. That is probably four to five times as much as was collected just 4 years ago. On the Democratic side, HILLARY CLINTON has raised nearly $100 million. On the Republican side, Mitt Romney is about half that amount, but Rudy Giuliani is just on his tracks. BARACK OBAMA has raised about an equal amount to Senator Clinton. 
   The projected Presidential spending will exceed the annual gross domestic product of 25 nations on this planet. Where is all this money coming from? If the Presidential campaign surpasses the $1 billion mark for the first time in our history, who will own the next President? Isn't that what the American people are asking? Will it be middle-class voters, who are holding on for dear life, ordinary working folks trying to pay for gasoline, put food on the table, pay insurance bills, pay utility bills, pay tuition costs, pay taxes? Will they have more influence over the next President of the United States? Or will the big-money special interests have more influence? We all know the answer to that question. 
   The people are telling us they are deeply troubled. All the polls show the American people feel that Washington is totally out of step with them. It's hard to imagine a Presidential candidate who is not beholden to special interests. It's hard to imagine that a candidate who relies on hedge funds, multinationals and special interests will be able to stand up for the middle class in America. The middle class is asking where is the President, where is the Congress. 
   What type of legacy is this leaving for our children? Will they not conclude our Republic is owned lock, stock and barrel by the rich and powerful? It sure looks that way. What will they think our Nation, once founded with the high ideals of patriotism, sacrifice and rebellion against entrenched interests? What has happened to that Republic? 
   The dollar amounts being tossed around in the 2000 Presidential race make it only a matter time before another giant scandal rocks our government and further undermines the confidence in our body politic and our very system of government. We must curb this arms race now before it's too late. 
   H. Con. Res. 6, which I have introduced, reaffirms that presence of unlimited amounts of money is corrupting our political process in a fundamental manner. I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation and for Americans to pay attention and call this important issue to the attention of their representatives and of those Presidential candidates when they whiz through town. 
   America needs a new declaration of independence to take our politics back from the money handlers, the bundlers, the lobbyists, the spin doctors and the telemarketers, which is what Presidential campaigns have become, telemarketing, with $1 billion being put on television. 
   Let's return our Republic, if we can, to the American people and, more importantly, a free Republic to our children.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CONGRESS DID WHAT WAS RIGHT, NOT WHAT WAS FAST -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, in thanking my colleague, Congressman Gohmert, for all of his efforts to make this institution function in the manner that it was duly constituted to function, I was reminded today, as I was walking through the halls--not expecting the result that was just yielded on that important vote relating to Wall Street--there is a fresco downstairs, and above the door it has this quote, that ``Here there are no temples but the Capitol, and no oracle but the Constitution.'' 
   No matter how powerful any group is or any set of individuals, our duty is a different one, and that is, to work together across this aisle for the best legislation, the best law making that is humanly possible to serve the people that sent us here, through regular order. And that means hearing from the membership, especially on a matter of such extraordinary magnitude as we were just asked to vote upon. 
   This is the Congress of the United States, and we are a deliberative body. We are not a military order. There are no generals, and they are not able to command down the ranks. We operate through consensus. And when that process breaks down, we don't produce good legislation and, in turn, do not serve the American people. 
   On the matter that was before us, I think it's fair to say that most committees that should have met did not. They were discharged of their duties in a strange process that I hope I never see again. 
   The bill came to the floor with a closed rule. A few Members said to us after the vote, ``Well, where is your alternative? If you don't like this, where is your alternative?'' And our answer was, we had alternatives, but we were summarily denied the ability to present them through regular order. There was no reason to go to the Rules Committee, as it was a closed rule. We were not allowed to invite witnesses--and many of us asked, it's not like we didn't try. But let the record be very clear, Members were not able to testify, and therefore, we were not able to glean the best intelligence from our country as this bill moved forward. 
   ``There is no temple but the Capitol, and no oracle but the Constitution.'' I really believe this Congress met its duty, its sworn obligation today in this truly historic vote. We have a lot of work to do. And I think one thing happened today that is actually very good for the Republic, and that is, whatever artificial line may exist down that middle aisle, I think it crumbled, and  there is a new working energy inside this institution to do what should have been done in the first place. 
   Now, we have respect for our leadership, and we have respect for the President of the United States. And whatever was presented a few weeks ago that had to be acted upon with such urgency, we are willing to remain and to reconstitute ourselves and to exercise the duties of the office to which we have been elected as our constitution demands. 
   People don't have to be fearful, Wall Street doesn't have to be worried, we can take care of this. If we look to some of the institutions that have run up into a little trouble these last few weeks, we've seen what the FDIC has done. The insurance programs are working. Savings deposits are safe in our institutions. One can argue whether we should increase the FDIC-insured rate over $100,000 per depositor, but if we do this right, we can really give strength back to our credit markets because this is not a liquidity crisis, this is a credit crisis related to accounting standards. 
   We can hear from the best accountants in America. That should have been done. They could have helped us work through this; they were not given voice. We can take a look at the housing crisis, its foreclosure crisis--which is at the heart of the credit seize-up--because we have markets that aren't working there, we have a lot of empty properties, people being foreclosed. There was nothing in this legislation that would do workouts at the local level. Why didn't the Federal Reserve, you know, and the administration, they wanted all this money, but they didn't want money to help Main Street bankers and mortgage holders and families try to work out loans at the local level where we can save people in their homes. My goodness. 
   These are issues America has dealt with before. There should be calm across the country. The Congress has made a decision, and I believe that we will present a better bill in a very short period of time. 
   I thank you, Madam Speaker. And what a joy it was to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to do what was right, not what was fast.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the able Chairman BARNEY FRANK for yielding me this time, and say America needs the right deal, not a fast deal. 
   This Congress must step up to its constitutional responsibilities as a deliberative body to craft that right deal, not an insider trade. Actually, this bill is the wrong medicine. It concentrates financial power even more in the hands of Wall Street's mega banks and its buddies at the U.S. Treasury. 
   It bails out their bad behavior with no reform to prevent further abuse, and it ignores Main Street's real housing challenges. There is a much better way. The Bush administration says we are facing the worst financial crisis in modern history. That is not true. 
   The market problems of the 1980s were much worse than today. Then, over 3,000 banks failed, interest rates were 21 percent, and all the banks in Texas went down. The economic instability was resolved by the financial system in a much more disciplined and rigorous way than taxpayers printing money for Wall Street. 
   In those days the FDIC, not through a taxpayer bailout, but through careful use of FDIC's considerable power, resolved thousands of problem situations. No cash changed hands. The FDIC used its powers, its regular powers to regulate transactions with banks through a system of subordinated debentures and promissory notes. Even curbs on executive salaries and controlled dividends were exacted through that process. The cost of the entire enterprise was $1.8 billion, resolving over $100 billion in problem institutions from the FDIC insurance fund, paid for by the banks, not the taxpayers. 
   Today's economic challenge is a credit and housing crisis, not a liquidity crisis, precipitated by SEC accounting rules that are rewarding high-risk speculators and penalizing sound banks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I say we go back to the drawing board. This bill does not do it for the American people. Draft the right deal, not the fast deal. Draft the best deal.  
   Isaac: Banking Crisis? What Banking Crisis? 
   The former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., William M. Isaac, says the current turmoil in financial markets is not remotely comparable to the Great Depression. 
   He disputes even the notion of a crisis. 
   ``If there is a banking crisis, I have seen no evidence of it. I can count on my fingers and toes every sizeable bank about which I have had any concern during the past year,'' Isaac wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal. 
   By comparison, Isaac says, during the 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. suffered from 4,000 bank and savings and loan failures. There were still more than 1,430 banks on the FDIC's ``problem list'' by the end of 1991. 
   ``I'm sure the problem banks list will grow during the next year, but it totaled only 76 at last count,'' Isaac says. 
   ``Banks continue to have incredible access to the capital markets and over 99 percent of banks are considered well-capitalized by regulators.'' 
   Additionally, Isaac says, a 20 percent decline in housing prices was not really all that big of a deal economically for the U.S. 
   The widely cited S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index declined 14.4 percent in March from a year earlier. The gauge has fallen every month since January 2007. 
   Isaac notes that in Sarasota, Fla., where he resides, housing prices increased by 35 percent in one year alone, in 2005. 
   Isaac argues that such a rate of increase is ``unsustainable'' and was ``pushing housing prices beyond the reach of most people.'' 
   Why is all this happening now? Politics, says Isaac. 
   Americans have been ``spoiled'' by 25 consecutive years of prosperity and, during this year's election cycle, one in which a Democrat has a chance to take over the White House, ``roughly half of the population wants us to feel angst,'' he writes. 
   Some economic experts agree with Isaac's assessment of the banking industry. 
   ``Asset bubbles result in the misallocation of capital, which adversely affects economic growth,'' Donald P. Gould, president of Gould Asset Management, tells Moneynews. 
   ``Probably it is safer to let the market undo its own bubble.'' 
   Federal intervention in the market could result in a deflationary period just like that seen in Japan during the 1990s. 
   ``Witness what happened when the Bank of Japan pierced the Japanese real estate bubble,'' says Gould. ``A decade-plus of recession.'' 
   Ken Kamen, president of Mercadien Asset Management, tells Moneynews that an overreaction is not needed, as, ultimately, ``market forces will decide where money needs to be.''

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE DEFEAT OF THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this was an amazing day in the Congress of the United States. The American people were actually heard, and fear was put on the shelf as we stopped hasty action that Wall Street powerhouses had attempted to ram through this Congress. It was a sobering day. It was an exhausting day. Now we have to get to work to create a new moment: to draft legislation on a bipartisan basis that is responsible, that is rigorous and that meets the real needs. 
   This includes securities and exchange reform legislation to expand credit flows. The SEC and bank regulators must act immediately to suspend the fair value accounting rules; they must clamp down on abuses by short sellers, and they must withdraw the Basel II capital rules. These will go a long way to expanding credit flows at the local level. 
   We have to stabilize our housing markets on Main Street, and we have to reform the regulatory process and investigate the wrongdoers who brought America and the American people to this juncture. 
   We have to fund the FBI to go after those who have exhibited malfeasance, accounting fraud, who have used abusive practices, and who have made billions doing it. 
   I want to thank the American people and this Congress for doing what was right, not what was hasty. 
   Regulating Wall Street  
   The Fed's decision to open the discount window to Wall Street firms, and to subsidize the takeover of Bear Stearns, requires that we rethink the regulation of Wall Street. How we resolve the issues will have profound effect on our financial markets for years to come. 
   Before attempting to come up with answers, we need to make sure we know and understand the questions. I will try to identify the important ones. 
   A. Who Gets Access to the Safety Net? Under What Circumstances? What Price Do They Pay? The federal safety net (i.e., the ability to borrow from the Fed and to offer insured deposits) was created to promote stability in the banking and thrift industries, and the cost is borne by banks and thrifts. The deposit insurance fund now exceeds $50 billion, and each year the Fed pays to the Treasury billions of dollars of profits earned in part from interest-free reserves maintained by banks. 
   If we expand the safety net, which firms should be included--investment banks, hedge funds, leveraged buyout firms, insurance companies, others? How will we draw the line--size of firm, inter-connections to other firms, harm a failure would cause to consumers or businesses, the potential impact of a failure on financial stability? 
   If non-banks are granted access to the safety net, will they be required to help pay cost? Would it be fair to banks and thrifts to have invested billions per year in the safety net for much of the past century to suddenly allow non-banks to obtain the benefits of the safety net? What would be the competitive effects on banks and thrifts? 
   B. Who Will Regulate Our New Universe of Safety Net Firms? Treasury argues that we need to revamp the regulation of financial firms in view of the new world of finance in which commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, insurance companies, and others perform many of the same functions. It is suggested that we need to consolidate the regulators while designating a single ``market stability'' regulator. 
   I would argue that the genius of the American system of government is the diffusion of government power. We do not believe in centralized planning, and we rely heavily on checks and balances. 
   One of the clearest lessons of the S&L crisis of the 1980s is that we must have an independent deposit insurance agency armed with the full array of examination and enforcement powers. The former FSLIC, which insured deposits at S&Ls, was a toothless agency operating as a subsidiary of the primary regulator. The failure to provide that check on the S&L industry was an important contributing factor to a taxpayer loss of some $150 billion. Are we prepared to go down that path again in our pursuit of a tidy organizational chart? 
   We currently have at least four agencies heavily focused on maintaining stability in the financial markets--the Fed, the SEC, the FDIC, and Treasury. Do we really believe that having a single agency fretting about market stability will be an improvement? If so, which agency has been proven to have such all-knowing vision and wisdom? 
   The major problem confronting our financial system for the past year is the collapse in the residential real estate markets. Did the banking agencies and Treasury not notice that unregulated mortgage loan brokers were sprouting up everywhere, that securitizations were providing unprecedented liquidity to mortgage markets, that  home loan underwriting standards were deteriorating, and that home prices were skyrocketing? Did the agencies seek more information or take actions to dampen the frenzy, were they rebuffed, or did they not appreciate the potential problems? 
   Take a look at the public debate while the real estate bubble was building. You will find the Fed and Treasury touting the Basel II capital regime as the way to make more precise calculations of how much capital was really required in our banks. It was argued that this would allow our large banks to reduce their capital to international norms, or about half the U.S. level. Does that sound like folks who were concerned in the slightest about a bubble in real estate? 
   Thankfully, the FDIC, the OTS, and a few Congressional leaders fought against eliminating the minimum capital requirement for U.S. banks. As bad as things might be right now, how much worse they would be if Basel II had breezed through without a minimum capital standard and our major banks had leveraged their balance sheets even further during the past few years? 
   One final question to ponder as we debate our future: Would we be better served by a messy, contentious, and some times frustrating regulatory system that moves cautiously or by a highly efficient system that runs with alacrity off the nearest cliff? 
   Would it be more appropriate to legislate that non-banks develop and pay for their own safety net? Should we impose new standards to reduce greatly the odds that non-banks will ever need to use the safety net again? Might it be appropriate to enact tough ground rules restricting the ability of the Fed to lend to non-bank firms in the absence of a national emergency? Should the Fed be allowed to act unilaterally? 
   If non-bank firms are included in the bank-funded safety net, what sort of regulation will we impose on them? Will it be equivalent to the regulation of banks, i.e., capital regulation, liquidity requirements, examinations, reporting requirements, compliance regulations, limitations on loans to affiliates and officers and directors, restrictions on ownership and permissible activities, lending limits, and a full range of regulatory enforcement powers? 
   If non-bank firms are included in the bank-funded safety net and then fail, how will the failures be handled? Will they be subject to the receivership powers of the FDIC? If not, who will administer the receivership? 
   Do we want our central bank providing liquidity and also handling failures? We used to have a comparable system in the S&L industry with disastrous results. 
   If we go down the path of comparable regulation of commercial banks and investment banks, will investment banks be able to continue their high-risk underwriting and investment activities so vital to capitalism? If not, will they remain in the U.S. or move their headquarters to London or Dubai?  
   How To Save the Financial System  
   I am astounded and deeply saddened to witness the senseless destruction in the U.S. financial system, which has been the envy of the world. We have always gone through periods of correction, but today's problems are so much worse than they needed to be. 
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators must act immediately to suspend the Fair Value Accounting rules, clamp down on abuses by short sellers, and withdraw the Basel II capital rules. These three actions will go a long way toward arresting the carnage in our financial system. 
   During the 1980s, our underlying economic problems were far more serious than the economic problems we're facing this time around. The prime rate exceeded 21%. The savings bank industry was more than $100 billion insolvent (if we had valued it on a market basis), the S&L industry was in even worse shape, the economy plunged into a deep recession, and the agricultural sector was in a depression. 
   These economic problems led to massive credit problems in the banking and thrift industries. Some 3,000 banks and thrifts ultimately failed, and many others were merged out of existence. Continental Illinois failed, many of the regional banks tanked, hundreds of farm banks went down, and thousands of thrifts failed or were taken over. 
   It could have been much worse. The country's 10-largest banks were loaded up with Third World debt that was valued in the markets at cents on the dollar. If we had marked those loans to market prices, virtually every one of them would have been insolvent. Indeed, we developed contingency plans to nationalize them. 
   At the outset of the current crisis in the credit markets, we had no serious economic problems. Inflation was under control, GDP growth was good, unemployment was low, and there were no major credit problems in the banking system. 
   The dark cloud on the horizon was about $1.2 trillion of subprime mortgage-backed securities, about $200 billion to $300 billion of which was estimated to be held by FDIC-insured banks and thrifts. The rest were spread among investors throughout the world. 
   The likely losses on these assets were estimated by regulators to be roughly 20%. Losses of this magnitude would have caused pain for institutions that held these assets, but would have been quite manageable. 
   How did we let this serious but manageable situation get so far out of hand--to the point where several of our most respected American financial companies are being put out of business, sometimes involving massive government bailouts? 
   Lots of folks are assigning blame for the underlying problems--management greed, inept regulation, rating-agency incompetency, unregulated mortgage brokers and too much government emphasis on creating more housing stock. My interest is not in assigning blame for the problems but in trying to identify what is causing a situation, that should have been resolved easily, to develop into a crisis that is spreading like a cancer throughout the financial system. 
   The biggest culprit is a change in our accounting rules that the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC put into place over the past 15 years: Fair Value Accounting. Fair Value Accounting dictates that financial institutions holding financial instruments available for sale (such as mortgage-backed securities) must mark those assets to market. That sounds reasonable. But what do we do when the already thin market for those assets freezes up and only a handful of transactions occur at extremely depressed prices? 
   The answer to date from the SEC, FASB, bank regulators and the Treasury has been (more or less) ``mark the assets to market even though there is no meaningful market.'' The accounting profession, scarred by decades of costly litigation, just keeps marking down the assets as fast as it can. 
   This is contrary to everything we know about bank regulation. When there are temporary impairments of asset values due to economic and marketplace events, regulators must give institutions an opportunity to survive the temporary impairment. Assets should not be marked to unrealistic fire-sale prices. Regulators must evaluate the assets on the basis of their true economic value (a discounted cash-flow analysis). 
   If we had followed today's approach during the 1980s, we would have nationalized all of the major banks in the country and thousands of additional banks and thrifts would have failed. I have little doubt that the country would have gone from a serious recession into a depression. 
   If we do not halt the insanity of forcing financial firms to mark assets to a nonexistent market rather than their realistic economic value, the cancer will keep spreading and will plunge the world into very difficult economic times for years to come. 
   I argued against adopting Fair Value Accounting as it was being considered two decades ago. I believed we would come to regret its implementation when we hit the next big financial crisis, as it would deny regulators the ability to exercise judgment when circumstances called for restraint. That day has clearly arrived. 
   Equally egregious are the actions by the SEC in recent years lifting the restraints on short sellers of stocks to allow ``naked selling'' (shorting a stock without actually possessing it) and to eliminate the requirement that short sellers could sell only on an uptick in the market. 
   On top of this, it is my understanding that short sellers are engaged in abuses such as purchasing credit default swaps on corporate bonds (essentially bets on whether a borrower will default), which lowers the price of the bonds, which in turn causes the price of the company's stock to decline further. Then the ratings agencies pile on and reduce the ratings of a company because its reduced stock price will prevent it from raising new capital. The SEC must act immediately to eliminate these and other potential abuses by short sellers. 
   The Basel II capital rules adopted by the FDIC, Federal Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency last year are too new to have caused big problems, but they must be eliminated before they do. Basel II requires the use of very complex mathematical models to set capital levels in banks. The models use historical data to project future losses. If banks have a period of low losses (such as in the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s), the models require relatively little capital and encourage even more heated growth. When we go into a period like today where losses are enormous (on paper, at least), the models require more capital when none is available, forcing banks to cut back lending. 
   As I write this article, I am seeing proposals by some to create a new Resolution Trust Corp., as we did in the 1990s to clean up the S&L problems. The RTC managed and sold assets from S&Ls that had already failed. It was run by the FDIC, just like the FDIC. We needed to create the RTC in the 1990s only because we could not comingle the assets from failed banks with those of failed thrifts, because we had two separate deposit insurance funds absorbing the respective losses from bank and thrift failures. 
   I can't imagine why we would want to create another government bureaucracy to handle the assets from bank failures. What we need to do urgently is stop the failures, and an RTC won't do that. 
   Again, we must take three immediate steps to prevent a further rash of financial failures and taxpayer bailouts. First, the SEC must suspend Fair Value Accounting and require that assets be marked to their true economic value. Second, the SEC needs to immediately clamp down on abusive practices by short sellers. It has taken a first step in reinstituting the prohibition against ``naked selling.'' Finally, the bank regulators need to acknowledge that the Basel II capital rules represent a serious policy mistake and repeal the rules before they do real damage.  
   We are almost out of time if we hope to eradicate the cancer in our financial system.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (WHERE ARE THE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DIPLOMACY IN IRAQ? -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, next week, the chief commander of U.S. forces in Iraq will be up here before Congress, General David Petraeus, and he will be reporting on the conduct of the war. I can remember about a year ago, quite a large delegation from our defense subcommittee spent some time with General Petraeus in Iraq; and one statement that he made at that time remains in my mind, and I have shared it with every audience I have gone before. He said, Victory equals one-third military and two-thirds good governance and diplomacy. The two-thirds is missing. 
   Victory equals one-third military and two-thirds good governance and diplomacy and the two-thirds is missing in Iraq. So where does that place our soldiers? I have asked myself that every single minute of every single day since that discussion. The good governance and the diplomacy are nowhere. 
   The President of our country says, Well, I'm going to listen to my commanders in theater. 
   No, no. President Bush is the Commander in Chief. The military is doing their job, but they can only do one-third of the job. The other two-thirds rests on the top political leadership of this country, and they, and I would include every person in this room, and we have not done our jobs because the political equation, the good governance and diplomacy piece, is totally missing. 
   And so more soldiers die, more Iraqis die, and what is the vision? What is the vision for ultimate victory and exit of our troops? There isn't any. The President said mission was accomplished. No, the mission was just begun, but there is no end game. 
   Within Iraq, we have a corrupt and incapable state. They have billions of dollars in their budget unspent, our money, their money from oil. They're not spending it, yet the American people are going to be asked to appropriate another $170 billion here? Think about it, my friends. 
   Within Iraq, we broke the State. In Iraq, 2 1/2 million people thrown out of their homes within the country and another 2 1/2 million fleeing for their lives to Syria, to Jordan. And you know what? They will never be citizens of those countries. They're guests. They're actually refugees. We saw what happened with the Palestinians post-World War II. 600,000 of them still a refugee population with no homeland. And look at the difficulty that has caused the world. 
   So you say, Well, what is the mission? Are we winning the war on terrorism? Is America any more secure? 
   Well, we are having trouble in Afghanistan. The President had to beg NATO for more forces in Afghanistan. We've now got over 40,000 troops there. The situation there is not getting any better. And Pakistan, at the provincial level, the worst elements are being elected. Maybe that isn't the right adjective. But those that are most anti-American are being elected. There's trouble between Afghanistan and Pakistan at the border in those provinces. We don't have a solution there. 
   And Turkey, our closest ally in NATO for years. What is happening with elections at the provincial level there, mayors and so forth? The most anti-American individuals are being elected. That is true in Pakistan at the provincial level. 
   So you can say all you want to say about winning this war on terrorism, but how do you win a war when the majority of the people turn against this country? And you say to our military, You fix it. You fix it. 
   General Petraeus' testimony up here next week simply isn't enough. We need to hear from the President of the United States, not just passing the buck to, Well, let the generals tell me what to do. No. What is he going to do to accomplish this mission and bring  our troops home and begin to repair the image of the United States across a vast growing region of the world where we are losing friends every day from North Africa, from Egypt, all the way through to Pakistan and Afghanistan? What are we going to do to correct the damage that is producing more terrorists, more anti-Americanism and less resolution? 
   Don't just place this burden on the backs of our brilliant military. They have been asked to do everything this President has sent them to do. But as General Petraeus wisely told us a year ago, victory means one-third military and two-thirds good governance and diplomacy, and the two-thirds is missing and it has been missing and it is missing. 
   What can we do? Why didn't the President take two of our exemplary ambassadors, people like Zbigniew Brzezinski and James Baker, put them on the same airplane, send them over to Iraq, work with the neighboring countries of Iraq, give us a date certain in order to begin redeploying forces to an over-the-horizon position? Give us a time: 6 months, 1 year, 1 year and 3 months? Let's have a plan. There is no plan. 
   The only plan is to send more troops to keep extending deployments to put more burden on our military, to ask our Marines to become civilian officials within that country with the civilian workload when they're trying to be a strike force. What kind of solution is that? It's asking too much of our military. Let's give them the respect they're due but ask the person in charge as Commander in Chief to give America the plan for victory and ultimate redeployment from that region and building back the kind of friendships with adjoining nations that will not give our children and grandchildren the burden of fighting terrorism two decades or more down the road.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FAILED TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Congressman Michaud, thank you so much for bringing us together tonight and for your great contributions to this debate. That is probably the major economic debate this Nation faces. It is a real pleasure to be here with you this evening. I thank you for yielding me some time. 
   And to Congressman Phil Hare from Illinois, who has just hit the ground running here and who I think is such a tremendous addition to our membership and to this great struggle for the cause of all people in our country, the dignity of their work, the future for their families and the future of our communities. 
   And to Congressman Steve Lynch of Massachusetts, who works so respectably as an ironworker. He looks like that man that they have on that iron beam over New York City, that famous poster. Whenever I look at him, I think I see him. He is the one who is swinging the golf club with the ball or something. 
   It is a pleasure to be here with these gentlemen tonight, because they have all worked for a living, their families have worked for a living, and we need more people who bring this experience to the Congress of the United States. 
   The plant that Congressman Michaud discussed, Champion spark plugs, no longer exists in Toledo. Back when I was first elected, we tried so hard to get the Japanese to buy the spark plugs, the best plugs that were made in the whole country, Champion spark plugs. 
   I took them to Japan in 1985, and I said to Prime Minister Nakasone, ``Your companies aren't buying from our premier companies.'' Our trade deficit was beginning to really get bad back then, so I said, ``So I would like to suggest that we give you these plugs for free for your manufacturers, and let them try them.'' 
   And we learned a lot about the keiratsu system of Japan and what a closed system indeed it is and that other companies couldn't bid into that production and that these very tight buying chains exist globally. Japan has been eating our lunch in the automotive market for a very long time now, but the Japanese market still remains closed, with less than 3 percent of the cars on their streets from anywhere else in the world. They didn't even take Yugos or bugs, VW bugs. So that market is a closed market, and we began to see how difficult it was to engage in trade with nations who truly were protectionists. 
   Congressman Hare talked about protectionist countries. You can see pretty clearly which ones they are when you look at what is on their shelves and what is on their streets. 
   I am here tonight to say that I have never supported fast track, because I don't believe Congress should ever let a fast ball go through here that we don't grab ahold of. And the problem is you can't amend a trade agreement. So even if you want to, as happened when we debated NAFTA, I can't remember a more piercing debate in this Congress other than votes on war. That NAFTA debate was the most significant economic debate we had here in 1993; and at the time that we debated that, it was purposefully brought to the floor in a way that we could not amend. 
   So let me just take one issue. We are going to have discussions this year on the issue of immigration. When that bill came down here, there were many of us who said we have to deal with the displacement that is going to happen in Mexico in the farm sector, because there is no transition provision in NAFTA and no currency exchange, that we knew that the Mexican farmers were going to be thrown off of their community oriented farming ejido systems. It has happened. No one wants to recognize it has happened, but over 2 million people were disgorged from their villages and towns, and they are wandering the continent, providing an endless stream of labor that is dirt cheap there and here. It is almost as if they didn't want us to talk about it because that fast track bill came through here. 
   Now, the NAFTA model is being used, they want to expand it to Colombia, they want to put it to Peru. 
   I wanted to say a word about Colombia this evening. I agree with Congressman Michaud. There is no nation in the world that allows the assassination of their labor leaders more than Colombia. Why would we want to sign a free trade agreement with a country that isn't free? Our cardinal rule ought to be: Free trade among free people.  
   When we look at what happened in Colombia recently, Chiquita brands, remember Chiquita Banana, which is headquartered in my State of Ohio, has just pleaded guilty to funding terrorism in Colombia. Several what are called unidentified high-ranking corporate officers of a subsidiary of Chiquita paid $1.7 million from 1997 through 2004 to fund the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a group that our country says is a terrorist organization. And Chiquita also bribed other groups inside of Colombia. 
   The company has now admitted to this wrongdoing and agreed to pay $25 million in fines. They said that the money was paid to protect employees from violent paramilitaries who fight over the banana plantations. I wouldn't wish working on a Colombian banana plantation to any living human being.     
   And yet we are about to sign a free trade agreement under fast track that we can't amend and stand up for the dignity of people in Colombia. 
   We know that the Colombian worker isn't safe; yet the President evidently thinks it is okay to sign an agreement where there is no transparent justice system, where bribes and protections and murders are every-day occurrences. Where are our values as a country? Why has it taken us almost 20 years from 1985 to 1995 to 2005, now it is 2007, to bring this issue up? We had to have so many casualties in this country. We tried 23 years ago so the hurt would not be so bad. And the gentlemen that are here this evening, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Michaud, Mr. Hare, Mr. Ellison, they represent those who are suffering in our country. There are people suffering in other countries, too. 
   I want to say I associate myself with the gentleman's remarks this evening. And what you said about those who have been murdered in Colombia, we know 72 were murdered in 2006, and the gentleman talked about prior assassinations of those who were trying to form groups there so they could earn a decent wage. Almost none have been prosecuted. It is like their lives have no meaning. So we need to set a higher standard. Maybe our Constitution really should stand for something and we should look for an agreement among the peoples of the Americas that uses democracy and liberty as its fundamental principles, not the diminishing of workers, be they farmers or industrial workers. 
   I oppose the Colombian free trade agreement and stand up for human rights, the middle class, the rule of law, and everything that this Nation should be committed to.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Congressman Hare and I are thinking about going to track the whole Maytag saga, starting in his home community but then going over to Iowa and the whole buyout of Maytag by Wall Street and the shedding of jobs, thousands, thousands of jobs. 
   Then, in my home State of Ohio, 2,000 more jobs hang in the balance at a place called Hoover Vacuum, which was part of this leveraged buyout. There was an article recently in the paper about the Maytags now being made by Samsung in South Korea, 250,000 of them being recalled in this country because they are burning up. They are actually catching on fire because water is dripping off the back onto the electrical panel. That never happened with Maytag. The Maytag repairman really was in that little room, and nobody bothered him. 
   I think it is important for us as Members to tell the story, whether it is Maytag, whether it is Champion, Dixon Ticonderoga, companies that Congressman Michaud worked for, and whether it is Maytag. We need to help America give full voice to what is happening. 
   It is interesting how little is on television, because some of the very same advertisers that own the airwaves do not want this story on there. 
   I understand Lou Dobbs is coming to Congress this week for a hearing that Congressman Sherman is going to have. That is one of the few reporters that even talks about this, but for the most part you do not see this on the evening news. 
   So I am very anxious to travel and tell the Maytag story and then maybe tell the story of Brachs Candy and tell the story of some our steel mills and to give these workers, first, appreciation for the fine products that they have built and it is not their fault and to say that we understand, but we know we are outnumbered sometimes, but our numbers are growing.

   Ms. KAPTUR. But our numbers are growing. 
   We said when NAFTA passed it was the first battle in a long war, and we knew there were going to be casualties, and it literally broke our heart because we knew what was going to happen on this continent. 
   But now we have the next wave that came in when Congressman Michaud arrived; and now, with 39 new Members in your class, Congressman Hare, to come here, and you cannot imagine what that means to the more senior Members. 
   Our only sadness is all the casualties that are out there and all the people that have had to suffer. We had hoped to protect America from that. We had hoped to protect those families, but we did not have the votes. 
   But now I think we have the votes. 
   I know one thing, we have the American people. Sometimes things get a little convoluted once it comes into this city, but we know the American people are with us. Let us make them famous. They are the ones that have lived this. Let us put it on our Web sites. Let us tell their stories. If others will not, let us do that. They surely deserve that. They have lived it.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I think that if we look at those people that are trying to sell off chunks of America piece by piece, I am offended by that. I am truly offended by it. 
   When I heard the announcement that Hershey, one of America's logo companies, right, was going to move production to Mexico, they are already making those big kisses there, I guess. I did not know that. When you think of all the dairy jobs in Pennsylvania, you think of all of the factory jobs, you think of all of the distribution jobs. I mean, this is a massive American company. It was America. It was America. And so now we are going to let that go? And then they dumbed down the recipe so the chocolate is not as good? They put more wax in it or whatever. Come on. 
   Do not take the American people for fools. We understand what is going on, and we know that we are being sold out. America is being sold out from under us, and the American people do not like it at all. They expect us to stand up for them. 
   So it is just a joy to have you here, to be a part of this effort, and to say that the Peru and Colombian free trade agreement that is supposed to come through here on fast track, again, it is more just of NAFTA. It is more of the same. We should not approve it. 
   But what has surprised me the most, as much as the American people have been hurt by NAFTA, if we go back, what has shocked me, what I never expected or anticipated, was all the casualties across the continent in terms of job loss and people hurt. I never thought I would see the people of Latin America rise up in Mexico, in Brazil, in these massive demonstrations. That has literally humbled me as a citizen of the continent to think that the poorest among us, many have been risking their lives, to say the pain on them is even greater than on us. Their wages have been cut in half. They are losing their little stakeholds in Mexico, for example, and they are just being thrown off their land, and yet they are going to Mexico City and demonstrating by the millions. 
   I never anticipated that that would happen, and I think what is going to happen here, those folks in Wall Street and other places thought they were going to be so smart. I think you are going to see another generation come behind us. They are going to create a charter for the people of the Americas that we should have created. Some of us wanted to, but we did not have the votes here, and I think that the backlash on NAFTA and on these kinds of free trade agreements that cause so much harm, I think Wall Street has only begun to see what is going to happen. 
   So I put my faith in the people, I put my faith in the institutions of good governance, and I hope that, I do not know how harshly God will judge those who have done so much harm, but it did not have to happen.     
   We don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past, so I thank my dear colleagues here this evening, Congressman Michaud and Congressman Hare and Congressman Lynch and Congressman Ellison, for understanding what it is going to take to turn this continent and our values to put the values forward that were the ideals. 
   When I think about John Kennedy and his Alliance For Progress, and you go down in Latin America and in every home there is a picture of John Kennedy because he cared for them. He cared for them first. I thought how did we go so far? Why couldn't we get a majority here? What was wrong with us back in the 1990s, that is, that we couldn't put that together? I see a rebirth of that spirit of idealism here this evening, and I know that the continent is waiting for us. 
   I thank my dear colleagues for sponsoring this Special Order this evening and for helping us speak on behalf of the people who expect us to be here for them.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICA NEEDS REAL FINANCIAL REFORM, NOT A BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I would like to place in the Record the measuring sticks against which I will weigh any proposal brought before this Congress to bail out Wall Street investment houses. 
   Number one, financial reform must come first. America needs reform, not a bailout. Over the last 20 years, legislation has been passed by this Congress, H.R. 1278 in 1989 called FIRREA, interstate banking in 1994 which created those big mega banks, and H.R. 10/S. 900 in 1999, which overturned the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed banking, real estate and insurance all to be under the roof of the same firm. 
   Well all those bills together have created a highly concentrated financial system, particularly in housing finance, rather than a decentralized one like that which we had for most of the 20th century. This bailout is the result of high-risk misbehavior by distant financial giants. They have sucked equity out of local communities and turned local markets into derivative, debt-ridden communities rather than independent, robust, credit markets with prudent savings and lending practices. 
   Reform should restore those prudent and transparent banking practices defining the difference between banks and investment houses and protecting and restoring the protections that existed prior to 1999 when that Glass-Steagall Act was eliminated. Conflicts of interest at bond rating agencies should be addressed by such agencies becoming public. Reform, as I say, and regulation should come first out the door before the money, not later.     
   Number two, Main Street housing market deflation must be stabilized as step one. A moratorium should be placed on all home foreclosures for 120 days. That will take us into the new year. And deflation in the housing market really is what has triggered this credit crunch. The Federal Reserve could use its influence through its regionalized structure to bring parties together to work out affected loans in places like Ohio to stabilize local real estate and housing markets. That is where the real assets are and where the markets must clear and adjust. 
   What a crime it would be if people are thrown out of their homes and an institution somewhere over in England like Barclays becomes the owner of those assets and gets them at fire-sale prices. We need to put those assets back in the hands of the American people. 
   The traditional home loan backed by savings deposits was converted into a bond during the 1990s and then securitized into those international markets. The time-tested loan standards of character, collateral and collectibility were shelved, and therefore to reform this system it must be decentralized again, with the community savings and home loan bank system being reestablished with an emphasis on increasing savings deposits with enhanced local mortgage origination and oversight, as opposed to concentration of activity in Wall Street investment houses. 
   Number three, a new Financial Assets Management Board should be formed to manage this mortgage refinancing and workouts at the local level, similar to FDR's Homeowner Loan Corporation. 
   Fourth, the Department of Justice should be authorized to investigate the wrongdoers, to track down the fraud, misrepresentation of asset value, insider trading and related crimes in this scandal. There should be over 500 attorneys and accountants and support staff to conduct thorough investigations, forensic accounting and prosecution. 
   Fifth, any Federal dollar that is expended must result in equity to our taxpayers. If our people are going to be forced to fund unlimited private sector bad debt, our people must receive an equity share in every Wall Street financial company proportional to the amount of bad debt held that is shifted to the taxpayer. 
   Our people are being asked to take 100 percent of the risk. They should be afforded the benefit of any future profits. A 0.25 percent transaction fee should be charged on every Wall Street trade or Chicago Board of Trade transaction, and that $150 billion a year that will be yielded should pay the American people back over time. 
   Sixth, a select congressional committee should be established to hold hearings, do proper oversight and advise the next President and Congress on mortgage and financial recovery operations and additional means to assure any necessary repayment of public investment. 
   Seven, standards for executives and compensation structure in the financial services industry should be established. Those outlandish salaries that they get should be curbed, and all bonuses, stock options and exceptional compensation for those individuals and their boards of directors should be discouraged. We should help to pay the bill by going after some of their assets. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to place this in the RECORD, and also include bankruptcy reform as one of the major changes that we need to make in any measure. These are the steps that would actually result in market recovery, not just bailing out unknown assets and bad debts from Wall Street. 
   Kaptur: Real Reform or Nothing--Financial Reform Must Come First 
   America needs real financial reform first, not a bailout. Over the last 20 years, legislation passed by Congress (HR 1278 in 1989, HR 3841 in 1994, and HR 10/S 900 in 1999) has highly concentrated financial activities on Wall Street--particularly housing finance--rather than decentralized them. This bailout is the result of high risk misbehavior by distant financial giants. They have sucked equity out of local communities and turned local markets into derivative, debt-ridden communities rather than independent robust credit markets with prudent savings and lending practices. 
   Such reform should restore prudent and transparent banking practices. Reform of the deregulated financial structure should start with defining the difference between banks and investment houses and restoring protection that existed prior to 1999 when the Glass-Steagall Act was eliminated. Each should have defined activities and be regulated separately. 
   Conflicts of interest at bond rating agencies should be addressed by such agencies becoming public. 
   Reform and regulation should come first, not later. Franklin Delano Roosevelt invented the basic framework that served  America well for the last century. Congress should adapt it to current challenges on a Jeffersonian model, not the proposed Hamiltonian approach.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and am very pleased to join Congressman LaTourette in paying warm, warm appreciation and thank-you's, gratitude, so many memories, to our beautiful colleagues RALPH REGULA and DEBORAH PRYCE, and I don't know whether DAVE HOBSON would want me to call him beautiful or not, but I guess I can. He has a beautiful soul. 
   These are moments that are very hard, because all those years come crowding in on you. For each one of these wonderful, wonderful Members I will at the right time this evening share some personal recollections. 
   With their eventual departure from here, Ohio will lose over 50 years of seniority. That is a staggering figure. And it isn't just the years, it is the friendships, the experience, the respect with which each of them is held, and the wonderful give-and-take that comes from getting to know Members well across the aisle. 
   I thank each of them on behalf of the people of our State for the major portion of their lives that they have given to this institution and for every single success that they have had legislatively here, that has helped build a better America and a better Ohio, and I thank them for their personal integrity throughout, carrying that torch forward for our great Buckeye State. 
   There are many others that wish to speak, and I will reserve at this time, but I just want to say I thank RALPH for your friendship. I thank Mary for hers, for all we have worked on together, including the First Ladies' Library, for all of the park systems all over this country, all of our great work on Appropriations. Those are memories that I will always have. 
   To DEBORAH PRYCE, one of the few women from the Ohio delegation actually, all the years we have spent here together, and her kindness and her strength under leadership pressures here, as well as family pressures. She was strong and a survivor, and really a role model for us all. 
   And certainly to DAVE HOBSON, who has this uncanny habit of just being able to weave in and out down all these aisles in this place, and he always seems to know where you are, he finds you in the back in the cloakroom or wherever, and all of our great work on Appropriations together, and his desire to reach across the aisle and to work with us, whether it was defense, whether it was energy, whether it was education, health care. 
   We are really going to miss you all, each of you. I just thank you for being a friend to me while I have been able to serve here. And I thank Congressman LaTourette for giving me a moment here to place a few words on the Record. I shall remain throughout this hour. Thank you.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE RALPH REGULA, THE HONORABLE DEBORAH PRYCE AND THE HONORABLE DAVID HOBSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. 
   In order of seniority, I would like to say to the dean of the delegation, Ralph Regula, there are many memories, perhaps not legislative, that I take with me relating to your service. One is your discussions about your red truck, and you were so happy when you bought it. 
   Of course, Congressman Regula, being a farmer and I suppose some would say an Ohio rancher, you know, men really never grow up. He loved that little truck. He drove it in the garage downstairs. It was always shiny. He was really proud of it. He used to drive it back to Ohio. 
   I remember one time I came down the hallway in the Rayburn Building, and he was kind of coming out of his office. I said, Ralph, what's wrong, and he had been kicked by a cow over the weekend. I guess he was kind of repairing himself there. I thought, well, that's the first Member I have met who was kicked by a cow. 
   I remember when I first arrived, you and your lovely wife Mary were friends with Doug and Betty Applegate. That's when I first got to Congress. That was a great moment. 
   We used to have those fashion shows wearing U.S.-made clothing which has become almost nonexistent, which is another story. But there were annual fashion shows, and Mary and Ralph and Betty and Doug would welcome us into that. It was really great to do that and to begin to focus attention in America on the issue of trade and jobs, which has become so much of the challenge that we face today. 
   I can remember, in our committee, Ralph holding the gavel of his subcommittee and being asked by the Chairs, and then when he was Chair himself, calling for the committee to adjourn after various votes had been taken and the high regard, right up at the top. I mean, he moved all the way up from the last seat all the way up to the first seat on that dais, and I always see them there. 
   I think from Mary I will remember Mary in Canton with the Mary Todd Lincoln gown and hat. I think I will always remember what a great, great moment that was, what a great gift to America you have given just in that one, in that one place of such historical significance that we will keep building forward. 
   For Deborah Pryce, I will say I shall always remember her as the, I believe, first woman Chair of her caucus, and very few women. I think when Deborah got here, there couldn't have been over 30 women in the House, maybe, it wasn't very much. 
   So for her to ascend and to plow a path for her daughter, and for the women of the future, was just so wonderful, and to be able to share that moment and to watch that happen, and the great pressure that is placed on someone in that position, and how she handled it so ably and always with great dispatch. 
   I remember her as a new mother and trying to handle motherhood as well as that enormous responsibility, and she did it, her great dedication to cancer research, pediatric cancer research and the contribution she made for all children in this country, and to find better answers in that terribly, terribly important area of health care. Also, our participation in a prayer group here in the Capitol, and the friendships and the camaraderie that came from that, those are moments that you never, never forget. 
   For Dave Hobson, obviously, you know, he loves this place, he loves being a lawmaker. I don't know what he is going to do after this. But, energy and water, that was his thing. He traveled all over the country, all over the world. He knew every general in the Army Corps of Engineers, I think, by first name, and loved helping build things for America. 
   When I think of armored Humvees, I will always think of Dave Hobson. I don't know if any other American will, but I will always associate armored Humvees and up-armored Humvees with Dave. His dedication to nuclear power, safe nuclear power, no one could have tried harder, studied that issue harder and made a difference than Dave Hobson. 
   He has that certain sparkle in his eye that former Representative and Speaker pro tempore, Barney Coulter, would identify with very, very much and for the great work that Dave contributed, not just here, but in our State legislature, to help building the Medical College of Ohio at Toledo. Our people will always be eternally grateful. 
   So to each of them from our side of the aisle, we extend deepest, deepest gratitude, and Godspeed in the years ahead. May you be given good health. May you have more time to spend with your families, and may there be less pressure and more joy in the days ahead. It has been a real privilege to serve with each of you.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (BLACKWATER'S OPERATING LICENSE IS REVOKED -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Government of Iraq today took the extraordinary step of revoking the operating license of Blackwater U.S.A. in light of accusations that Blackwater employees killed eight Iraqi civilians. Blackwater is a North Carolina-based firm providing private security forces inside Iraq. 
   This incident has caused another international uproar about the role of the United States in Iraq. Here at home, it is bringing long overdue attention to the role of the so-called contractors. Some call them mercenaries, as many of them are paid more than five times what our regular forces are paid. 
   The role of private contractors is an issue about which I have been ringing the alarm bell in this House and in the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee for a long time. 
   Now the Government of Iraq has been compelled to pull the plug on Blackwater U.S.A. The company claims its employees were acting in self-defense. Many people in Iraq claim the company committed atrocities. Who knows the truth? Who has the authority to investigate? Where is the accountability when it comes to private contractors? 
   How many such hired guns are operating in Iraq? Some say 25,000. Some say more. How many contractors totally are operating in Iraq? Some have estimated the number at 180,000, which is more than the U.S. military we have based in Iraq. 
   Here in Washington, Congress and the President are debating the proper troop levels for U.S. forces. But, meanwhile, there seem to be more and more contractors operating in Iraq. Due to the unpopularity of this war, I have little doubt that the Bush-Cheney plan is to replace our military forces with paid mercenaries. This would be the first time in U.S. history that our Nation will act as an occupying force by contracted mercenaries. 
   Indeed, the contracting out process of the U.S. military started in a small way back in the 1980s when Vice President Cheney was Secretary of Defense. It expanded greatly under the first President Bush, and now it has exploded in this administration. 
   America, pay attention. Make no mistake: private contractors are also very much the face of the West in the Middle East. They might be accountable only to their bosses and shareholders, but they are Americans in the eyes of Iraqis. Blackwater's eviction from Iraq comes as no surprise to those of us who have followed the now well-established, usually irresponsible use of defense contractors as mercenary forces. In fact, I believe that you cannot win in an engagement through the use of mercenary forces. 
   Blackwater is not the only defense contracting firm operating irresponsibly in lieu of our well-trained and well-respected military. Unlike our government, the Iraqi Government seems to recognize this. 
   Today, The New York Times reported that the Iraqi Government said it would review the status of all foreign and local security companies working in Iraq. According to the Private Security Company Association of Iraq, the Iraqi Government has suspended the licenses of two other security companies, but they were reinstated after a review.  
   Problems with private contractors are not a new phenomenon. In December, a Blackwater employee killed one of the Iraqi Vice President's guards but was never charged under Iraqi or American law because private contractors enjoy immunity, thanks to a law imposed by the United States. 
   On July 12, 2005, I delivered a floor statement after Iraqis cheered the brutal death of four Blackwater contractors in Fallujah. I pointed out that those soldiers of fortune are not bound by the same values of duty and honor like those brave young men and women serving in our regular forces, and those contracted forces are paid astronomically more than our regular forces. 
   There aren't just problems in theater. There are problems right here in Washington, like the opaque and often unfair process of awarding no-bid contracts. In fact, Blackwater has won over $505 million in publicly identifiable contracts since 2000 and in 2003 was awarded a $21 million no-bid contract to guard the Director of the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, Mr. Bremer. Why aren't our regular forces doing that? 
   I have raised questions before about these contractors and their behavior in Iraq and Afghanistan, but to no avail, in a Congress still not focused on upholding the great traditions of the U.S. military, and that means regular force, not mercenary force, not contracted force. 
   Mr. Speaker, the private contractors in Iraq all too often are rogue elephants, operating beyond the command and control system of our U.S. military. It is time to restore the time-heralded tradition of regular forces of this U.S. military, committed to duty, honor and country, not bounty.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (OIL INDUSTRY WILL BE UNABLE TO MEET WORLD DEMAND OVER NEXT 25 YEARS -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the oil industry admitted this week that it will be unable to meet world demand over the next 25 years. In case anyone still needed a wake-up call about the importance of energy independence, surely, that is that call. 
   Yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported on page 2 that a U.S. government-commissioned study, a study conducted by the oil industry itself, reveals that oil and gas supplies will not keep pace with worldwide demand through the year 2030. 
   According to the oil industry study, demand is expected to increase between 50 and 60 percent due to mounting consumption in the developed world, plus the growing economies of China and India. 
   According to the Journal, the finding suggests that far from being temporary, high energy prices are likely for decades to come. The study's conclusions appear to be the first explicit concession by the petroleum industry itself that it cannot meet the burgeoning global demand for oil, which may rise as much as 120 million barrels a day by 2030 up from 84 million barrels a day currently. 
   These findings are consistent with what the United States Government already reported in February through the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy. They projected world liquids demand to increase to 117 million barrels per day in 2030. 
   They also projected the real price of crude oil in 2030 to be about $95 in nominal terms, which would be over $59 a barrel in this year's dollars, and the price of natural gas to be $9.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other words, the U.S. Government itself, through the Energy Information Administration, an arm of our Department of Energy, acknowledges we will become more dependent on foreign energy in coming years. Not less dependent, but more dependent. Not more independent, but more dependent. To me, that is not acceptable. 
   For the consumer, it means higher and higher gasoline prices. For the economy, it means higher trade deficits and slower growth. For our Government, for our Nation, it means less independence, greater entanglements and likely more wars. 
   President Bush has talked about energy independence. But what has he really done? In his most recent State of the Union, he talked about ending our addiction to oil and everybody dutifully applauded, but we are more dependent on foreign energy sources today than we were 6 years ago when he mouthed the words, indeed. Under his administration, this country is importing 1 billion more barrels of oil since he first took office. Today, we are importing three-quarters of the petroleum it takes to drive this economy. 
   Now, the Presidential candidates are criss-crossing our country, and each candidate has a piece in their stump speech that mentions the words, ``energy independence.'' But will any of them deliver anything significant on these promises? 
   I have introduced a number of bills which will move America toward real energy independence. My Biofuels Energy Independence Act of 2007, H.R. 2218, protects our feedstocks from commodity price distortions, and we see what's happening in the ethanol market and the biodiesel market today. We ought to have broad ownership of that industry and not allow the cartelized structure that characterizes today's oil and gas industry to be repeated in this new biofuels sector. 
   I am proud to be part of a coalition here supporting H.R. 969, a bill to expand the renewable energy standard and the renewable energy portfolio to spawn new energy production in this country and new business and new jobs related to it, to capture all those dollars that we are siphoning up and sending to other countries, to turn those around and bring them back home. 
   I have a bill to supplement the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, H.R. 682, with domestically produced biofuels. Soon I will be introducing the Energy Smart Communities Act that encourages and aids local jurisdiction undertaking energy efficiency initiatives, including solar roofs and wind turbines across our country. 
   My goal has always been simple, to devote the resources it will take to reinvent our economy and transform our  energy portfolio in this century, in the first decade of this century. Our Nation is, indeed, at a crossroads, and the stakes are in plain sight. Do we travel the road of independence, creating jobs here at home, making affordable energy available to our consumers and businesses, or do we remain in the grip of the petrol kingdoms of the Middle East? 
   Do we issue a new declaration of energy and independence from foreign control, or do we allow our foreign policy to be perverted by our addiction to oil? Do we get serious about climate change and move aggressively to develop cleaner, safer, alternative fuels, or do we leave our future in the hands of the world oil oligarchy? The choice is ours.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE FARM LABOR RECRUITMENT SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, on April 9, 2007, 29-year-old Toledoan, Santiago Raphael Cruz, was found bound, gagged and beaten to death in Monterrey, Mexico, in the office of his employer, the Toledo-based Farm Labor Organizing Committee, or FLOC. 
   Mr. Cruz moved from Toledo, Ohio, to Mexico 3 months ago to legally arrange for Mexican guest laborers to work for a North Carolina pickle plant with which FLOC has a contract. FLOC's efforts assured guest workers were treated humanely, that their papers were legal, and that the notorious crime-ridden labor recruitment system that characterizes farm labor on this continent would cease to exist. 
   FLOC, which is part of the AFL-CIO, is a farm labor union and social movement based in our district led by Baldemar Velasquez. FLOC is perhaps most recently known for achieving a fair labor contract for guest workers in the United States with H2A visas in North Carolina. Mr. Velasquez led that campaign, as well as one to organize pickle workers in Ohio in the 1980s, and has been recognized as a MacArthur Foundation fellow. 
   In Mexico, FLOC offered a safe, legal alternative to the exploitative promises of coyotes and those who charge exorbitant fees to smuggle Mexicans across the border. The union had been burglarized, and the workers harassed for their efforts to protect Mexicans wishing to work in our country. 
   I learned, as I learned more about Mr. Cruz's brutal murder, I asked myself whether this horrendous crime could have been encouraged by FLOC's noble efforts to stop the illegal trafficking and continental labor caused by NAFTA. I have called upon the governments of the United States and Mexico to fully investigate and bring the perpetrators of this horrendous crime to justice. These coyotes prey upon desperate Mexican workers whose lands were taken from them by the Mexican Government under NAFTA. NAFTA set up conditions in North America for cruel exploitation of millions of landless peasants and workers in Mexico. 
   Mr. Velasquez and FLOC worked endlessly to give people not only legal rights but hope for an end to the harsh treatment handed to them by the governments of the United States and of Mexico. The current and often illegal labor recruitment system is rife with corruption. It exploits landless peasants through a corrupt bounty system imposed by unsavory labor recruiters. 
   Many times I have said NAFTA fuels illegal immigration by creating an exodus of massive proportion of people from the Mexican countryside who need something to eat after their livelihoods are taken from them. The manner in which these people are being exploited is a continental sacrilege. The problem with NAFTA and NAFTA-style trade agreements is they fail to take people into account. 
   NAFTA and NAFTA-style agreements serve the interests primarily of the money classes. They reduce risks for Wall Street investors while raising the risk that workers in our heartland will lose their jobs and health care. They are manna for hedge funds, but a threat to the economic security of blue collar workers.     
   They leave people out of the question. Whether it is campesinos in Mexico trying to provide food for their families and eke out an existence taken from them by their own government in cahoots with ours through NAFTA, or auto workers in the Midwest pursuing the American dream of a house, a car, and a better life for their children, they are the forgotten people in our global economy. 
   As Mr. Velasquez noted, Mr. Cruz had a good heart and was working for the people. Mr. Cruz gave his life in service to the forgotten people. We honor his commitment and we extend our sympathies to his family, to his friends, and to the entire FLOC community of which our community is so very proud. 
   His horrific death reminds us how brutal and unforgiving the NAFTA-induced labor system has become across our continent. It is time to renegotiate NAFTA. It is time not to extend it further. It is time to require continental labor standards that uphold the dignity of human life, not extinguish it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit extraneous material for printing in the Record, and I thank my colleague from Washington for allowing me to speak.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE HOUSING STIMULUS PLAN -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, The Politico, a newspaper that is published and distributed here in the Congress, has an article today about how hard the Democrats are working to address the housing stimulus plan that the American people are waiting for. 
   In places like Ohio, the mortgage foreclosure rate is at all-time highs, and Washington seems to be frozen. There was a program passed here that I voted for for housing counseling to try to help workouts a few months ago; and then I learned that, in a community as hard struck as northern Ohio is, it yielded $60,000. $60,000 in a region where hundreds and hundreds of people are losing their homes.     
   Washington doesn't seem to be able to match the reality of what is happening across this country. 
   A newspaper today reports that Senator CHRIS DODD from the other body stated that ``Congress needs cooperation. This is not a partisan issue. Our economy is in trouble. We need people to step up and recognize it is Americans that are at risk, and it is America that is at risk.'' 
   The figures state that in another sign of distressed housing markets, home equity dipped below 50 percent, an historic low for our Nation. Home mortgage volume fell by 17.5 percent last quarter, and pending home sales also are reaching new lows. We know what the reality is. And yet today, all the major papers had lead stories about the resignation of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Alphonso Jackson. USA Today reports: ``HUD chief departure a blow to President. 
   ``For the first time in President Bush's tenure, one of his Cabinet members is stepping down amid a criminal investigation.'' 
   The article continues: ``The FBI has been investigating the ties between Mr. Jackson and a friend who was paid $392,000 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as a construction manager in New Orleans, according to the Associated Press.'' It is quite a long story about that resignation. 
   And then in the Washington Post, the same sort of story, ``Jackson Resigns as HUD Secretary, Longtime Bush Friend is Facing Cronyism Investigation.'' 
   Mr. Jackson announced his resignation yesterday, leaving the Bush administration without a top housing official in the midst of this vast mortgage crisis which has shaken not just the American economy but the global economy. 
   The New York Times lead editorial today: ``Put the Housing Back in HUD.'' Boy, can we underline that. 
   It talks about what a sad commentary it is on the Bush administration's low regard for HUD's mission that Mr. Jackson was permitted to remain in office for so long. And it points out in 2006, an inspector general's report found Mr. Jackson had urged his staff members to favor Mr. Bush's supporters when it awarded contracts. And more recently, the Philadelphia Housing Authority sued Mr. Jackson, charging he had threatened to take away $50 million from that authority because its president would not turn over valuable property to a developer with ties to Mr. Jackson. He has refused to answer the Senate's questions about the matter, and the Times ends with this admonition: ``Mr. Jackson's resignation clears the way for President Bush to name a top caliber successor, given the seriousness of the mortgage crisis.'' It should also be an occasion to reflect on the cost of appointing HUD secretaries whose priorities are politics and patronage rather than housing and urban development, which was the mission of HUD from the very beginning. 
   We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Kerner Commission Report; and as we look at the disaster we are facing in housing across this country that demands a national response, to have the major official here in our Nation's capital have to step down under a cloud of wrongdoing, and to have no one in place, a team of people who can really reach out to the American people and help as many of them as possible hold onto their largest form of savings, which is their home, is an absolute national disgrace. 
   It seems like the organizations that are here in our Nation's capital aren't really serious about helping the American people to hold onto their most prized possession after their family, their home, for heaven's sake. 
   You really wonder what has been going on inside that administration,  what has been going on on Wall Street with people walking away with tens of millions of dollars in fees, and the American people's equity just being washed down the drain. 
   I recommend to the President that he go beyond appointing a person of high repute to the office of Secretary of HUD and have a strike team in the White House that can deal with every region of this country being so hard hit in this mortgage crisis. 
   Madam Speaker, I will include the articles for the Record.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE ASSURED FOOD SAFETY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, I'm introducing legislation to bring our food safety system into the 21st century by stopping the influx of unsafe food from countries like China. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the last several months, the American public has begun to tune in on an issue which should have every American at the edge of their seats, the danger of tainted food from abroad. Food imports are constituting a larger and larger share of what we eat and what is sold at stores across our Nation. 
   In 1996, our Nation had a huge positive agricultural trade balance of over $27 billion more exports going out than imports coming in. Today, that balance has dropped to only $8 billion, and we have wracked up enormous trade deficits of nearly $800 billion around the world, $230 billion with China. 
   With China constantly engaging in practices like unfairly manipulating their currency, the yuan, our agricultural trade policy is in dire need of change. For instance, individual shipments of food from China have recently been quoted as going from 82,000 shipments in 2002 to 199,000 in 2006. This is a staggering increase. Unless we act to protect our consumers, the United States will become dangerously dependent on foreign agricultural imports while our domestic market falters. 
   Take Chinese seafood imports. While they account for 22 percent of the domestic import market, Chinese goods account for 63 percent of seafood refused by inspectors at the border. Overall, Chinese food imports have quadrupled in 10 years, increasing from $880  million in 1996 to $4.2 billion in 2006. This increase of Chinese food imports over the last 10 years has not been followed by an equal increase of inspector activity. Therein lies the problem. Less than 2 percent of what comes over our border for human consumption is inspected. Yes, you heard me right, less than 2 percent. 
   As the Chinese share of American agricultural imports continues to grow, our domestic markets are impacted. For instance, unlike closely regulated domestic food additives, products like wheat gluten and vitamin C from China continue to flood our market. The last American vitamin C producer recently closed its doors, unable to compete against the flood of poorly regulated Chinese additives. So, when you take your vitamin pills, ask where the ingredients came from. 
   Earlier this year, Europe narrowly avoided disaster when a batch of vitamin A was contaminated with an additive which has caused infant deaths. Luckily, the additive was removed before it contaminated infant formula. 
   In a matter of weeks, the Chinese government went from denying the problems with their food chain to executing their lead food regulator and closing down almost 200 food factories. Estimates indicate that it will cost up to $100 billion over the next 10 years to build an infrastructure capable of certifying and protecting against Chinese agricultural goods. This should cause any American sitting down at the dinner table to think about drawing arms. We simply must do better. 
   And that is what my bill, the Assured Food Safety Act of 2007, does. It uses a simple approach and puts the burden of keeping food safe on the producers and the country of origin. The bill will require countries exporting food products to the United States to provide a certificate of assured safety for each class of items. If safe certified food is found to cause consumer illnesses or deaths, producers can be held liable through our Federal courts. Producers liable for damage they cause? What a sensible idea. 
   As a condition to accessing the American market, a producer must be willing to stand behind the quality of their product. Instead of relying on an inconsistent patchwork of international food standards, our consumers will be given the power to manage abuses directly through our legal system. 
   The United States government has a duty not only to protect the American population from the bad apples of the world but to restore the American people's confidence in the food we eat. Next time you go to the grocery store to buy pet food or pick up onions, remember our bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Assured Food Safety Act closes a serious loophole in our food safety regimen. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor our bill and help the American people regain confidence in our system.  
   It's Not Just Pet Food  
   Lost amid the anxiety surrounding the tainted U.S. pet food supply is this sobering reality: It's not just pet owners who should be worried. The uncontrolled distribution of low-quality imported food ingredients, mainly from China, poses a grave threat to public health worldwide. 
   Essential ingredients, such as vitamins used in many packaged foods, arrive at U.S. ports from China and, as recent news reports have underscored, are shipped without inspection to food and beverage distributors and manufacturers. Although they are used in relatively small quantities, these ingredients carry enormous risks for American consumers. One pound of tainted wheat gluten could, if undetected, contaminate as much as a thousand pounds of food. 
   Unlike imported beef, which is inspected at the point of processing by the U.S. Agriculture Department, few practical safeguards have been established to ensure the quality of food ingredients from China. 
   Often, U.S. officials don't know where or how such ingredients were produced. We know, however, that alarms have been raised about hygiene and labor standards at many Chinese manufacturing facilities. In China, municipal water used in the manufacturing process is often contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides and other chemicals. Food ingredient production is particularly susceptible to environmental contamination. 
   Equally worrisome, U.S. officials often lack the capability to trace foreign-produced food ingredients to their source of manufacture. In theory, the Bioterrorism Prevention Act of 2001 provides some measure of traceability. In practice, the act is ineffective and was not designed for this challenge. Its enforcement is also shrouded in secrecy by the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Even if Food and Drug Administration regulators wanted to crack down on products emanating from the riskiest foreign facilities, they couldn't, because they have no way of knowing which ingredients come from which plant. This is why officials have spent weeks searching for the original Chinese source of the contaminated wheat gluten that triggered the pet food crisis. 
   That it was pet food that got tainted--and that relatively few pets were harmed--is pure happenstance. Earlier this spring, Europe narrowly averted disaster when a batch of vitamin A from China was found to be contaminated with Enterobacter sakazakii, which has been proved to cause infant deaths. Thankfully, the defective vitamin A had not yet been incorporated into infant formula. Next time we may not be so fortunate. 
   Currently, most of the world's vitamins are manufactured in China. Unable to compete, the last U.S. plant making vitamin C closed a year ago. One of Europe's largest citric acid plants shut last winter, and only one vitamin C manufacturer operates in the West. Given China's cheap labor, artificially low prices and the unfair competitive climate it has foisted on the industry, few Western producers of food ingredients can survive much longer. 
   Western companies have had to invest heavily in Chinese facilities. These Western-owned plants follow strict standards and are generally better managed than their locally owned counterparts. Nevertheless, 80 percent of the world's vitamin C is now manufactured in China--much of it unregulated and some of it of questionable quality. 
   Europe is ahead of the United States in seeking greater accountability and traceability in food safety and importation. But even the European Union's ``rapid alert system'' is imperfect. Additional action is required if the continent is to avoid catastrophes. 
   To protect consumers here, we must revise our regulatory approaches. The first option is to institute regulations, based on the European model, to ensure that all food ingredients are thoroughly traceable. We should impose strict liability on manufacturers that fail to enforce traceability standards. 
   A draconian alternative is to mount a program modeled on USDA beef inspection for all food ingredients coming into the country. This regimen would require a significant commitment of resources and intensive training for hundreds of inspectors. 
   Food safety is a bipartisan issue: Congress and the administration must work together and move aggressively to devise stricter standards. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, has deplored dangerous levels of lead in vitamin products originating in China. We must get to the bottom of this pressing public health issue, without self-defeating finger-pointing. 
   The United States is sitting on a powder keg with uncontrolled importation and the distribution of low-quality food ingredients. Before it explodes--putting more animals and people at risk--corrective steps must be taken.

We see so much money going abroad, indeed billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, and these gentlemen have done something for our country, for our fundamental infrastructure, for transportation, and for housing, the most important investment any American has, their most important form of savings. 
   In the transportation area, I want to just focus in one area important to Ohio, and that is Amtrak. This bill is funded at a level of $1.4 billion. And the funding in this bill is providing critical capital and operating assistance to maintain our national passenger rail system in a manner that is environmentally friendly and necessary. No major industrial country in the world does not have a modern rail system. We need a ways to go in order to make ours better. This bill takes a step in that direction. Though President Bush and some of his allies in Congress were trying to kill passenger rail service in the country, they cannot succeed, because Amtrak is far too important for the Nation. 
   In 2006, more than 24 million passengers traveled on Amtrak. More than 67,000 passengers ride on up to 300 Amtrak trains per day. And just in our section of Ohio, 57,000 riders make their way through Toledo, Ohio, as a part of that. I wish we could do more for our high-speed rail corridors and for alternative fuels for the large trains. That is for the future, but at least we make investments in the fundamental system. 
   Secondly, in the area of housing, I'm really proud of what the committee has done, particularly to meet our Nation's most essential housing community development programs. Mayors around this country will appreciate the increase of nearly $1 billion above the President's request for the Community Development Block Grant program, the most important program for over 1,180 communities to get some of their tax dollars back to do what they must to run their own communities, their own cities.  
   In addition to that, housing for the elderly is maintained at $735 million, $160 million above the President's request. For every single available unit of affordable housing, there are 10 seniors on the waiting list. So we don't meet the need, but we take a step in the right direction. 
   Housing for the disabled is funded $236.6 million above the President's request. For U.S. housing markets which are in distress, in some areas literally dead in the water, HOPE VI is funded. The program is not killed to demolish deteriorating public housing, develop mixed-income housing and otherwise help revitalize our distressed neighborhoods. And importantly, the bill provides for proper administration and maintenance of our public housing stock. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this very well-balanced bill for investment in the United States of America. Isn't it time? 
   And again, thank you, Chairman Olver, for your fantastic work that touches every single corner of our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the chairman of the committee for bringing this important bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, the minimum wage is a women's working issue, and it is an issue for our children with over 1.4 million working mothers across this country who earn the minimum wage. 
   I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, what is it worth to you to have someone lift and bathe your elderly sick relative in a nursing home and empty their bed pans? Is it worth more than $5.15 an hour? 
   How about cleaning the bathrooms of the Democratic and Republican Conventions? People tend to not pay attention to those workers. How about washing dishes in restaurants across this country? How about caring for dozens and dozens of 3-year-olds in daycare centers across this Nation? How about those women that lift all those heavy trays at those restaurants that you all eat in, bringing food to the people across this Nation? Surely it is worth more than $5.15 an hour. 
   Even when it is raised to $7.25 an hour, if a woman has children, she is going to live in poverty anyway, so she has to work two jobs, most of them without health insurance. Preserve the value of work in this country. Vote for the increase in the minimum wage. It is the right thing to do.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3074, TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the chairman very much for the time, Chairman Olver and Ranking Member Knollenberg, for just a fantastic effort on this conference report. Let me say I rise in full support. 
   There are so many programs in it, such as our community development block grant program which helps over 1,180 communities across this country. We have been able to provide $3.79 billion in this bill, which is still, though responsible, $400 million less than we spent as a country in 2001, with many of our cities finding revenues on the decline or stuck because of the condition of the economy. So I know many of our mayors will welcome this. 
   I rise especially to point to the programs dealing with housing counseling, $250 million in this bill through the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, dollars to be disbursed within the next 60 days to help parts of the country that are just suffering so greatly because of the home mortgage foreclosure crisis. 
   There is no more important form of savings that any American family can have than their home. What has been happening across our country is we not only have a negative savings rate, but now we have a $1 trillion housing crisis in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their homes or are about to lose their homes. This $250 million that is included in this bill that will go through the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for counseling will help to try to allow some of these families to retain their homes as these mortgages are reset. 
   Frankly, I have been so disappointed in HUD's just sitting on the dime. As FEMA sat on the dime as people drowned in Louisiana, we've got people drowning all across this country because they're losing their homes and there's been no action. So we hope that this housing effort will make a big difference in helping them to be able to maintain their largest form of savings. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to mention the program for housing for special populations in this bill. There is a total of 7,500 vouchers for homeless veterans that are living in missions across this country, that are in our jails, that are on the streets. Surely we can do better than this as the American people. There are also 4,000 vouchers in the bill for the nonelderly disabled and another 4,000 vouchers for families with children, where children are separated from their families because the families have no housing. Ask yourself the question, how well will that child perform in school when their home situation is so uncertain that they don't even know where they're going to stay at night? 
   I think that this bill provides some important stimulus to the housing sector, and the funding that we have provided is certainly not enough in view of what we are facing as an economy as funds are drained away from our communities as a result of this subprime lending crisis, but at least we have done something in this bill to recognize that there ought to be dispatch in the subprime lending market, and if HUD can't do a very good job of it, then let's let the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation try to deal with these families that are dropping off the edge. I know that our mayors and those involved in housing for special populations will see this bill as a step forward. 
   I compliment the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for moving this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank Representative Inslee for taking this special order tonight on the very first night of the new Congress, the 110th Congress which is going to be so historic. And Speaker Pelosi's remarks today about energy independence for our country just rang so true. In a district like ours, which is a major new solar manufacturer, as well as wind turbine manufacturer and research region of the country. Coming from the auto belt, you don't think about that. But yet we are a biofuels leader. We  have four plants being built now, both soy diesel and corn-based ethanol within our radius of 25 miles of our major community of Toledo, and in fact, some of them right in Toledo. 
   And I wanted to just take a few minutes, if I might, and I thank Congressman Blumenauer and Congressman Holt. These gentlemen who are with us tonight are really the new age energy thinkers for our country, and I am really so happy to join you on this first night that we are here together. 
   And I just wanted to put on the record some interesting information that I have been sharing in the committees that I serve on. This particular chart talks about total petroleum consumption in our country, and looks at the growing share of imported petroleum as a percentage of everything that we consume. 
   And of course, since the beginning of the Bush administration, America is consuming one billion more barrels of oil per year, largely imported. Imports now constitute nearly three-quarters of what we use in this economy. Americans need to understand that. And over a period of time, from the beginning of the 90s, the share of imports has just risen until where now it comprises a majority of what we consume. This is a diminishing resource. Actually it is a dirty resource. 
   And I wish to place on the record tonight an article that was in The Financial Times back in December that lists the major companies in the world that are privately held. And I won't read the whole list tonight, except to say, of the top 20 companies, three-quarters are all oil companies, and they are not based in the United States. So all this money that the United States is spending on an imported product could be invested here at home in the new technologies that these fine gentlemen and I are talking about tonight. 
   Just to give you an idea, Saudi Aramco is number one on the list. Its value, estimated market value, is three-quarters of $1 trillion. $781 billion. And of course, Saudi Arabia has been a very important back up supplier to our country. I wish it were not so, but we have become very addicted to that supplier. 
   Petroleos Mexicanos, that oil and gas company worth $415 billion, our hard earned dollars flowing to that privately held company. 
   I won't go through all of them, but the next, Number 3 on the list, and the gentleman discussed Latin America, is Venezuelan Petroleum, valued at $388 billion. 
   Go down to Kuwait Petroleum, Number 4, $378 billion. Malaysian Petroleum, $232 billion. The idea is you go down and then you get into the companies financing this import, such as the Carlisle Group which has moved up now at $71 billion to Number 22 on the list. So I would like to submit this to the RECORD. The top three-quarters of these companies, the top 20 largest privately held companies in the world are all oil and gas. I wanted to make sure this was placed on the RECORD tonight, and to say that as the author of the first title in any farm bill in American history, a biofuels title, Title IX, we have been incentivizing at a very small level, about $23 million, not billion, $23 million dollars a year, efforts to try to help agriculturalists across this country own the future. It has been such a fight. And I heard the gentleman saying earlier this evening, finally, I think Mr. Blumenauer said, after 12 years, we finally have a chance to uncork this really developing answer for our Nation. And we hope that with the new farm bill and with the leadership of Congressman Colin Peterson, who is the right man at the right time in the right committee in the right country, from the Red River Valley of Minnesota, in the farm bill that will be produced this year, that we will be able to piece together the solutions that we know exist.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I will attest and sort of end with this. In our district today, Dr. Al Campaan, the head of Physics at the University of Toledo, has a solar-powered house from equipment made in Toledo. He takes his truck, with six batteries home, maybe eight, every night. He drives it from the university back home and he plugs it into his house. The technology exists in Toledo, Ohio. He drives it the next morning, a fully charged truck, back into the University of Toledo. 
   As we move to develop the technology of future, I would just recommend to those who are listening tonight, here in the Chamber and elsewhere, a wonderful book by a former decorated CIA agent, Robert Baer, for whom I have great admiration. He retired. He is in his 50s. We have probably had no better human intelligence officer throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. He wrote a book, Sleeping with the Devil.     
   When I read that book, I thought I have to meet this man, because he is speaking my language. The life he lived is very different than the life that we have lived, but he looked the problem straight in the eye. The subtitle of the book is: ``How Washington Became Addicted to Saudi Crude.'' 
   And I think it is important to note that the American people know this. They want us to do something. They want us to help transform the country. And I thank all my dear colleagues for allowing me these few minutes on the floor this evening. I was not intending to come here, but you have hit sort of the bull's eye of what this Member of Congress has been involved in for several years, and you could not be on a more important job creation, environmentally right set of initiatives for this country, and it will be a joy to be here working with you on this.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I want to agree with what the gentleman is saying, and look back at the last century, which was the century of hydrocarbons. This century will be the century of carbohydrates and unlocking the power of the carbohydrate molecule in a way we have never understood it before. 
   Those who came before us were on this track but got derailed from it. In the early part of the 20th century, in our district, we had a car that was kind of famous called the Clyde car. It was built by the Clyde Bicycle Works, and it was built around 1898 or 1902, somewhere in there. You see this Clyde car and you look at the steering wheel and it has two levers on it. One lever is for alcohol-based fuel. You know, they knew how to build stills back then. And the other is for petroleum-based fuel. And I have been amazed to open the trunk of the car and see two different fuel tanks and think, my gosh, how did we move from that, which was what the gentleman was talking about, choice at the pumps and choice of vehicles, and where we are today. Because certain people made certain choices. 
   I just mention that particular example and say that as our industries and our small businesses try to bring up these new technologies, what the gentlemen are saying tonight, Mr. Inslee, Mr. Blumenauer, and Mr. Holt about financing and the tax aspects of this, if you look at certain farmers in Ohio who have tried let's say to raise the capital to build a plant, amazing things are happening that are not so good out there. 
   The big buck players come in and they offer people on the board money so they never bring up that production, because there is an effort by those who are currently big buck dealers, in alcohol-based fuels, let's say, to want to control the market just like the oil companies are controlling the market. We see that some farmers do not have the organizational structure that they need in order to own some of this so that our rural communities across America will be able to find new value added and lift themselves to a new economic future. 
   I think, and I am not sure that everyone on the Agriculture Committee agrees with me on this yet, but we need some type of loan guarantee program or long-term financing in a structure like the Federal Land Banks or our Rural Electrics, which we started years ago, so that we have a system that is long term and permits them to stay in business so that some big buck operator does not come in, drive the price down in a given small market, and not permit them to be able to bring up and let this industry flower. 
   So the tax and financing aspects that we have been talking about are very, very important. 
   I also just wanted to say something about the science, as a member of the Agriculture Committee. It is amazing that in 2007, we do not know, in terms of row crop production, how to get the most yield out of a carbohydrate-based plant and a planting system that does the least damage to the atmosphere and yields the most combustible product.     
   For example, everyone is into ethanol from corn because we have subsidized corn up to here. But what about beans that have more oil? What about canola? What about castor? We stopped growing castor beans because of the by-product of ricin. But could we biogenetically take ricin out of castor beans and get more oil per acre? 
   We have got to do the science of planting, and we are just at the beginning of that age. We only have a glimmer of what that could be like. This is a major area for research where we could make a huge difference.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Congress is being pushed to pass a Bush administration plan to write a blank check to white collar criminals of the highest order. Instead of prosecuting those who stole from us, Secretary Paulson wants us to reward his former colleagues for their bad decisions, abusive and unlawful practices. 
   While my constituents are struggling to pay their gas bills, we should recall fondly the record annual bonuses Secretary Paulson's alma mater, Goldman Sachs, gave less than 2 years ago. In 2006, that investment house alone paid $16.5 billion in compensation to its employees averaging more than $600,000 per employee. In fact, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein got $53.4 million that year. And Bear Stearns chief executive officer, the company that the Fed just bailed out with our money, James E. Cayne, got a stock bonus that year worth $14.8 million. Merrill Lynch chief executive officer Stanley O'Neal, he got $35.4 million. Think about this America. 
   Now 2 years later, those houses are demanding that our taxpayers bail out their companies, despite the fact that the real median household income of a middle class family in our country is about $50,000 a year. That doesn't matter to the people drafting this bailout. 
   In 2006, Forbes Magazine estimated Secretary Paulson earned $16.4 million as CEO of Goldman Sachs, not counting all his other perks. His net worth is estimated somewhere over half a billion dollars. Indeed, that tidy amount alone would make a real dent in what is owed to the American people in this proposed bailout. 
   So why would our middle class taxpayers be asked to bail out billionaires? Some of them should be doing time for insider trading and fraudulent accounting rather than lobbying down here in Washington for us to bail them out. 
   American taxpayers were forced to lay out $30 billion to help Bear Stearns.     
   And then we were asked to shell out the first $200 billion, and that could rise to $2.44 trillion, for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And now, $85 billion to rescue AIG Insurance Company. 
   Who ever heard of the Federal Government rescuing an insurance company that was already paying, get this, civil fines in New York for its wrongdoing of over $1.6 billion on proven charges of serious accounting fraud and misconduct. 
   Why send our hardened paychecks to the very people who caused these problems? 
   Americans don't need to write checks. We need investigations, and we don't need just investigations, we need prosecutions. White collar crimes of this magnitude cannot go unpunished, nor can they get rewarded. 
   First, investigation. We need the American people's voices to be heard, not just the voices of those who perpetrated these crimes against us, the taxpayers. We need real congressional investigation and oversight in each of the committees of jurisdiction which seem strangely silent here, using their subpoena power, the Judiciary Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Budget Committee, the Financial Services Committee, which is having a perfunctory hearing tomorrow, I guess, and Government Oversight. The silence is deadening. 
   The crimes of Wall Street will make Watergate look like penny-ante thieves. 
   Second, campaign reform. Get the Wall Street money out of congressional and presidential races. Wall Street is now the Number 1 top source of Federal campaign money to Congress and in those presidential races. And guess who's the Number 1 Wall Street giver? Goldman Sachs. And guess where our last two Treasury Secretaries have come from? Goldman Sachs. 
   Whether it's a Democratic administration or a Republican, not one lawmaker or candidate should be accepting Wall Street money. Wall Street is so broke as to beg for our help, but somehow they have millions of dollars to drop into political coffers. 
   I think the American people are beginning to get the picture. In fact, I'm putting in the Record tonight an article from the Wall Street Journal called Wall Street Top Source of Campaign Money, and also a list of the biggest donors on Wall Street. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will continue tomorrow evening to talk about justice and empowering the Department of Justice to institute a major investigation. 
   And let me also, in closing say, I'm going to be placing in the Record tonight some remarks from Americans who have ideas about what should be done. 
   I want to compliment the American people. You're doing a lot of thinking on your own. We need to hear from you. 
   This Congress shouldn't be closing down and going home. We should be  taking care of America's business, not going home to campaign.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1591, U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the fine chairman of our Appropriations Committee, and say he would know that because he also is featured in the same magazine. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this first counteroffensive to the Bush administration's reckless approach to the global war on terrorism that has yielded an Iraqi civil war, over 3,200 U.S. dead, nearly 25,000 injuries, the evaporation of the coalition of the willing, tens of thousands of dead Iraqis, growing terrorism, hatred of America across the Islamic world, and shock and dismay among America's closest democratic allies globally. 
   The Bush administration has no answers. In fact, their budgets for this war reveal how lost at sea they are. Every single year they have asked for more in emergency add-ons than they planned to spend in the base budget bill itself. 
   Yet our brave troops fight on to hold the military edge. And this bill helps us fight harder for them by not asking them to bear the full burden of this war, because it sets a timetable for progress and requires the President to meet benchmarks he, himself, has set. 
   Our vote today funds our troops but, importantly, signals that victory means one-third military and two-thirds diplomacy and good governance and sets a timetable to get there, not  just militarily, but strategically and diplomatically.  
   If they knew what they were doing, these expenditures would have been built into the base budget, not afterthoughts. Look how out of touch they are with what was required: FY 2001 (Emergency Supplemental); $13.9 billion; FY 2002 (Supplemental): $3.4 billion; FY 2002 (Supplemental): $14.1 billion; FY 2003 (Supplemental): $66.0 billion; FY 2004 (Supplemental): $86.1 billion; FY 2005 (Supplemental): $79.0 billion; FY 2006 (Supp): $69.3 billion. 
   Additionally, there is the critical money appropriated by Congress that the Administration did not even think to ask for: FY 2005 Defense Appropriations Act: $25.7 billion; FY 2006 Defense Appropriations Act: $50 billion; FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Act: $70 billion. 
   Despite Congress voting all the funding that was requested, and even adding some additional where necessary, how is that our soldiers across the theatre don't have the right equipment? Just today, I received a call from an uncle of a Marine about to be deployed to Anbar Province: 
   ``His Kevlar vest isn't the right size, he has no visor to properly sync with his laser-guided weapon. The Marines are having to pay for supplies themselves like fire retardant gloves, duct tape, 550 cord, oil lubricants for the weapons, not enough boots, two sets of uniforms rather than the five they should be issued, and they are too big.'' 
   Our vote today funds our troops. But importantly signals that victory means 1/3 military and 2/3 diplomacy and good governance and sets a timetable to get there, not just militarily but strategically and diplomatically. 
   It falls to the Democrats to pick up the pieces of a failed foreign policy. And that is exactly what we are doing with this vote. No one here is operating under the illusion that we are presented with good choices. Importantly, this vote funds the troops we have in theatre. Although this bill holds the hope of redeploying our troops more effectively no later than a year from now, it continues to impose almost the entire burden of the mission in Iraq on our military. Meanwhile, U.S. policy is exacerbating terrorism and begetting violence that could spill over into Jordan, Turkey, Bahrain, Kuwait, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia--all while the Afghan war is becoming more challenging. 
   Whatever happened to the coalition of the willing? 
   Where are the neighbors of Iraq? 
   Where are the diplomats to address the Israel-Palestinian standoff? 
   In Egypt, 70 percent of the public unfavorably views the United States. In Jordan, U.S. favorability has fallen to 15 percent. In Saudi Arabia, from where the majority--9-11 terrorists emerged, the U.S. is disliked by 76 percent of it citizens. Gallup polls tell us why: America is viewed as not on the side of rising popular expectations for a more democratic way of life. The United States is viewed as a promiscuous culture in moral decay. Abu Ghraib affirmed them in their views. 
   Granted, no single vote here will quickly repair the damage to our nation's prestige, mend the broken hearts, or put back together the broken lives of thousands of American and Iraqi families. 
   No single vote will invigorate Iraq's neighbors to promote regional stability. 
   No single vote will win the war on terrorism. 
   No single vote will free America from her dangerous dependency on imported oil from dictatorships. 
   America faces a strategic challenge much larger than Iraq. It requires aligning America on the side of democratic dreams of underprivileged people, not just the super-rich, in the vast undemocratic places where terrorists are being spawned. The Bush Administration's proclivity to support the aristocrats of the world at the expense of everyone else is raining havoc down on our world as Big Oil lines up to pump out Iraq's oil--Exxon Mobil, Conoco Phillips, Chevron Texaco, even foreign companies as Total, Royal Dutch Shell, and BP. 
   I am not entirely comfortable with this vote. 
   I imagine no Member is entirely comfortable with spending another $100 billion, on top of $379 billion, on the war in Iraq, a war that has now lasted longer than World Wars I and II combined. 
   In my congressional district in Northern Ohio, communities are struggling to revive an unresponsive economy. Families are having trouble making ends meet. 
   In Ohio, we desperately need new roads and bridges and sewers. We need health care and education. But the Bush Administration is obsessed with Iraq. Billions of dollars for Iraq--pennies for Ohio. We are shortchanging our citizens and our children in the name of a failed policy. 
   This vote, however, marks the beginning of the end of the Bush Administration's colossal foreign policy debacle. 
   Our vote today will ensure a beginning to an end of this failed foreign policy that decouples our military from a failed foreign policy, of the immense drain on our purse, an end to the injuries to, and deaths of, our brave soldiers. And an end to the growing disrespect of our great country in every corner of the world. 
   I have opposed this war from the beginning. I said on this same floor in October 2002 that war against Iraq ``will not make America safer, because unilateral military action without broad international support will isolate America further. It will thrust us into the position of becoming a common enemy in a volatile region where anti-western terrorism grows with each passing year. It will not make the region more stable either. The Bush approach will yield more terrorism and instability, not less.'' 
   How I wish that I could say I was wrong in 2002. 
   But what I feared most has come to pass. 
   In December 2005, General Abizaid said: ``The battle against Al Qaeda will not be primarily military. It will be political, economic and ideological. If you look at the geography of Al Qaeda, there is not a place to put a military solution.'' 
   Since returning from Iraq, I have repeated what Generals Petraeus and Odierno said to us: ``Victory is one-third military, two-thirds diplomacy and good governance.'' America has focused all of our efforts on our military campaign, while the Commander-in-Chief has failed to support our soldiers with diplomatic and political efforts to wrap around their operations. Instead, these valiant men and women fall victim to a Commander-In-Chief who has not only bungled the war on terrorism, but utterly failed in his role as Diplomat-In-Chief for our nation. He is isolating America. Why should our soldiers bear the heavy burden of winning when the good governance piece is completely absent? 
   President Bush refuses to listen, refuses to change course. His obstinate attitude is shocking. 
   I am voting for this supplemental precisely because it turns up the pressure on President Bush and forces him to account for his disastrous strategy. The status quo is not an option. 
   This war must end. Although this emergency supplemental spending bill is not a perfect solution to this vast problem, the legislation points the way to a long-overdue course correction. 
   It is important to note: it does so without endangering the courageous and patriotic soldiers serving us in the Middle East. It is an exquisite response to the false choices the Bush Administration specializes in offering to us.

The Defense subcommittee held over 30 hearings this year, nearly double that of the previous Congress. We received testimony from dozens of witnesses--from both inside and outside the Department of Defense--in order to allow the Members and our extraordinary staff to fashion this well balanced bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, this has been a difficult year for our Nation. The economy is in fragile shape, the public is losing faith in this body and the war in Iraq is taking a serious toll on the morale and well being of U.S. soldiers. As this conflict extends well into its 5th year, I must soberly remind each and every Member of this body that 3,651 U.S. soldiers have been killed and 27,104 injured. Those are staggering numbers. 
   Thankfully, this bill seeks to provide robust funding for those programs most important to the soldiers and to their families. The Committee fully-funded a 3.5 percent military pay raise without charging higher health care fees for military retirees, as the Administration proposed to do. Included in this bill is just under three billion dollars for family advocacy programs, childcare centers and dependent's education programs. 
   I am also very supportive of strong language and related funding in this bill providing for increased oversight and accountability of contractors and contracting out services. We have been calling on the Department of Defense to get its fiscal house in order for years. They chose to ignore Congress. This bill provides much needed guidance on the steps they must take to increase transparency on how they spend the public's money. Corruption and fiscal irresponsibility cannot stand. I agree with my Chairman, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, who maintains: ``The Committee's fiduciary responsibility to the American taxpayer requires holding accountable organizations, officials, and programs that have performed poorly. Moreover, wasted resources and procedural abuses ultimately come at the expense of our military men and women.'' As a result, we provide increased funds for the Contract Audit Agency, the Contract Management Agency, and the Department of Defense Inspector General. We also provide authority for the DoD to hire up to 500 GSA and GAG efficiency experts for assistance. 
   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I want to draw each Member's attention to language in this bill that notes the Department of Defense has been slow ``to establish aggressive goals and timelines to achieve increased energy efficiency.'' The utter dependence of the United States on imported petroleum creates the major strategic vulnerability for our Nation, coupled with nearly half of the energy supply of the United States dependent on foreign sources. From the economically damaging Arab oil embargoes of 1973-74 and 1979 to the current recession precipitated by rising oil prices, which began in 1999, economic forces outside our borders have too often shaken the economic stability of the United States. We must shift America's dependence away from foreign petroleum as an energy source toward alternative, renewable, domestic sources. We must aim to balance the current petroleum trade deficit by replacing foreign sources of supply with steady increases of domestically-produced fuels and power system. 
   The Department of Defense is the largest purchaser of fuel in the United States. It maintains the largest energy footprint in our Govemment. I believe the Department of Defense can and must lead all other agencies in making the United States energy independent again. 
   I encourage every Member to vote in favor of this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND SYMPATHY FOR VICTIMS OF DEVASTATING FLOODING THAT OCCURRED IN OHIO -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Thank you distinguished Chairman LYNCH, and my dear friend from our delegation Congressman JIM JORDAN. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in support of House Resolution 728, which speaks to the issue of the flooding throughout Ohio in August of this year. 
   Congressman Jordan and I stood shoulder to shoulder with the late Congressman Paul Gillmor in Findlay to survey the devastating 100-year flood level. This flooding ripped through the heart of many small towns in northwest Ohio, burying our communities in feet of mud and water while washing away the dreams of so many today. 
   We know there are probably over $100 million worth of damages. We owe so much to all the emergency workers--to the fire, to the police, to the local officials like Mayor Iriti, who I thought, did an outstanding job--for trying to address this situation, which wasn't any of their fault or our fault. You had 15 inches of rain within 24 hours; and this flood truly was different. 
   Instead of simply devastating our community, the flood also sent a shock wave through all of us on the challenge of fresh water management that our region, our very flat region, faces. 
   It is ironic that in Ohio we were talking about too much water at a time when, now, Georgia and the southeastern States are experiencing record droughts. We know in our region the status quo is not acceptable. We were very pleased that Secretary Chertoff joined us and offered the continuing help of FEMA to address the damage from these floods in August. We knew that our region had potential water management problems. But we never thought they would come now so quickly. We had launched a watershed management partnership in the Western Lake Erie Basin to handle the growing levels of storm water runoff. 
   The Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have driven forward a remarkable partnership that is unique in its scope anywhere in the country for what it is trying to accomplish. At the center of this assessment is the understanding that we must better manage our fresh water asset for the future. 
   It is our competitive advantage, without question, in the Great Lakes States. We have been buffeted in our region by globalization, but we will not give up our greatest asset. We know we must manage it with a comprehensive basinwide solution. 
   I think this flooding was a real clarion call to people in our region. We saw the levels of damage and now having to remediate after the fact. But had we had in place structures and systems to handle this level of water, we would not have had the level of damage that we experienced. We know that the level of rainfall was extraordinarily large, but the point is, we were not properly prepared for it, and we have now had this clarion call. 
   We were very fortunate that the loss of life was minimized, but, nonetheless, people are still digging out. I think this resolution is a very important step forward as we try to handle this precious global asset of fresh water in our region in a much, much wiser way so that we can avoid the flooding of the future. 
   Even Marathon Oil had eight feet of water in its corporate headquarters in Findlay, Ohio. Business leaders, the chamber, a broad band of public officials and private sector leadership across the region recognize we can't go through this again. We have to think about dry dams. We have to think of reservoirs. We have to think of ways to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage and put those dollars to work avoiding that kind of disaster in the future. 
   In recognizing all of those who helped to handle this enormous tragedy that befell our area, we also look to the future and the fact that we have the Western Lake Erie Basin partnership as a building block toward the future in order to make the future better than the past and to learn the lessons that history has now taught us. 
   I am very pleased to join my colleagues here today, Congressman Lynch, who has taken such great leadership on this measure. We, in Ohio, appreciate the response of all the emergency personnel who did so very much, and to the people who suffered, and also to Congressman JIM JORDAN for bringing this to the floor today. We are joined hand in hand as we move forward together in northern Ohio to better manage our fresh water asset for future generations.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TIME TO WAKE UP ON THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this week, ExxonMobil reported it beat its own record for the highest annual profits ever recorded by any company with its net income rising to $40.6 billion in 2007, the highest record profits of any company in American history. Those profits are due to the surging oil and gasoline prices that we are all paying. Meanwhile, here in Washington, the establishment sits around the table in anticipation of the President's budget proposal. Lobbyists, advocates, lawmakers, and agency heads wait in anticipation. 
   This year it seems that the President has outdone himself by pushing up our national debt to $9.2 trillion, nearly $10 trillion. When President Bush took office, gasoline cost $1.45 a gallon. When he took office, gasoline cost $1.45 and we were showing surpluses after the discipline we had exacted here during the 1990s, surpluses in our budget of $5.6 trillion. Now gasoline regularly rises above $3 a gallon and the annual budget is in the red, his latest budget as submitted by over $407 billion, and you know it is going to rise to over half a trillion dollars with the war costs. 
   What a story. While the Nation goes deeper into the red with higher gas prices and bigger deficits, oil companies are making out like bandits. Compare a $407 billion budget deficit for our country with $40.6 billion in exorbitant profits taken in by ExxonMobil in 2007. ExxonMobil posted the largest profit in U.S. history, sucking those dollars from our people.  
   While we are considering a stimulus package to jump-start our economy, imagine how solving our tremendous energy crisis could help every single American. We are talking about sending pennies to some Americans in this so-called stimulus package, while these giants are running off with billions and billions and billions of dollars. Where is the courage of this Congress to balance these accounts and to make sure that those who need help in our country actually get it? 
   If you add up the President's budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers, the Small Business Administration, the Department of Labor, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce, and the entire Environmental Protection Agency, it costs $2 billion less to run them all than ExxonMobil made in 2007. Think about that. 
   Let's think about what it means for our Nation's priorities. It is more important for ExxonMobil to make billions than it is for us to conduct scientific research or to clean up the environment or to extend unemployment benefits or to help businesses in this economy, small businesses try to survive, to fix up our levees and our bridges and our roads? 
   Think about the millions of Americans we could help who are facing a meltdown in the housing market and losing their most important form of savings. Think about the nearly 200,000 homeless veterans living on the streets of our country. What an embarrassment. Think about the 33.5 million Americans that are food insecure and regularly go to bed hungry as our food pantries run dry. 
   It is often said that a budget is the real show of a nation's values. When President Bush complains about how America is addicted to oil in his State of the Union but then fails to move our Nation to energy independence, we sure know where his values fall. When our society allows our oil barons to make off with billions, skimmed away from the American people, we know where those loyalties lie. 
   With oil prices continuing to rise, the high price of gasoline continues to fuel our trade deficits. With oil prices as high as $98 a barrel last year, the monthly trade deficit from oil rose to a level rarely seen, $24 billion just in November of 2007. 
   We all know that this FY 2009 proposed Bush budget is an empty shell from a lame duck President, but somehow we had expected more. Congress should reject the President's proposed budget and rewrite it in a way that protects the American consumer, invests in energy independence, and provides a real stimulus for the American economy at a time when the American people are crying for it. 
   Millions and millions of Americans are losing their homes, their most important form of savings. When is this Congress and when is this President going to wake up? 
   Madam Speaker, I include the following for the Record.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this excellent bill to support food, fiber, fuel and forest production across this Nation.  
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Chairwoman Ms. DELAURO, a longstanding colleague, for the excellent bill she has assembled. As the former ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, it has been a pleasure to see my colleague bring together our subcommittee through a form of collegiality unrivaled in this day of partisanship. This year's agriculture appropriations bill has been many years in coming, investing in the critical resources necessary to move agriculture and much of rural America fully into the 21st Century. 
   Ms. DELAURO has been a true leader and has produced a bill that should make all members of the Subcommittee proud. This bill invests in energy independence, secures our Nation's food supply, provides nutritional assistance for those living on the edge and link production from local small farmers with our urban consumers. The bill helps to grow America's economy through investing in rural America's potential for food, fiber, fuel and forest production. 
   Along with breakthrough investments in energy that will result from the recent farm bill, this measure moves America forward with a plan to use agriculture to solve our energy crisis. This legislation provides $350 million for biomass and renewable energy projects and $500 million to electrify America with wind power. This bill also provides $46 million for an innovative USDA grant program to help America transition to renewable energy sources, a program that has a long record of investing in the technologies of tomorrow. Agriculture holds the key if we are going to wean our Country from our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. This bill provides important incentive to transition us into the economy of tomorrow. 
   The Department of Agriculture dedicates almost 2/3 of its budget to nutrition, yet, there have been scarce few attempts to link local producers with urban consumers. This bill confronts those challenges and directs the Department of Agriculture to connect local farmers with procurement from USDA major nutrition programs. In addition, this bill also provides $20 million for the senior farmers market nutrition program, an approach so wildly successful with the elderly and with farmers that it regularly has more requests than funds available. For our Nation's farmers markets, this bill also provides $1,000,000 for the Farmers' Market Promotion Program to establish, expand, and promote farmers' markets to connect local production to the local marketplace. 
   I am also pleased to rise in support of the $150 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program that this legislation provides. This bill provides enough money to expand CSFP in 5 new states, providing a food supplement for those who cannot make ends meet. 
   These agriculture nutrition programs bridge the gap between urban and rural, linking consumers with local producers--helping to provide fresh produce, vegetables and commodities to those with little access to nutritious foods. 
   On food safety, this bill confronts critical challenges to the integrity of our food system. This bill blocks implementation of a rule which  would allow poultry importation 
   from China and provides funds to implement the long awaited process of labeling the country of origin for food in our marketplace. It has taken many years to bring this issue to the forefront. But now it appears that Congress is finally giving consumers the tools for making effective decisions on what they choose to eat. 
   Before I close, I would like to advise the administration of language which clearly expresses the intent of Congress on the failed policy of Farm Service Agency closures. In both the Agriculture Appropriations bill and in the recently passed Farm Bill, the House of Representatives expressed its discontent with efforts to move forward with these closures. As there seems to be significant confusion on the intent of Congress on Farm Service Agency office closures, I respectfully refer the FSA Administration to two sections in recent legislation passed in the House of Representatives which clearly provide the intent of Congress on this issue. 
   In H.R. 2419 Section 11306 and Page 56 of the House Appropriations Report from H.R. 3161 clearly express the intent of Congress. As FSA moves forward with office closures in Ohio and across the Country, I strongly urge the administration to recognize the clear intent of the House Appropriations Committee, the House Agriculture Committee and the full House of Representatives. 
   In sum, this bill takes a major step forward for our Nation in opening new markets for farmers, makes major strides in conservation of our natural resources, attends to the food needs of all of America's needy families and children, moves rural America into renewable energy production, addresses challenges posed by serious environmental invasive species, and expands our food safety efforts. America must dedicate itself to food self sufficiency here at home and displace the rising levels of food imports. This bill invests in our Nation and our producers and consumers. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the gentleman's amendment and to allow the importation of safe prescription drugs into our country. 
   You know, the pharmaceutical companies are making record profits. I represent a district along the Canadian border. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sick people from our district have to drive up over that bridge, the Windsor Bridge, up into Canada in order to take care of their mentally ill kids. The senior citizens that can't afford drugs, or they've been thrown out of a job, to try to keep house and home together as they have to purchase various pharmaceutical products. 
   What do we have an FDA for if it isn't for certification? That's what we want them to do. These drugs are being bought from certified pharmacies. 
   You know, the seniors that come through the supermarket aisle in the place where I shop back home, they're choosing between food and medicine. What kind of a choice is that, really? 
   You don't have to buy unsafe drugs. You can buy safe drugs. We want the FDA to regulate. I'd prefer to see drug prices reach an affordable level in our Nation and to make sure that all of our people have full prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and that's the direction we ought to move, including drug coverage under our insurance programs. 
   But there's absolutely no reason to buy the red herring that if you buy pharmaceuticals in Canada they're not safe. There isn't a single person in my district that has ever gotten sick, because they go to certified pharmacies.  The tragedy is they cannot afford those drugs in this country. 
   And I want to compliment Congresswoman DeLauro, who has fought on this, Congresswoman Emerson, who has fought on this. It seems like we keep fighting this because the pharmaceutical companies keep fighting us to do what's right for this country.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I thank Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS from California for bringing us together here and for her great leadership in the Out of Iraq Caucus. And I also thank Congressman DENNIS KUCINICH of Ohio for his great intellect and great passion. It is a joy to serve with all of you. 
   I made more formal remarks earlier this evening on the subject of the President's proposal to escalate the number of troops in Iraq. But I wanted to spend a couple of minutes this evening reemphasizing the broader region and how U.S. policy is really impacting a growing anti-Americanism not just inside Iraq, but in many other countries, and how the United States is serving to create destabilization inside nations that is very, very dangerous for those countries, yet we play an immense role in that. 
   We see what has happened in Iraq. That is kind of the prism that we are looking through now, and we see the Sunni and Shia pitted against each other, and Christians fleeing across the border by the hundreds of thousands, thinking they have no more home inside Iraq. We have done a lot of damage in that country. 
   And then we look at what is happening inside nations like Bahrain. In recent parliamentary elections, we saw that almost a dozen, 20 parliamentarians were elected from very, very anti-American postures. And, of course, our Fifth Fleet is ported in Bahrain. Were it not ported there, I doubt that the Government of Bahrain would hold. 
   We look at what is happening in Pakistan and in the provinces of Pakistan. And in every single one of those provinces, the most anti-American candidates are being elected to and rising within the political structure of those countries. 
   We think about what just happened at the Horn of Africa, and we look at Ethiopia and the arms that the United States is providing and the soldiers that have entered into Somalia and our gunships shelling off of the coast into Somalia itself and the conflict that is brewing between Ethiopia and Somalia. 
   And you begin looking at what is happening in the general region. It isn't just Iraq. That is kind of a place where we need to keep our eye, but we need to open our eyes to what is happening across the region. 
   Inside of Lebanon, a country that I remain very close to because of the constituency that I represent, and the struggles we have had during our tenure here in the Congress to try to help Lebanon to be a leader in terms of signing the peace agreement with Israel and remaining a major center for education, for trade, for business, for diplomacy in that part of the world, and the United States standing back and allowing Lebanon to be shelled around its entire perimeter, and a most unfortunate war between Lebanon and Israel, and we saw the Bush administration sit back. 
   And then we watch these demonstrations in the streets of Beirut. I mean, a million people from Hezbollah demonstrating against the United States. And then of course the Government of Lebanon, Prime Minister Siniora's government trying to hold on, trying to maintain a posture where all sects are able to participate. 
   But if you look at what is happening across the region in almost every single country, there is this destabilization. 
   In the Palestinian Authority where we thought during the Clinton administration we were making some progress, of course difficult, of course painstaking. Yet we see Hamas clashing in so many countries. What we have is destabilization rather than a movement toward reconciliation. 
   The policies of the Bush administration almost seem to result in destabilization in many, many countries in that region of the world. 
   In Afghanistan, we know that our work is cut out for us. Afghanistan in many ways is a capital without a country, and we are seeing the loss of more life from soldiers from the international community that are attempting to assist us to try to bring some functioning nation-state in place in Afghanistan. 
   I mention these issues because the President of the United States doesn't. He acts like they are not there. And the rising anti-Americanism that we see across the broader region is very, very dangerous. It is dangerous 
   not perhaps so much for my generation, but for our children and grandchildren that will follow us. There are 1 billion people who subscribe to Islam in this world, and we have to not alienate every single one of them. We have to help them reconcile their internal differences, their tribal tendencies, their tendencies to talk across one another rather than with one another. 
   I would like to thank my colleague for allowing me a few minutes this evening. I could speak about the oil imperative and my deep, deep concerns about what is happening not just inside Iraq but with the powerful, powerful involvement of global oil companies in letting their power be felt in what happens in this capital and with the likely placements of pipelines across the regions that I am talking about and who are likely to be winners and losers in those efforts. There isn't time to do that tonight. 
   Without question, the United States, when people ask what can we do at home, what we should be doing here at home is becoming energy independent within a decade. No question. No  blinks, no hesitation, no doubts. Not by 2025, within one decade, because that would help free America from the bondage that we are held to from all of the dictatorships from whom we are importing oil. And those dictatorships are extremely important for the American to understand. 
   If you really look at where terrorism sprouts from, where did the majority of the 9/11 terrorists come from: Saudi Arabia. Why would they hit the United States? What might that have to do with? Where did they come from in Saudi Arabia, and what were they trying to do? 
   They were trying to get us out of Saudi Arabia. And you know what, they succeeded in doing that. We moved our forces out. 
   They are about the task of cleansing, in their view, their part of the world from those who control those important oil resources. The United States shouldn't be joined at the hip to oil dictatorships. The American people are beginning to understand who really controls rising oil and gasoline prices in this country, and the importance of us becoming energy independent here at home. 
   We need to focus the American people on what is happening across a broad region of the world that is extremely dangerous to us long term as the Bush policies are so narrowly focused and really counterproductive long term.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICA NEEDS A FOREIGN POLICY THAT DOES NOT PUT THE INTERESTS OF OIL AND OIL DICTATORSHIPS ABOVE THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, America needs a foreign policy that does not put the interests of oil and oil dictatorships above the interests of human life. It is not surprising that I don't support the escalation of U.S. troop levels in Iraq as asked for by our President last night. 
   President Bush cannot lead America to military victory in Iraq, absent a viable, political solution that puts Iraq's internal affairs back together and redeploys our soldiers out of the role of being an occupying force. His statement is 3 years too late and hundreds of thousands of soldiers short. 
   The President refuses to see that his strategy to combat terrorism is transforming Iraq into an Islamic Shi'a state with the relegation of the Sunni and the escape of Christians. Is this lop-sided result really in the interests of regional peace long term? Why should our U.S. forces, the President says he wants to deploy to Baghdad and Anbar Province, be used to do the cleanup work for the new Shi'a-led government. The growing insurgency inside Iraq, and any American sentiment both inside and outside of Iraq, will not be quelled by sending more U.S. troops. It will ripen it. 
   There is now only one choice: Iraq must take responsibility for its own security as part of a broader political solution that works. But how can that political solution work when minorities in Iraq feel so underrepresented? That is why the international community and Iraq's neighbors must, no matter how difficult, become engaged in diplomatic efforts. 
   Throughout the Muslim and Persian worlds, the President's policies have emboldened anti-American leaders in Lebanon, in Iran, in Syria, in Bahrain, in the Palestinian Authority, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, in Pakistan, even the Horn of Africa now. The Bush doctrine of preemptive war, test marketed in Iraq, succeeded in deposing Saddam Hussein and determining whether or not he possessed weapons of mass destruction. 
   It is time, therefore, for the President and us to declare victory and transform the operation. As decorated CIA intelligence officer Robert Baer has written: ``We are at war in America and throughout the Western world, at war with an enemy with no infrastructure to attack, with no planes to shoot out of the sky, with no boats to sink to the bottom of the seas, and precious few tanks to blow up for the amusement of viewers of CNN.'' 
   Baer contends the only way to defeat such a faceless enemy is by substantial increases in human intelligence, and I agree. But that intelligence has been lacking. Even in the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, almost no one speaks Arabic. Dr. Edward Luttwak, a strategic affairs expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, observed that the U.S. general who led the operation to apprehend Osama bin Laden neither spoke Arabic nor showed any interest in learning it and depended upon translations of intercepts to detect him. 
   Importantly, we can ask ourselves, after 5 years, why hasn't the administration filled that human intelligence gap so fundamental to success. Maybe they really don't want to know. So now with the President's proposal to accelerate more forces, those units are going to deploy with too few personnel or with significant numbers of new personnel. 
   This decreases unit cohesiveness and individual proficiency. Many units are facing three or more deployments, far beyond what was originally anticipated. We know that previous escalation of troops in Iraq have yielded no more success. Without a political solution the President cannot hold the ground by dispatching more U.S. groups or by continuing his escalation of the employment of greater and greater numbers of unaccountable, contracted forces and mercenaries to compensate for the lack of security and rising anti-Americanism. 
   Our military's time-honored values of duty, honor, and country are being eviscerated by an operation that is depending more and more on hired guns  to police the streets, on bounty-seeking contractors to guard important sites such as the oil wells, and foreign nationals to carry out internal security operations in Iraq. I don't call that the freedom the President talked about last night. 
   Iraqis have proposed dividing Baghdad into nine sectors and policing them with Iraqi troops as American soldiers are redeployed as backups. That might work. But the U.S. most of all needs a broad political strategy that addresses the rising levels of global terrorism the Bush policy is yielding and the growing anti-American sentiment that is brewing in Iraq and the Muslim world beyond. 
   That strategy demands significant new human intelligence networks, not standing armies. Moreover, we need international diplomacy to engage all nations that border Iraq to seek a resolution to the strife. 
   Mr. Speaker, America needs a foreign policy that does not put the interests of oil and oil dictatorships above the value of human life. Just as the Bush administration took office, this country is importing an additional 1 billion more barrels of oil per year. Tell me there is no connection between our utter dependence on imported petroleum and the deployment of our precious troops to the Middle East and Central Asia.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, since 2000, our Nation has lost over 3,400,000 more manufacturing jobs. In fact, the job creation record of the Bush administration is the worst since the Hoover administration. 
   The figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor last week posted the largest job loss in 5 years. The report was much weaker than expected, and, strangely, the unemployment rate declined because there were fewer people in the workforce. CNN's Moneyline reported that employers made their deepest cuts in staffing in almost 5 years in February. There was a net loss of 63,000 more jobs, which is the biggest decline since March 2003, and weaker than the revised 22,000 job loss reported for January. The job loss was widespread, reaching beyond the battered construction industry, which lost 39,000 jobs, and manufacturing, where job losses hit 52,000. 
   Retailers cut 34,000 jobs while business and professional service cut 20,000 jobs. Temporary staffing firms cut nearly 28,000 jobs off their payrolls, another warning sign of employers pulling back, and hotels cut about 4,000 jobs, a sign that discretionary consumer spending could be on the wane. Overall, the private sector cut over 101,000 jobs according to the CNN Moneyline report. 
   The widening recession in almost every sector, not just the goods-producing sector, is extraordinarily important. I wish to place those numbers in the Record and say, Madam Speaker, America needs to create more real wealth here at home and stop borrowing prosperity and piling on more debt. We need to create jobs leading to energy independence in this country. We need to do more than just sort of flash our hand at that and be serious about it. 
   We need new transportation systems in our country. We need new bridges in the ground. We need people to be employed, those who now are idle labor, in helping to build back our economy from coast to coast. 
   A real stimulus package would lead our Nation to invest here at home, not just to borrow more from abroad. These numbers are serious omens. They're warning signs to those who have responsibility here in Washington to do more than manipulate interest rates. They would engage this Congress in an effort to build forward again in those sectors that would leave future generations real wealth, the kind of wealth that our ancestors left us: libraries, schools, highways, bridges, new energy systems, clean water systems, new transportation systems, new high-speed rail, new air control towers; the kind of wealth that can't be outsourced that belongs to the American people for generations to come. 
   Madam Speaker, I place in the Record the figures from the CNN Moneyline report about what happened with the biggest job loss in 5 years in this past quarter.

   Rule one: Rush the decision. Time the game to fall in the week before Congress is set to adjourn and just 6 weeks before an historic election so your opponents will be preoccupied, pressured, distracted, and in a hurry. 
   Rule two: Disarm the public through fear. Warn that the entire global financial system will collapse and the world will fall into another Great Depression. Control the media enough to ensure that the public will not notice this. 
   Bailout will indebt them for generations, taking from them trillions of dollars they earned and deserve to keep. 
   Rule three: Control the playing field and set the rules. Hide from the public and most of the Congress just who is arranging this deal. Communicate with the public through leaks to media insiders. Limit any open congressional hearings. Communicate with Congress via private teleconferencing calls. Heighten political anxiety by contacting each political party separately. Treat Members of Congress condescendingly, telling them that the matter is so complex that they must rely on those few insiders who really do know what's going on. 
   Rule four: Divert attention and keep people confused. Manage the news cycle so Congress and the public have no time to examine who destroyed the prudent banking system that served America so well for 60 years after the financial meltdown of the 1920s. 
   Rule five: Always keep in mind the goal is to privatize gains to a few and socialize loss to the many. For 30 years in one financial scandal after another, Wall Street game masters have kept billions of dollars of their gain and shifted their losses to American taxpayers. Once this bailout is in place, the greed game will begin again. 
   But I have a counter-game. It's called Wall Street Reckoning. Congress shouldn't go home to campaign. It should put America's accounts in order.     
   To Wall Street insiders, it says ``no'' on behalf of the American people. You have perpetrated the greatest financial crimes ever on this American republic. You think you can get by with it because you are extraordinarily wealthy and the largest contributors to both Presidential and congressional campaigns in both major parties, but you are about to be brought under firm control. 
   First, America doesn't need to bail you out, it needs to secure the real assets and property, not your paper, that means the homes and properties of hardworking Americans who are about to lose their homes because of your mortgage greed. There should be a new job for regional Federal Reserve Banks. We want no home foreclosed if a serious work-out agreement can be put into place. And if you don't do it, we want a notarized statement by a Federal Reserve official that they tried and failed. 
   Second, taxpayers should directly gain any equity benefits that may flow from this historic bailout. We want the American people to get first priority in taking ownership of the institutions that want to pass their toxic paper onto the taxpayers. 
   Third, before any bailouts for Wall Street, America needs major job creation to rebuild our major infrastructure. America needs assets, not paper. We need working assets. 
   Fourth, the time for real financial regulatory change is now, not next year. A modernized Glass Eagle Act must be put in place. We need to reestablish locally-owned community savings banks across this country and create within the Justice Department a fully funded unit to prosecute every single high-flying thief whose fraud and criminal acts created this debacle and then forced their disgorgement of assets going back 15 years. 
   Fifth, any refinancing must return a major share of profits to a new Social Security and Medicare lockbox, where the monies can go to pay for a dignified and assured retirement for every American. This Member isn't voting for a penny of it. Those who created and profited from this game of games must be brought to justice. The assets they stole must be returned to the American taxpayers, right down to the tires on their Mercedes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill to create an independent commission to investigate these well-heeled wrongdoers. Real reform now, or nothing. 
   Seven Deadly Sins of Deregulation--and Three Necessary Reforms  
   The current carnage on Wall Street, with dire spillover effects on Main Street, is the result of a failed ideology--the idea that financial markets could regulate themselves. Serial deregulation fed on itself. Deliberate repeal of regulations became entangled with failure to carry out laws still on the books. Corruption mingled with simple incompetence. And though the ideology was largely Republican, it was abetted by Wall Street Democrats. 
   Why regulate? As we have seen ever since the sub-prime market blew up in the summer of 2007, government cannot stand by when a financial crash threatens to turn into a general depression--even a government like the  Bush administration that fervently believes in free markets. But if government must act to contain wider damage when large banks fail, then it is obliged to act to prevent damage from occurring in the first place. Otherwise, the result is what economists term ``moral hazard''--an invitation to take excessive risks. 
   Government, under Franklin Roosevelt, got serious about regulating financial markets after the first cycle of financial bubble and economic ruin in the 1920s. Then, as now, the abuses were complex in their detail but very simple in their essence. They included the sale of complex securities packaged in deceptive and misleading ways; far too much borrowing to finance speculative investments; and gross conflicts of interest on the part of insiders who stood to profit from flim-flams. When the speculative bubble burst in 1929, sellers overwhelmed buyers, many investors were wiped out, and the system of credit contracted, choking the rest of the economy. 
   In the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration acted to prevent a repetition of the ruinous 1920s. Commercial banks were separated from investment banks, so that bankers could not prosper by underwriting bogus securities and foisting them on retail customers. Leverage was limited in order to rein in speculation with borrowed money. Investment banks, stock exchanges, and companies that publicly traded stocks were required to disclose more information to investors. Pyramid schemes and conflicts of interest were limited. The system worked very nicely until the 1970s--when financial innovators devised end-runs around the regulated system, and regulators stopped keeping up with them.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, President Bush finds himself increasingly isolated on the issue of Iraq. Public support continues to evaporate. This week in a devastating blow to the President's policy, Indiana Senator RICHARD LUGAR, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, a respected voice and, I might say, a very experienced voice on foreign policy for the past 30 years, publicly broke with the Bush administration on Iraq. 
   In remarks on the Senate floor which are prominently featured on the home page of his Web site, Senator Lugar said: ``Our course in Iraq has lost contact with our vital national security interests in the Middle East and beyond. Our continuing absorption with military activities in Iraq is limiting our diplomatic assertiveness there and elsewhere in the world. The prospects that the current ``surge'' strategy will succeed in the way originally envisioned by the President are very limited within the short period framed by our own domestic political debate. And the strident, polarized nature of that debate increases the risk that our involvement in Iraq will end in a poorly planned withdrawal that undercuts our vital interests in the Middle East. Unless we recalibrate our strategy in Iraq to fit our domestic political conditions and the broader needs of U.S. national security, we risk foreign policy failures that could greatly diminish our influence across that region and the world.'' 
   Senator Lugar framed the debate in terms of U.S. interests in the Middle East and the world. He is correct to note that: ``The current surge strategy is not an effective means of protecting those interests. Its prospects for success are too dependent on the actions of others who do not share our agenda. It relies on military power to achieve goals that it cannot achieve. It distances allies that we will need for any regional diplomatic effort. Its failure, without a careful transition to a backup policy, would intensify our loss of credibility. It uses tremendous amounts of resources that cannot be employed in other ways to secure our objectives. And it lacks domestic support that is necessary to sustain a policy of this type.'' 
   I would add several other observations: Rising casualties signal a strategy that is not working.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MISSISQUOI AND TROUT RIVERS WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and also rise in support of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers measure related to including Vermont's Missisquoi and Trout Rivers for further assessment. 
   Let me also say I think it's really sad that our GOP colleagues here are trying to divert attention from this bill and trying to change the subject to something that they have a pretty dismal record on.     
   In fact, since the Bush administration took office, our country is now importing over 1 billion more barrels of oil a year, the price of gasoline has doubled, as every American knows, and oil company profits are through the roof. Exxon alone, Exxon alone last year, made $40.6 billion in profits, one company; BP, $20 billion; Shell, $31 billion in profits; Conoco, $15.5 billion; Chevron, $17.1 billion. That is a total, just of those companies, of $125.3 billion. 
   They are loving every minute of this, friends. And the question for America is, do we want our people to be dependent on a diminishing global resource that becomes more precious every day, where blood for oil is now shed around the world? That is the real question. Are we going to grow up and live in the 21st century? It is a real choice.  
   One of the fellows over there on the other side of the aisle said, well, we got enough votes in the House. We sure do. We passed a couple of bills and sent them over to the Senate, where they sit unpassed. For example, our bills for extension of our renewable energy credits for solar and for wind, they are sitting over in the Senate. Do you know why? There isn't a majority of Democratic votes over there. The Senate is divided. It is 49D-49R. Our Senators are sitting on their hands over there, half of them. I would say to the gentleman who says we have got enough votes here, go get your friends over there to put their blood on the line over on the other side for the American people. They are wasting an awful lot of time. 
   I want to say too that the President has to sign these bills. Look what he did to the agriculture bill, one of the most important bills we have brought to this floor to try to create a new biofuels industry for this country, which rural America wanted and wants and is leading into an energy independent future for this country. What did the President of the United States do? He vetoed it. We had to override the veto here and in the other body. That is the kind of mess we have got here in Washington. 
   Boy, do we ever need a working majority in the Senate. And we need a bigger working majority here in the House to do what the American people sent us here to do, and that is to help our children have a better future, to have an independent energy future for this country, and not to try to say that ``business as usual'' is the course of the hour. Oh, no. Our people expect us to play the piano on all keys. 
   Where have you been for the last 8 years and where has the President of the United States been for the last 8 years? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank you very much for yielding. 
   Let me just say that I represent one of the solar centers of this country, one of the three top places that are inventing the future for our people. We need the help of the President of the United States. We don't need him to hold up renewable energy credits in this body or over in the Senate. Our people have seen the future, and they are building it. We don't need to have this administration produce an energy plan back in their first year that didn't even include agriculture, not even a mention of it, and renewables, and then defunded renewables for most of the years that they sat over there on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   We do need new leadership. We need a working majority in the Senate. And we need a greater working majority here and a President who will stand at the side of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to express deep appreciation to Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus and certainly to Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and Carolyn Maloney of New York, who really fashioned a bill that deals with the prolonged housing market slump, due in large measure to increasing rates of foreclosure. 
   The State of Ohio welcomes this measure. We have been particularly hard hit. The credit gap in Ohio is estimated between $14 and $21 billion, as over 200,000 more mortgages will reset at higher rates over the next 2 years. We don't need any more vacant units depressing the housing market in our region. 
   Government-sponsored entities can and should play a major role in reversing this trend. This bill does that. I would oppose any amendments designed to weaken or eliminate the much-needed National Housing Trust Fund. Homeownership is the most important savings account that any American family accumulates. 
   In passing this legislation, we assure that this Congress understands that as well as the necessity of keeping our housing market strong as fundamental to bolstering the economy of our entire country and helping it grow. 
   Chairman Frank, I deeply thank you on behalf of the Governor of Ohio and all the people of Ohio who are looking to us for leadership to help them hold on to their most important asset, their home.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (A SKEPTICAL VIEW OF THE WALL STREET BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman, the chairman of a subcommittee on International Relations, who has just dedicated himself, his great intelligence and great fervor, to helping to explain to the American people and our colleagues what is really at stake, and to try to move this institution, the House of Representatives, the closest body left at the Federal level to the American people, to move us to the right decision tomorrow. 
   Tonight, so many of us, we are praying for our American republic, and we ask the American people to pray with us and to pray for this House, and to pray without fear. Franklin Roosevelt said, ``All we have to fear is fear itself.'' We need to make wise decisions; not decisions made in haste or in panic. 
   If we vote ``no'' tomorrow, that is not a vote for no action. A ``no'' vote tomorrow will signal we want a better answer, and we will work here until we get it. 
   The other night the Senate voted to pass their version of a bill, and the stock market went down. Explain that to me. They passed the bill. It goes down.     
   I don't think there is any relationship between day-to-day trades, what is happening in the markets and what is happening here. We know that there is a serious issue in our financial system because credit markets are seized up. As others have said, what we can do there is to ask the FDIC to employ its emergency powers, which are already law, and agree to cover all creditors, bondholders and depositors in those institutions and that that will take the fear out of that system because they're scared, too, because they don't know, if they borrow from bank X in another city, whether that bank will be around the next day. Those banks are liquid. In other words, they have money to lend, but they're afraid, too. So we've got to get the fear out of the system. Let us pray to not have fear. 
   If we pass the bill the administration has sent us, one of the things that's going to happen, plus what they did over in the Senate, is that we're going to add 870 more billion dollars to our debt. We can't afford to do that right now. That is a very bad decision because we are in debt. We will be over $12 trillion in debt. The value of our dollar is already going down. This will push it down more, and our deficit is going up, which is not such a good position to be in. So we need a solution that doesn't raise our deficit by any more. 
   By declaring that emergency at the FDIC, it gives the FDIC and its bank examiners enormous powers to go around and to try to make the loans that are necessary, to work out real estate loans where those need to be worked out. They can even get into executive compensation, and they can look for fraudulent accounting throughout the country. That's what bank examiners do, and they're really good at it. Ask any banker. We need to enliven that system and make it function. 
   Then we need to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has moved along this week and has been doing better than it has in the past, to help these banks within their accounting systems give a true value to the real estate assets on their books and not to some artificial index that bears no relation to reality, to what has happened in Cleveland or in Toledo or anywhere else, and to use the private sector as we did back in the 1980s--to heal the system and to use its power and to do it with discipline and rigor, not to take $870 billion and reward those who have had very bad behavior on Wall Street. 
   I'm sure my dear colleague from California and Congressman Kucinich from Ohio, who has been such a stalwart in fighting for the people of Cleveland and of our country, would agree that the bill they're sending over from the Senate has had no hearings in this House. When we sent our bill over there, it was about that thick. The bill that came back to us today is about that thick. It was so heavy I couldn't even carry it over here to the floor. We have had not hearing one on that bill here in this Chamber. We are not following regular order, and that is not in the interest of the American people. At a minimum, there ought to be regular order with the committees of jurisdiction. 
   They've stuffed tax issues in that bill over on the Senate side. I understand there are Exxon Valdez provisions. There is even something for wooden arrows for children. There are trade provisions in there, and there is even Puerto Rican rum. How about that one? They've put the Alternative Minimum Tax in there, which sounds great except they didn't have any offsets, so it increases the deficit even more. 
   We haven't had hearings, so we'll have to do a better job of due diligence here. Really, our leadership should allow us to do that. One day or two days or five days isn't going to make that much difference in what is happening in the markets. 
   Let me give a point of view here as to one of the things that, I think, is happening in all of this. Why is the Treasury moving this in this way so fast now? 
   I think it has to do with the fact that so much of our debt has been financed by foreigners and by foreign banks that  the Treasury is a little bit worried about that as we begin a new fiscal year and that rather than presenting a balanced budget or a budget that moves us to a balance over the next few years that they're giving us more debt on top of old debt, which is a backwards way to help this economy. 
   This past week, it was announced in Reuters news service that seven banks in China had lost over $700 million because of what happened at Lehman Brothers with its implosion and that the National Bank of China was paying attention to that and that the debt dealings that they were having with the United States, particularly at the beginning of the new fiscal year, which is October 1, had created a bit of tension in that system and that it is actually our deficit and our difficulty in financing that--because we have a President who conducted two wars without paying for them--that our credit situation is not as good as it should be. 
   There are instruments, we've been told, such as credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that have to be covered. Well, let's be honest with one another. If that's what we're going to be doing, then let's tell the American people, and let's get it done the right way. We understand, in this $870 billion that they want to take from the taxpayers, that over half of that money will go to foreign creditors. Doesn't this Congress and don't the American people have a right to know to whom and how much and what this all means and how we got into this situation? Because, if we really don't understand what we're getting into, we can't get out of it. If only a few people know--and this is an inside trade, inside of Washington--and the American people don't understand it and we don't do this together as a people, then how are we really going to make it better unless we all walk together and get through this together? 
   I have a great deal of confidence in our banking system, and I would encourage and would hope that Secretary Paulson and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke, and the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chairman Bair, and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox, eat lunch tomorrow. I hope you figure out how to advise the President of the United States because I really do think those emergency powers at the FDIC would give great confidence to the system. When you do that, you will get an inflow of foreign funds into this country rather than the kind of policy you're following now, which is making those credit markets tighter and tighter and tighter in a banking system that is fundamentally sound and liquid. 
   So pay attention to the booking of those assets through the Securities and Exchange Commission. Help our banks weather this period. Give them some confidence, and help us to heal this in the full sunlight, not in a quick vote that is rushed through here tomorrow. 
   I want to thank my dear colleague from California, Brad Sherman, who has been a true, true leader in this effort to try to do this the right way, not the fast way. I thank the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as the House approaches a vote on the Senate's Wall Street bailout bill, I urge caution to my colleagues. We need regular order, not panic. We want the right deal, not a fast deal. There is a better way to address the credit crunch facing our banks than taxpayers printing money for Wall Street's bad actions. We must use the FDIC as we did in the 1980s to resolve thousands of problem institutions. In those days, we had over $100 billion worth of resolutions that cost but $1.8 billion to the insurance fund, not the taxpayer. 
   We need to have the Securities and Exchange Commission work with our banks on how they account for the real estate on their books not with arbitrary indexes and measures, but rather to true value. That would unlock billions of dollars, $500 billion in the system today, and would ease interbank lending. 
   Let's use the right medicine, not a Band-aid through which a hemorrhage will soon break as our deficit explodes even more and the value of the dollar declines further. Let's have the wisdom and courage to do what's right.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (``NO'' ON THE BUSH-PAULSON BAILOUT PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, for the second time in one week, this House is confronted with a momentous vote on the economic emergency facing our Nation, and it is imperative that we get it right. We must do the right thing. We must vote ``no'' on the Bush-Paulson bailout package. Three days have passed since we rejected that inadequate proposal, but one thing hasn't changed: This is still a bailout for Wall Street. One thing has changed: The cost has increased dramatically. Believe me, if you didn't like the first version of the Bush-Paulson bailout, you're going to hate this one because it's even worse, 22 percent worse. 
   On Monday, the bailout bill would have cost the American taxpayer $700 billion. Three days later, the bill coming from the Senate is going to cost us $850 billion, driving up our deficit, driving up our borrowing. The Senate drove up the cost of the bailout by 22 percent by adding tax giveaways for special interest groups. America might be facing an economic emergency, but it's Christmas in October in the Senate here in Washington. The Bush-Paulson bailout bill is loaded up like a Christmas tree with ornaments known as tax giveaways for special interests. These  ornaments will make a lot of people rich, but your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren will have to pay for them for years. 
   When this body, having been rushed to judgment by the President and by our own leadership, rejected the plan on Monday, it was alleged that the House vote was responsible for the Dow Jones Industrial Average's falling by 700 points. So how do we explain the fact that the stock market fell almost 350 points today, the day after the Senate passed the Bush-Paulson bailout bill? 
   What the stock market said today was heads you lose; tails you lose. America will still have a housing crisis even if the House puts the American taxpayer on the hook for another $870 billion for Wall Street. So don't believe people who tell you that the market is responding negatively to votes against the Bush-Paulson plan. The stock market is reacting negatively to the lack of leadership. The market knows that the Bush-Paulson plan is the wrong medicine. It knows the Bush-Paulson plan will not solve the problems in our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people have already spoken, and the financial markets are speaking, too. The Bush-Paulson plan, even this porked-up version, is not the solution of the economic emergency facing our country, and that is why the House should not rush to judgment. 
   This House should stop and take a deep breath and make a commitment to stay in session until we enact comprehensive reform of the financial system and not take a quick vote on a stopgap plan that will cost the taxpayers $870 billion and counting. As I have said all along, we have to have reform first, not last after they take the money. 
   I know there's a political sideshow underway, and I realize that certain Members face tough reelection battles and that they desperately want to wrap up business here so that they can go back home to campaign. To them, I would say, ``Trust your constituents. They will respect you for staying in Washington to address the economic emergency rather than your running home to shake hands and to kiss babies.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the Senate's response to the House rejection of the Paulson plan was to add more spending. So we got tax breaks for rum. You've got it right. R-U-M. We got tax breaks for mine rescue teams, tax breaks for railroads, tax breaks for automobile race tracks, and tax breaks for wool research. I'm not making this up. They added tax breaks for movie and television productions, 6 pages of earmarks for Alaska for litigation in the Exxon Valdez disaster and, the coup de grace, tax breaks for wooden arrows designed for use by children. 
   Now, our Nation is facing an economic emergency, and the Senate adds a tax break for wooden arrows designed for use by children. One would ask: Children's wooden arrows? Why not the bows, too? 
   This is surreal. The American people deserve better. It appears that the Bush-Paulson team has failed to sell the country on the merits of a Wall Street bailout, and has decided to buy the package. We saw the same thing here in 1993 when the Clinton administration couldn't sell NAFTA on its merits and, instead, opened the Federal Treasury to buy the votes of enough Members to win passage. 
   Let's get back to reality, but first of all, everybody needs to calm down. Don't give in to fear and don't give in to panic. We need regular order in this House. We need to be the deliberative body that our system of government envisions and demands. 
   First of all, this downturn is not--I repeat ``not''--as serious as ever faced by our Nation. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the conditions were much worse: 3,000 banks failed. Interest rates shot up to 21 percent. Hundreds of agricultural banks failed. In using the powers of the FDIC and their emergency authorities, we worked it out without 1 cent being charged to the taxpayer. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the time this evening. We face a real financial crisis, and we ought to stay here until we resolve it the right way, not the fast way.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (OIL EXPORTS FROM COLOMBIA -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the papers back home tell the story: 25 firefighter jobs advertised, thousands of applicants. Bass Pro Sporting Goods building a new store, 300 jobs, 13,000 applicants, and the applications keep coming in. Yet the Bush administration last week sent Congress another job-killing NAFTA-like trade pact, this time for the South American nation of Colombia. 
   But why Colombia? And why now? The answer to both questions, in a word, is oil. Rather than paying attention to what is happening in this country, again, the Bush administration is focused to a new set of global oil deposits. 
   Why Colombia? In the big picture of global trade, Colombia is relatively insignificant to the United States. So why would the Bush administration make it a top priority in the final year of his presidency? Because oil represents more than half of Colombia's exports to the United States. And nothing drives Bush administration policy more than oil. 
   Ten years ago, Colombia wasn't even exporting oil. It was an oil-importing country. But with the Middle East in turmoil, the Bush administration, like the Clinton administration before it, is doing everything it can to make Colombia safe for oil exports to us. At a time when U.S. relations with Venezuela, South America's leading oil producer, have dropped to an all-time low, Colombia has emerged as the continent's fourth leading supplying supplier. 
   A decade ago, as I mentioned, Colombia was an oil-importing nation. Now, multinational oil companies have made huge investments because of tax favorability in the area of a giant, crescent-shaped, underocean oil field that stretches from Colombia to Peru. This trade agreement is not about cocoa. It is not about coal. It is not about cut flowers. This is an agreement about oil. 
   Buying oil from Colombia piles more oil trade deficit on top of the $800 billion overall trade deficit our Nation has wracked up with nations all over the world. We continue to export jobs at an accelerating rate and import more and more and more from abroad with oil leading the way by far the number one category in the red. 
   As in Middle East, the United States government is pouring billions of dollars into Colombia in the form of military and foreign aid in order to protect the oil companies' investments. 
   Why now? Because the United States is being forced by political realities to relocate its sole defense base in Latin America out of Ecuador, whose president wants it removed from there. And by contrast, the Uribe government in Colombia has welcomed U.S. military involvement, seeing an opportunity to court favor with the Bush administration and the military protection that aid provides for oil exports. Only Israel and Egypt receive more military assistance from the United States. 
   According to Amnesty International, which opposes military aid to Colombia until human rights concerns are addressed, the U.S. contributes approximately $750 million, a quarter of $1 billion, each year. It is estimated that our country has sent Colombia more than $5 billion under the guise of Plan Colombia, with most of the assistance going to the military and police. 
   These parallels with the Middle East are troubling. In both regions, the United States risks its reputation with the ``people on the street'' by mixing economic designs on resources not belonging to us, and then moving defense assets to protect that interest. 
   Yes, average Americans are justifiably upset over rising prices at the pump. A gallon of gasoline now costs as much or more than a gallon of milk. Think about that. But surely the answer to this predicament is not to increase our oil dependence on Colombia. If our citizens saw how our America has dedicated its military assets to back up that oil flow owned by private interests, they would be really enraged. In Latin America, the United States is viewed as anything but the ``Sweet Land of Liberty.'' 
   As in the Middle East, public opinion throughout Latin America has turned strongly negative toward the United States. People to our south view the Bush administration's policies as concerned only with the wealthiest segments of society or their American investment partners and essentially apathetic about democracy for the average person. To achieve the real Alliance For Progress envisioned by John F. Kennedy, our policies should promote democracy and cooperation, not resource exploitation. 
   Why would our government tether itself to a regime that has tolerated the murder of thousands of labor leaders, more than the rest of the countries of the world combined? Already this year, 17 more labor leaders have been assassinated in Colombia. The Bush administration's failure to cure America's oil addiction is no reason to overlook the crimes of impunity that are being committed regularly against organized labor in Colombia. 
   Once again, however, our foreign policy is being held hostage to the demands of an oil-based economy. Haven't we moved beyond the 20th century? The issue is not the U.S. trade relationship with Colombia, but the failure of the Bush administration to make our economy more stable at home by pursuing the important goal of energy independence. 
   Our national leaders should wake up and move us to freedom from imported petroleum. This is a national imperative as serious as our Nation has ever faced. We don't need Colombian oil now. We need energy independence here at home.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 20, FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Continuing Resolution for Fiscal 2007 and I join in complimenting our distinguished chairman, Mr. Obey, for accomplishing in a few weeks, with the distinguished Senate Appropriations Chairman, ROBERT BYRD, what their predecessors were both unwilling and unable to do. 
   A mess was inherited from the prior Congress, and this bill cleans those up and corrects them in a very responsible fashion. 
   If any of our colleagues on the other side want to criticize this package, I ask why didn't they fix it when they had a chance? I also ask why did they create this irresponsible problem by delaying passage of these necessary measures in the first place? It should have been done by the end of September of last year. Despite the constitutional expectations to pass all appropriation bills by September 30 in time for the new fiscal year, the last time all appropriation bills passed on time was 1994, when the Democrats were in charge, and thank goodness we are again. 
   The action today roughly provides cuts in over 60 programs and rescinds unobligated balances in order to transfer $10 billion in savings that are used to address critical investments such as our veterans' health care and health accounts of the Department of Defense to care for our returning wounded veterans. It will keep our Social Security offices open rather than shutting them down. Community policing is increased by $70 million. And it provides important help for students, Pell grants, about $260 more per year for each of them. It covers additional children with disabilities. It provides $103.7 million for Head Start. It provides funding to expand some of our community health centers to take care of people who don't have any health insurance. It keeps our Public Housing authorities utility costs at least paid for the moment. It provides $125 million for 38,000 additional students below grade level. And we provide an additional $197.1 million for the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund. Federal Highway funds are provided at levels guaranted in SAFETEA and Amtrak funding is maintained at 2006 levels. We know that is still $266 million below 2004 levels. We just don't have the funds to do everything we want to do. But at least we want to move forward. 
   Our Nation has many needs, Mr. Speaker, and we need to understand and meet those responsibilities for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. But surely we have responsibilities here at home, and we have a responsibility to meet the need for a defensible budget policy that imposes tough decisions in tough time. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. Obey as our new chairman of the Appropriations Committee, somebody who is not only well suited to this position, but probably the finest chairman of Appropriations I have ever had the opportunity to serve with. 
   Thank you for doing what you had to do for the Nation. Congratulations. 
   Please, I ask all my colleagues to vote for this continuing resolution on behalf of all the citizens of our country.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICAN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Wall Street's big banking boys, those self-proclaimed geniuses of high finance, are bankrupting America. These plunderers of our economy who have fought tooth and nail against financial regulation now are running home to mama. They who virulently oppose government oversight in the markets have come begging to the U.S. Government, mama, to bail them out of their bad decisions. They want mama to make it all better. 
   Well, mama, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, now run by Wall Street's best friends, have happily been shelling out from our taxpayers more than $300 billion already and counting for those irresponsible Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, homeowners in my district are suffering as a result of these high flying bankers' self-aggrandizing decisions. 
   I've not seen Secretary Paulson or Chairman Bernanke running around Ohio over the weekend, expressing concern about working people's houses and about helping them work out troubled loans. No. All they're doing is sending those folks the bills. 
   The first check that mama wrote was in March. The Fed's main role in the Bear Stearns buyout by JPMorgan Chase was a $29 billion loan to a corporation it created to buy $30 billion worth of assets from Bear Stearns. If the assets gained value, the Fed would profit. If the assets lost value, the first $1 billion would be lost by JPMorgan Chase, but the rest of the losses would be borne by--guess who?--the American taxpayer. 
   Then mama wrote a blank check, a big one, to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now, that bill is already $200 billion, and it could rise to $2.4 trillion, a blank check. Last year, the head of Freddie Mac earned compensation of $18.3 million, and Fannie Mae's chief, David Schmidt, received $11.6 million directly, not counting all of their other bonuses and stock options and who knows what else. 
   Now mama has written a third check for the crisis on Wall Street, and has effectively nationalized American International Group today with an $85 billion loan.     
   I wonder why we don't just change the name of the U.S. Treasury to the Sovereign Wealth Fund, because we are borrowing money from other countries in order to bail out these institutions. 
   By the way, from 1999 to 2004, the CEO of AIG, Maurice ``Hank'' Greenberg, was named to Forbes Magazine as among the ``world's richest people,'' with a net worth in 2004 of $3.6 billion. What a cozy group they have up there on Wall Street. 
   The CEO named earlier this year, Robin Willumstad, had been the president of Citigroup since 2002, and his base salary was $1 million, plus up to $4 million to $8 million in targeted annual bonuses, plus $13 million targeted annual incentive pay and a one-time $24.5 million restricted stock award to vest over 4 years. 
   Were our homeowners to get a deal like that. The American people are truly getting bilked. They didn't get a fair share of the upside, and they are getting all of the downside and a huge IOU. Foreclosures are going up in Ohio. And while Wall Street is made whole, the folks back on Main Street are losing their homes and getting the bill. 
   So while the banks get to run home to Mama and they are crying, we really have to ask ourselves, what has Mama given us here? What does it say about our values when we pump hundreds of billions of dollars into preserving Wall Street's bad boys while ignoring the plight of the American people? 
   Across Main Streets, from coast to coast, people are losing their homes. But are Mr. Paulson or Mr. Bernanke giving them any bet on the upside? They are not even helping them on the downside. All they are giving them is a bill for Wall Street's excesses. When Roosevelt talked about malefactors of wealth, boy, was he right. 
   I feel sorry for our country, I feel sorry for this Congress, that we can't do a better job of standing up for the people today who are losing their homes in Ohio. Thirty-eight thousand more perched at the edge. Our State needs $20 billion just to do workouts in our State. Where is the Federal Reserve? Where is the Treasury Department? Why do they only help the rich people? What about the rest of the people who have to work for a living? 
   I can't think when I have been as upset as I am tonight about what is happening by the big shots, and the people who are paying the bill are getting shoved off the edge. 
   Wake up, America. Wake up, America. Pay attention to what is happening here. Contact your Member of Congress. Every citizen of this country that is a taxpayer and every citizen who owns that home mortgage has a right to a decent life, not just the big shots up at the end of Wall Street up in New York City.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (ANNOUNCING THE PASSING OF THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I seek to be recognized in order to officially for the first time on the Record place the passing from this life of our beloved colleague, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio's 11th District. 
   I would like to announce to my colleagues that after votes this evening, we will manage a special bereavement resolution. Many Members, I know, will want to pay tribute to Stephanie's beautiful life. We as Ohioans, as Buckeyes, share her son Mervyn's profound sense of loss; but also I know we share an equal gratitude for the manner in which she lived her life and what she contributed, not just to her family or her church family or her staff, but to our country and indeed to our world. 
   When Stephanie hugged many of us before we left in August, I can tell you I certainly didn't think I would be down here this evening. Any Member who wishes to honor her life can do so after the votes are cast this evening. 
   Let me just mention to my colleagues that we knew Stephanie here as Chair of the Ethics Committee and as the first African American woman to serve on the Ways and Means Committee. But her path was not an easy one. Coming from East Cleveland, she was a gregarious leader who blazed many trails.     
   She was one of the few women who have ever served in the Ohio delegation, and the first African American woman ever to be elected to the Congress of the United States from the State of Ohio. She was the first black woman to become a judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, as well as the county's first African American prosecutor. 
   She gave so much to so many. I always seemed to catch Stephanie running through the airport with her suitcase, traveling somewhere, with that boundless energy and that constant smile; and we will pay tribute more fully to her later this evening. 
   To her son, Mervyn, who I would expect is listening this evening, we all know that your mother's strength will hold you now in a very profound way; and we extend our deepest sympathy to you. We know that in the years ahead you will come to appreciate even more what her life has meant to our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think my dear colleague, Mr. Boehner, the minority leader, has remarks at this time. 
   I will be happy to yield you time.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman. 
   And as I paid my respects at the wake the day before the service, I was reminded I had been in that church twice before to pay tribute to Stephanie's father who died during her tenure here, and then her husband who also died. And it was almost hard to walk into that church for the third time, and my respect for her grew even more for the strength that she showed to all of us despite these enormous personal losses that she had borne. 
   Mr. Speaker, in concluding, let me just say that from 1 Peter 4:10-11, this is what the prayer card said at her funeral service:  
   Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.  
   And at the base of the card is Stephanie's signature with the words, ``I hope I made you proud.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, may I ask now for the membership to rise and pay tribute to the life of Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek). And your mother certainly had a man child too. And we love Carrie Meek, Congresswoman Meek. I miss her very much, and she must be very, very proud of you. I am certain of that. 
   We have shared so many memories this evening, and there are very serious ones that I will end with. But I have to say that I can still see Stephanie sitting in the Speaker's chair in the reddest of red suits, and she just beamed. And she loved that chair, and she loved that gavel, and she used it. You could hear it ring against the walls when she would hit that gavel down. 
   And I did not know that she was not the only member of a sisterhood that wore those red dresses. It wasn't until her service in Cleveland that I saw an entire street from side to side covered with women in red dresses. Stephanie had many acquaintances and many friends. And I know that those red outfits gave her strength, and it certainly brightened this Chamber. 
   I remember her scarves with the fringes. I don't know where Stephanie got all those, but they certainly added a flourish here, and they helped to cheer us up and to add to the full smile, ear to ear, that greeted every person that she ever met. 
   Now, some of us knew about her cheers. There were many cheers, sports cheers, political cheers, Democratic cheers. She had a chant and a rhyme and a rhythm about her, and she had a presence, and she took those cheers forward. I know one of those cheers, one of the more recent ones with a rhyme was H-I-L-L-A-R-Y. I know that that was one of the latest cheers. 
   She had a great devotion to youth, to the younger women who are serving in this Chamber, three of whom we just heard from, Congresswoman Richardson, Congresswoman Edwards, and Congresswoman Clarke. And it almost seems somewhat providential that as we lost three women from the Congressional Black Caucus, we have three younger women on the floor tonight. That says something right there. And I have no doubt Stephanie is watching over making sure that the numbers even get better. 
   I think that her path breaking efforts in so many ways put her in the footsteps of Sojourner Truth; particularly, I am woman, I can do anything. I am woman, I can do anything. I know Stephanie believed that to her very core. Her zest for life and her indomitable spirit surround us, surround her son, surround her sister, surround all of her friends, her church friends in Ohio, all of those who came to know her, appreciate her. 
   And I know that Congressman Louis Stokes, her predecessor, feels this loss particularly deeply. And I recall with great affection his service here. And as the years go on, it is amazing the events that we witness and that we endure. 
   And in Stephanie's memory, I want to thank Congressman Meek for holding this special hour on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and allowing me to add a few words to the eloquence that has been spoken this evening in memory of our beloved friend. And I yield back the time you have kindly given me.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it is with a profound sense of sadness, as well as a deep sense of privilege that I rise this evening to commemorate and to celebrate the life of our friend, colleague, and sister, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio's 11th District. This evening, we do this with the deepest gratitude for her life, and on behalf of our entire Ohio delegation, the people of our State, her home city of Cleveland, and citizens far and wide, who were blessed to know and walk, work, worship and smile along with Stephanie. 
   On the day of her funeral, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, or actually it was the day after, the Sunday Plain Dealer, had a very large photo of the memorial service held in Cleveland, Ohio. And the headline read, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, 1949 to 2008: Tears flow, laughter rolls during memorial service. And the paper goes on to recount so many beautiful, beautiful remarks and remembrances that people across this country attributed to her life. We will be placing this in the Congressional Record, as well as I would like to read from my home paper, the Toledo Blade, way on the other side of the State from where Stephanie represented. It stated, a leader passes, the loss of her fighting spirit will be keenly felt, deeply mourned and difficult to replace. 
   I think particularly this evening of her son, Mervyn. We wish him comfort, and we wish him her strength as he mourns her passing. 
   We all know that when one met Stephanie, you knew you had met strength. You knew you had met someone who endured struggle. She had a keen intelligence, a high-minded idealism, and wow, her charisma just overflowed. 
   The other day I was in my district and I met a man from Cleveland who had gone to school with Stephanie. And I said, tell me, was Stephanie always that enthusiastic? He said, ``Marcy, I went to law school with her. She never changed.'' 
   And from the time she was in her late teens and early 20s to her service here, she had the same boundless energy, drive and positive spirit. 
   She was a devoted wife, a beloved mother, a sister to us all, and an elected leader, in that order. And she relished all of her life's roles. Her drive and energy were genuine, and they were infectious. And she carved a nobler path for America with her election as the first African American woman from Ohio to serve in the U.S. Congress. We Ohioans were very proud of her. 
   I know that I, like my colleagues, have so many vivid lasting memories of Stephanie. Upon her first swearing in, I still recall a little table in a reception hall here where I was able to present her with a single red rose as she was sitting next to her predecessor, Congressman Louis Stokes, and how she poignantly responded. She knew the steepness of the climb. 
   I recall my efforts to comfort her on the loss of her husband, and she immediately reciprocated as she shared with me, over my Blackberry, a favorite poem from which she drew succor. 
   Imagine how many memories each of us has, how many thousands of lives she touched, representing a district and State that tested her talents, her spirit, and her conscience daily. She served people well beyond her district, logging thousands of miles in freedom's cause. 
   I don't think I saw Stephanie too many times without that little valise in the back room here. She was always going somewhere. She held a hard job, and she put her entire being into it. She literally gave herself to us. And in her memory, we should dedicate ourselves to her unfinished work. 
   One can imagine how few women have ever served in the Congress from our State. To those afforded the privilege, there is a priceless bond that links our spirits and provides support. 
   Stephanie was such a valued sister. Though her years with us were far too short, her impact endures well beyond the years. She made history. She spoke her conscience, and she reveled in every step of the journey. 
   Thanks be to God, she did not suffer in the end. The Lord spared her that, perhaps as, through her life, she had endured too much personal sadness and loss that would have broken lesser spirits. 
   In loss, Stephanie's strength strengthens us. Her enduring personal legacy of character and endurance, beyond her milestone achievements, remain the portrait of her life. Our delegation is especially honored to fittingly commemorate her life and achievements here this evening.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to place in the Record the names of the very able staff of Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. This staff has endured great sadness, and they have tried to carry on with their leader being in spiritual guidance but not there personally. 
   And I would like to thank, from her district office, Betty Pinkney, her district director; Beverly Charles, her senior liaison; Theresa Lang Coaxum, her health liaison; Sharon Cole, business liaison; Saulette Reed, her office manager. 
   And here in Washington, Kimberley Alton, her legislative director; Lalla King Green, her scheduler; Eric Hammond, her staff assistant; Aaron Wasserman, her legislative correspondent; Darrell Doss, her tax counsel; Athena Abdullah, her health counsel; Nicole Y. Williams, her communications director; and Patrice Willoughby, dear Patrice, her chief of staff and counsel, who has tried to stand in Stephanie's place during these very difficult days. 
   And, finally, from the Committee on Standards, Dawn Kelly Mobley, the counsel to the chairwoman. 
   These are wonderful, wonderful staff people who have Stephanie's heart, and we want to do everything we can to help them through this very difficult time. And we thank them for their service to Stephanie and serving the people of the 11th District and the people of our country. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, I would like to place in the Record before I call on our final speaker this story: There were many tributes paid to Stephanie at the service in Cleveland. One of the most moving speakers, the friends of Stephanie, heard Saturday from no politician or preacher but from a young 16 year old named Tiffany, a member of an all girls health careers class at Cleveland Martin Luther King Junior  High School that Stephanie took under her wing 2 years ago. Tiffany recalled Jones telling the girls ``This is the future. You are the future.'' And the Congresswoman took time from her political and legislative schedule to visit the class and take them places. She took them to church one Sunday, but Tiffany had to work that day. So Stephanie dropped by to the workplace with Tiffany's classmates in tow. Stephanie kept her eye on every one of them. ``We're family,'' Tiffany told her classmates, who stood in a show of unity with their peer. She said, ``We've got to stick together. We have got to carry on in her legacy. She was steward, protector, and advocate to us. I will miss her as a friend.'' 
   Stephanie had friends of all ages. We thank her for her leadership and for the seeds that she planted in the new growth forest that is growing in Cleveland and growing across this country to which she devoted her life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to call as our final speaker in this bereavement resolution Stephanie's very good friend from the State of Missouri, Congressman Emanuel Cleaver.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (GOLD, SILVER, COPPER AND THE PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wish to review a recent vote that was held here in this Congress regarding the so-called Peru Free Trade Agreement, and to encourage the American people to read the fine print and to pay attention to the connection between that Peru vote and the value of the U.S. dollar and some hidden forces that may have been responsible for bringing that vote on Peru to the forefront now. Because people in my district were saying, why vote on Peru now? Why vote on another NAFTA-like accord on trade when our balance of trade is so seriously out of whack? Let me mention for the Record, and I will place these articles in the Record this evening; Peru is the world's third largest producer of copper, zinc and tin. It is the biggest producer of silver, and is the fifth largest producer of gold. In fact, Peru has the largest gold mine in this hemisphere owned by an American company. 
   Many workers in the mines in Peru went on strike. Over 6,300 workers took their lives in their hands the Monday before the vote trying to send a message to the people of the United States and this Congress that they are treated unfairly, the wages they earn, conditions under which they work, their ability to share in profits, the ability to have decent pensions; all of those were very important issues. Their  voices were hardly heard. It does not mean that they were not speaking truth to power; it means that certain ears here in Washington may have been closed, but they still spoke to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the dollar continues its downward spiral. In fact, we know the value of our dollar has fallen by nearly a quarter against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. And while that dollar is falling, other commodities in the market are growing in value. And guess what those are. Metals. Metals are constituting a very large share of where people are moving assets because the dollar is losing its value. In fact, the U.S. Mint just directed that the American people aren't supposed to be melting down pennies for the copper content in them. 
   The Economist pointed out that in 2002 the euro was worth 86 cents; today, it buys $1.48. We know our credit markets are troubled. Credit Suisse predicted that gold would top $1,000 an ounce by 2012. There are big interests at stake in deals like this deal that was just passed in this House for Peru, and gold and silver and copper have a lot to do with it. 
   In an article entitled, ``Miner Player'' last month in the Economist, it reported, ``The net profits of mining companies rose from $4 billion in 2002 to $67 billion in 2006.'' They're doing very well, thank you, but they are not sharing in that extraordinary increase in wealth with their own citizens. In fact, the export of these precious metals accounts for over half of Peru's export earnings, over half from mines owned by companies in this country. Are you beginning to get the picture? 
   The overall profitability of these concerns, which was negative in 1998, is now four times the 7 percent average of growth for the top 500 companies, and the dominant U.S. import from Peru is? Gold, constituting 24 percent of their exports in 2006. 
   So, when the miners of Peru, who work under godforsaken, horrendous conditions, tried to get our attention, this Congress turned its back. You hardly heard anything in the debate, but they were standing tall in their villages all across Peru. In fact, what's happening to the peasants in Peru is they're being shoved off their land because there might be gold underneath it. And they're crying out to us. Will anyone, for heaven's sake, will anyone here in this country hear them? 
   The article that was published on Monday before the vote indicated that Peru's Labor Ministry ordered the miners to go back to work or they would lose their jobs. And we were told that, oh, don't worry about the vote on Peru because labor conditions in Peru are just terrific. Well, the article that came out from Bloomberg News Service on November 6 indicated that, in fact, the government had declared the mining strike illegal. 
   We weren't listening to them. It's really tragic that when an agreement comes before us like this, we do not listen to those who are the least among us and speak truth to power. 
   I place all these articles in the Record this evening. 
   Peru To Declare Mines Strike Illegal, Pinilla Says  
   Nov. 6 (Bloomberg).--Peru's government will declare a two-day national mining strike illegal today, forcing miners to return to work or lose their jobs, Labor Minister Susana Pinilla said. 
   The strike, which seeks to pressure companies to improve pensions, profit-sharing and rights for subcontracted workers, is ``politically motivated,'' Pinilla told Lima-based CPN Radio. 
   ``Union leaders have a different stance that has nothing to do with worker vindication,'' Pinilla said. ``They have led workers into an illegal strike where they could lose their jobs.'' 
   Strikes this year, including a five-day national walkout by Peruvian miners in May, have cut copper output in Peru, Chile and Mexico, helping to spur a 17 percent rally in the price of the metal. Peru is the world's third-largest producer of copper, zinc and tin, the biggest of silver and fifth-largest of gold. 
   The stoppage in Peru has affected mines owned by companies including Southern Copper Corp., Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Doe Run Resources Corp. 
   Workers also are on strike at mines run by Cia. De Minas Buenaventura SA, tin miner Minsur SA, Shougang Hierroperu's iron mine and zinc producers Cia. Minera Raura SA and Cia. Minera Santa Luisa, according to Mining Federation spokesman Cirilo Yarihuaman.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding and rise to oppose the amendment and in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   Today, this House moves America's working women into the 21st century. And, in so doing, I believe it is important to place on the record the story of our mother, Anastasia, who when she began work back in the middle of the last century as a counter waitress as Liberty Lunch on Broadway in Toledo, Ohio did not even earn the minimum wage. That was made possible only by the Fair Labor Standards Act passed in 1938. But even when that Act passed, her boss would then cash her check and deduct the increase from her, and pocket it himself. 
   I am privileged that I now, as a Congresswoman, came from a family that did not spare its children the story of hardship and struggle that still characterizes the lives of millions of women in our country today. In passing this act, I do so in memory of our mother and millions and millions of American women who ask only to be treated fairly in the workplace and earn equal pay for equal work and get that check. 
   It is a commentary on the struggle of working people everywhere that it takes a Nation centuries to enact into law what is decent and right on the merits. Today we do what is morally right and economically just. Today we give America's working women a real dose of liberty. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for yielding me time today, oppose this amendment but strongly support this measure.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, for generations Hershey's chocolate has been an American symbol. Soldiers abroad distributed it to smiling children. Across our country people everywhere recognize the distinctive shape of Hershey kisses. Now Hershey's, too, is being outsourced to Mexico, as the great sucking sound of outsourced jobs accelerate in our country. 
   Yesterday, the Hershey Company announced it was moving 1,500 more manufacturing jobs to Mexico, terminating 1,500 U.S. workers and all the dairy farmers that supply work and product into that company. 
   Hershey now joins the ranks of Hoover, Stanley, Champion, Ford, Chrysler, Huffy, Zebco, Levi's and Maytag, who have shipped thousands more U.S. jobs to countries where workers toil for starvation wages. 
   Now President Bush wants to renew more of the same fast-track trade authority, to ship more of these jobs to Mexico and other trade rivals. He wants to sell our economy to the highest bidders in foreign countries. 
   NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR and its cousin agreements have broken the middle class. Congress is long overdue to stand up for them. We must take back the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and start creating good jobs in our country again. It is time to stop fast track.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE REAL CULPRIT FOR RISING FOOD PRICES -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the world is beginning to understand what my constituents have known for far too long, higher food prices and higher  commodity prices are destroying prosperity for millions and millions of people here at home and abroad. Whether there is a hungry person in Toledo, Ohio or in Haiti, the rising costs of basic food are really placing the world's marginalized and poor in even a tighter squeeze. 
   Getting in the front of devastation that higher commodity prices can cause is a challenge to all of us. While I am pleased that the leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have called for half a billion dollars more to feed the poor of the world, I'm deeply troubled that these leaders have pointed to the same tired rhetoric in diagnosing the cause of these rising prices. It's been very interesting for me to hear them say they're blaming higher food prices on the production of ethanol and biodiesel in agricultural America, which is actually a new value-added market for our farmers. It's actually a new market that's taking land that is just laying fallow for years, where we have paid commodity payments and gotten nothing, now we are beginning to reuse some of that land again. 
   The real culprit for rising food prices is rising oil prices. Our world is facing a crisis precipitated by the greater competition for dwindling supplies of world energy that has caused all the prices of basic goods to skyrocket. But instead of dealing with that reality of how oil is embedded in every aspect of life in this country and globally, they're trying to blame this on the new developing market of renewable energy. 
   Yes, under current technology biofuels consume some food stocks for the production of fuel. Corn has been utilized by some ethanol producers, for example. But to claim that biofuels are the cause of rising food prices, that's disingenuous at best. Look to the rising oil prices at over $113 a barrel, and this oil-dependent economy must become energy independent here at home again. And renewable fuels based in agriculture are a part of the solution for this country in the world. 
   Take a look at the rising cost of fertilizer that can be directly attributed to the increasing cost of natural gas and smaller crop sizes. According to the recent Texas A&M Agriculture and Food Policy Center analysis, rising fertilizer costs have led to a $3 million acre reduction in planted corn in the 2006, 2007 crop year. 
   Let's look at another major cause globally of why food prices are going up: Drought. World food production has gone down because in Australia and eastern Europe, and because of poor weather in Canada and western Europe and Ukraine, we've seen overall production reduced. With such world stocks for wheat at 30-year lows, buyers are turning to the United States for supplies. Has the IMF offered suggestions to these nations for dealing with the drought that global warming is causing? No. They're just blaming America's farmers. 
   Higher incomes around the world are boosting demand for processed foods in countries such as India and China. And this higher demand has skyrocketed the need for products produced across the supply chain. Now, has the IMF sought to better manage the uncontrolled growth in developing countries? No. They're just blaming America's farmers.     
   With the U.S. dollar in free fall, American agricultural goods have become extremely attractive internationally and have placed great demand on foodstuff production domestically. With greater competition for food, with more U.S. exports, our weak dollar due to terrible economic policies here at home has decreased the power of Americans to purchase food produced right here in our country. Has the IMF identified the weak dollar as the challenge to millions of Americans faced with food shortages? Of course not. They just blame the U.S. farmer and the new developing market of biofuels. 
   With the price of oil reaching over $110 a barrel, the world's addiction to oil is driving up the production costs of agricultural products. How much do you think it costs to haul a truckload of bell peppers from Salinas Valley in California to Cleveland, Ohio? 
   I cannot accept IMF's wanton attack on the investment in rural America. If we follow their formula, we would not be growing any food domestically. If we were following IMF's advice, we would not be developing the infrastructure and capacity to produce our own renewable energy here at home and help lead the world in a real energy-independent transformation of this country. 
   Madam Speaker, Americans simply must commit to cutting off our oil addiction and restoring energy independence here at home.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (HEALTH CARE FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WAR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I think it's important for the President of the United States to pay attention to the over 100,000 Iraqi and Afghani veterans that are coming back to our country, U.S. citizens who have been wounded. 100,000. 
   This House passed a bill that increases spending in the Department of Veterans Affairs by 18 percent, the largest increase in American history, which is deserved because we have injured soldiers coming back to us who are not being treated. That bill is log jammed in the Senate. I invite the President of the United States to call over to the leadership in the Senate to say he's going to sign that bill and to move that bill this week. 
   Yesterday, I was out welcoming in an official ceremony the 983rd Combat Engineer Unit Heavy from the State of Ohio. It's a Reserve unit, over 1,000 soldiers who have been deployed to the theater in Iraq who came home, and this was the official welcome home ceremony to present them their warrior citizen flags and medals. It was a moving ceremony honoring their valor and their service to our country. 
   I had the opportunity at that ceremony to talk to Mrs. Tiffany Eckhart, the widow of Andy Eckhart, who lost his life in Iraq. And he was on his second deployment to Iraq. 
   She said several things to me. She said, Marcy, my husband never should have been deployed a second time because he had been injured in his first deployment. He had had a head injury, and she said, I want you to go back to Washington this week and tell the Congress and tell the Secretary of Defense and tell the President of the United States that every soldier who has been in combat in Iraq or in Afghanistan if they have had a head injury, before they are sent back again, they should be examined to make sure that there's nothing wrong, that there isn't a problem that affects their vision or in some way affects their functioning, which she claims is the reason for his death. 
   Now, if we are rotating people through so quickly and we aren't paying attention to the soldiers who are in  theatre, particularly the Guard and Reserve, which never get the attention that they should, shame on us. Shame on us. 
   The impact of these head injuries on our soldiers is serious, and with the explosions that are occurring, we are losing 80 percent of those who have lost their lives, 80 percent of our soldiers have died from IEDs, which are explosive devices, or from sniper shots to the back of the head, 80 percent. So the individual soldier is receiving these wounds largely in the head area, or if they have heard the explosive devices going off, they have had damage sometimes inside the head that you can't see. You can't see. So the Department of Defense should have a policy not to redeploy unless that soldier is reexamined. 
   It's almost like having shaking baby syndrome is what Mrs. Eckhart said to me, where after a baby has been damaged, unless they are really examined, sometimes you can't tell that there has been brain damage. It's no different for our soldiers. She begged me to change the policy of the Department of Defense in this regard. 
   In addition to that, I met so many soldiers who had come home because the unit returned in 2005, who had other symptoms that are not being treated. There is PTSD inside this particular battalion, but are doctors easily available to them? No. And are they available locally? No. If they are forced to travel somewhere because they are Reserve members, they have got to take off work. Guess what. They have to lose their pay because they have to go to get taken care of at a hospital 2, 3, 4 hours away from them. That's wrong. Those services should be provided to our soldiers when they are ill, particularly if they have something like PTSD, which demands such careful attention from a neuropsychiatrist and the distribution of medicines and the kind of therapeutic care that is important for them. 
   Another soldier came up to me. He had ripped cartilage and tendons in his knee. He has been home for over 1 1/2 years. He said, Congresswoman, why didn't the DOD operate on me while I was in theater? He said, When I came home, they discharged me. He said, You know what? I came home. I am now in the Reserve. For me to get this taken care of, I will be off work for week. He said, I can't afford to do that. He said, Why didn't they tell me? Why didn't they tell me to take care of it while I was under the umbrella of the Department of Defense? 
   The PTSD and neurological disorders just in that unit, now that people have been home, while we were at the ceremony, several F-16 jets which are based near a school overhead, you could just see the reaction of the soldiers. 
   I would invite the President of the United States to urge the Senate of the United States to move that legislation so that we can move the resources we need into the Department of Veterans Affairs and take care of the veterans of this country, over 100,000 of whom have come home now who are injured.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the American people are crying out. The story in my district is no different than across our country. As gas prices continue to rise, Washington is deadlocked. The energy crisis is sapping our economic future coast to coast. Consolidation in the oil industry is putting a tourniquet on the heart of the American economy. 
   In 1983, the United States consumed about 18 percent of the world's oil supply. Today, with the price of oil at over $135 a barrel, our share of world oil consumption has grown to over 25 percent. We only have 5 percent of the world's population, but we consume 25 percent of the global oil supply. 
   During the last 25 years, our country has gone from producing the majority of its oil domestically to importing most of our oil from abroad. So, since 1997, the United States' gluttony for oil has boiled over, and we've been consistently importing more than half of the oil we consume since the late 1990s. The increasing levels of oil importation have caused our structural deficit to skyrocket and have encouraged the creation of a pipeline that flows in the wrong direction--straight from the Middle East. 
   This pipeline is not carrying back our finished cars or windmills or solar arrays, but, instead, hundreds of billions of dollars every year from the American people's pockets are going to some of the most undemocratic regimes in the world. 
   The GAO has recently come to a conclusion which is obvious to the American people. As oil companies continue to consolidate, the price of oil spikes. The GAO report shows that, for the seven large mergers they modeled, five led to increased prices. Especially with the ExxonMobil and MAP-UDS oil merger, gas prices have increased upwards of 2 cents a gallon. Since 1976, not a single refinery has been built in this country, and between 1991 and 2000, over 2,600 mergers in all segments of the U.S. petroleum industry have destroyed competition. 
   As fewer players control bigger segments of the industry, the American people lose. ExxonMobil reports earnings of $40 billion in a single year, and as the price of gasoline increases, these firms merge into even larger and larger conglomerates. 
   This week, we passed into law a farm bill with over $1 billion of incentives to begin converting a portion of our market to biofuels. That is long overdue. With gasoline prices reaching toward $5 a gallon, it's time for action here in Washington. The other body and the President should join us in passing H.R. 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy Act and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008, and a renewable energy portfolio standard to bring these new energy technologies into our Nation's grid. While our House of Representatives has acted on these bills, we really need a commitment from the other part of this institution and up Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   As this summer's driving season begins, Americans will be brutally reminded that energy innovation will never materialize unless we develop public policy that prevents the big oil companies from manipulating and from controlling our market. In fact, we really lost control in 1998 when over half of our market came from someplace else. From investigations into the futures market to a comprehensive antitrust policy, we can get rid of the corruption, manipulation and speculation that have driven the cost of oil higher and higher to a point where many of our people simply cannot afford it. The way out of this is innovation and invention, and these very same companies should not throttle that invention in this country. In fact, they should be investing in it themselves. 
   This government needs to take a lead in helping every American, if they so choose, to become a producer on the roofs of their houses and in the fields in their regions. We could have wind farms, geothermal, fuel cells, biofuels, cryogenic hydrogen. All of these are a part of America in the 21st century. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's really difficult to be a Member of Congress and to see the future and yet not be able to gain a majority of votes in both Chambers and the real leadership of the President of the United States to meet this critical national need. America's energy dependence is our largest strategic vulnerability. It's time that we stopped trying to bring in oil from every place else on the globe and, rather, become energy independent here at home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. With the highest regard for the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, I rise, regrettably, in opposition to this closed rule and against the bailout bill. 
   We need the right deal, not a fast deal. The White House is counting on fear to propel this Congress into hasty and inappropriate action on a Wall Street bailout that is not in the interest of our Republic. There is a better way. In fact, it is as likely the expenditure of $700 billion will actually stand in the way of the most effective means to remedy the economic challenges facing us. 
   The Bush administration says we are facing the worst financial crisis in modern history. That is not true. The market problems of the 1980s were much worse than today. Then, 3,000 banks failed; interest rates were at 21 percent; money center banks went down; every bank in Texas went down. But the economic instability was resolved in the financial system in a much more disciplined and rigorous way than taxpayers printing money for Wall Street. 
   In those days, the FDIC, not through a taxpayer bailout, but through careful use of FDIC's considerable power, resolved thousands of problem situations. No cash changed hands. A system of net worth certificates issued by FDIC was used to get through the credit shortage. FDIC regulated transactions with banks, through a system of subordinated debentures and promissory notes, was enacted. FDIC assumed power over executive salaries and controlled dividends to restore health and rigor to the market. 
   The FDIC adopted a contingency plan to nationalize all institutions in the event it was necessary. The cost of the entire enterprise was $1.8 billion, resolving over $100 billion in problem institutions from the FDIC insurance fund, paid for by the banks, not the taxpayers. In other words, the market was used to heal the market, not set up a big government bureaucracy at the U.S. Treasury, run and overseen by the very reckless people who caused these problems in the first place. 
   Today's economic challenge is a credit crisis, not a liquidity crisis. This bill does not address that. The housing bubble that burst is at the heart of our dilemma. Until Main Street housing foreclosures are remedied, the situation will not improve. This bill does not address the serious mortgage workout and mortgage servicing challenges facing Main Streets across this Nation. 
   Taking a trillion dollars of taxpayer money and buying bushels of unknown and unvalued paper is not smart. It will delay resolution of that housing crisis. In fact, this bill actually asks taxpayers to buy a garbage truckload of worthless paper, everything from subprime auto loans, to foreign bank loans, to hedge fund paper, to credit swaps. Every reckless Wall Street deal thought up these past several years they want to dump on us. We say: No. 
   Now, this bill also does nothing for reform, for example, to address the shortcomings of the SEC, which has done more than any other regulatory body to cause this problem by its false accounting, overinflated leverage ratios, and by destroying fair value accounting.

   High financial crimes have been committed. Now Congress is being asked to bail out the culprits and to do so at the expense of those who elected us to guard their interests--the people of our country. 
   The normal legislative process that should accompany the review of a monumental proposal to bail out Wall Street has been shelved--yes, shelved. Only a few insiders are doing the dealing. It sounds like insider trading to me. 
   These criminals have so much political power that they can shut down the normal legislative process of the highest law-making body in this land. All of the committees that should be scanning every word of what is being negotiated are benched, and that means the American people are benched, too. 
   We are constitutionally sworn to protect and to defend this Republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic. My friends, there are enemies. We are told we will have a bill, a $1 trillion bill, to review soon, and will have less than 24 hours with no regular hearings to try to vote on this bramblebush. 
   The people pushing this deal are the very same ones who were responsible for the implosion on Wall Street. They were fraudulent then and they're fraudulent now. We should say ``no'' to this deal. I ask my colleagues to join us at 2 o'clock in HC-8 of the Capitol to meet with some real experts who have done financial resolutions without putting the burden on the taxpayer. 
   Please join us in HC-8 at 2 p.m.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TREASURY SECRETARY PAULSON AND THE SUBPRIME MARKET -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, there was an article recently in Information Clearing House urging our country's leaders to exhibit leadership in these  times of economic crisis. And it was such a compelling article, I wanted to read part of it into the Record tonight. 
   It talks about some of the recent bloodbaths that we have seen on Wall Street that prove the trouble in our credit markets have not been relieved by the Fed's rate cuts. The Dow Jones slipped 367 points on the 20th anniversary of Black Monday, the stock market's biggest 1-day loss in history. And in the past week or so, Asian markets have plunged. Stocks are down sharply in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea. And there are ongoing problems being caused by what is happening in our subprime housing lending market. 
   ``The sudden downturn in our stock market has provided a fitting backdrop for Treasury Secretary Paulson's appearance at the G-7 meetings here in Washington. Paulson has largely shrugged off the decline in housing and the growing volatility in the equities markets. 
   ``What everyone at the meetings really wanted to know was why the United States destabilized the global economic system by selling hundreds of billions of dollars of worthless mortgage-backed securities to banks and pension funds around the world. 
   ``Aren't there any regulations in the United States,'' they asked? ``And how is Paulson going to make amends to the institutions and investors who lost their shirts in this massive mortgage scheme?'' Unfortunately, the Treasury Secretary didn't address any of these questions. He offered no recommendations for fixing the problem. Indeed, I can tell you the Treasury Department isn't even offering public television ads and commercial ads in communities like my own that are suffering under the weight of these rising foreclosures. 
   Last month's net foreign influx of capital shows how quickly capital can evaporate when other countries lose confidence in us. In fact, foreign investors pulled $163 billion out of U.S. securities and treasuries in August alone. Net capital inflows into our country have turned negative. And that's money that won't be returning to the United States until we get our act together. 
   This multitrillion-dollar subprime swindle was the greatest financial fraud in history. But Paulson and his colleagues at the Fed continue to blame everyone else. No one in China or Iran could have cooked up this structured finance rip-off which sent millions of homeowners into foreclosure, shattered 160 mortgage lenders, and undermined the global banking system. That was the work of Wall Street and their accomplices at the Fed. 
   Another article appeared in the New York Times by economics reporter Gretchen Morgenson. She calls her article, ``Get Ready for the Big Squeeze.'' And she says, ``Anyone who thinks we've hit bottom in the increasingly scary lending world is paying little mind to the remarkably low levels of reserves that the big banks have set aside for themselves for loan losses. And who let that happen? Part of the problem for banks is the result of an almost two-decade drop in loan loss reserves.'' That's the fault of this Congress, it's the fault of the Treasury, and the fault of the Federal Reserve. 
   The present gang of Wall Street warlords have transformed the world's most transparent and resilient market, our own, into an opaque galaxy of complex dead instruments and shady, off-balance sheet operations. It's no better than a carnival shell game. 
   As the banks continue to get rocked from explosions in the housing industry, the unwinding derivatives and carry trades will precipitate a mass exodus from the equities markets. And we know that with surging oil and food prices, it's bearing down heavily on the American people as their discretionary income vanishes from increasing inflation and shrinking home equity. Wages have remained stagnant while personal savings have fallen to negative levels. 
   The aftershock from Alan Greenspan's cheap credit policies will be felt for decades. Record trade imbalances give further evidence of our situation. And no country has ever devalued its way to prosperity. As our dollar falls globally, destroying the dollar will ultimately destroy our country. And it will destroy the value of savings, for those people in this country that do have savings. It will destroy the value of equity they've built up in their homes. It will destroy the value of equities of this country. 
   Global credit markets are now facing unprecedented disruptions due to the mortgage-derivatives fraud which originated here in this country before spreading across the world; $400 billion in asset-backed commercial paper has failed to roll over, and the story is not over yet. 
   Mr. Speaker, leadership is critical in times of economic crisis. Yet this Congress seems to be tiptoeing around the magnitude of what is facing the people of this country. This isn't time for prevarication, obfuscation, or public relations gimmicks by the Secretary of Treasury or the Fed. We need leaders who will tell the truth and forestall the growing probability of social disorder. 
   I commend this article to my colleagues and to the American people.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week's rattling of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the failure of IndyMac Bank are the latest wreckage of our held-hostage economy enlarged to a trillion-dollar hole. When we think about what is happening, the seeds of the ruin were sown in the 1990s, and those who planted the seeds got rich while pushing America financially to the precipice. 
   The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act by Congress in 1999 contributed to our financial system's vulnerability. For the first time in a half a century, the firewall between banking and commerce was breached. I voted against abandoning Glass-Steagall, but the act passed overwhelmingly in this chamber by a vote of 362-57 and over in the other body, 90-8. 
   As a result, the American taxpayers are now being asked to bail out Wall Street. The biggest high-risk investment banks and some uninsured government instrumentalities are going right to the American people, where they said they would never go. As these risky practices were standardized, the question is, what happened to the regulatory bodies charged with maintaining the safety and soundness of our financial system? Why didn't Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exert due diligence and oversight? Where was Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision? 
   What happened to HUD's appraisal and underwriting standards, when in 1993 and mortgage letter 93-2, and then in 1994, in HUD's mortgage letter 94-54, HUD gave authority to lenders like Countrywide to approve their own loans and select their own appraisers. Assuming many of these loans were moved to market through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, why did their regulatory standards fall short? Who served on their boards of directors and voted for these high-risk practices? How much were those boards and executives compensated during those years when these risky practices proliferated? 
   Evidence is beginning to surface that many of those board members personally benefited from their own decisions. Well, through which domestic and international institutions were the original mortgage securitizations first moved? Which persons and which firms did it, and which regulatory agencies sanctioned the process?  
   Why did Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision fail to bat an eye when Superior Bank, one of the first institutions to embark on subprime lending, was earning 7 1/2 times the industry's average return on assets? Where was its Chicago Office of Thrift Supervision? When FDIC finally caught up and charged Superior in 2001, it was fined $450 million, the largest fine in U.S. history much. 
   But why haven't other hot-dog banks been brought to justice? This subprime crises happened because people at the highest levels wilted, they placed America in bondage for another generation. The gaming of our financial markets is not a new phenomenon, but each crisis seems to get bigger, and the big fish, the kingfish, aren't brought to justice. 
   All the men and women who served on the boards of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae during the 1990s and voted for these high-risk practices should be investigated. They made millions off their stock options and industry connections. Are they to remain anonymous to the American people who are being asked to pick up their horse dung after the parade has gone through town? Who were they, and how did their votes, as board members, contribute to this unfolding American tragedy? 
   I am going to place in the Record tonight the list of all the board members at Freddie Mac from the early nineties until the early 2000s and will be placing the same names in the Record for Fannie Mae in future days. 
   Let me just say that the trillion-dollars debt that is being proposed to be financed through the sale of U.S. bonds, let me remind the American people, our coffers are empty as a country. Our country will borrow more money from foreign interests to close this gap, and our children will owe principal and interest to the bondholders, just as they paid nearly a quarter trillion dollars on the savings and loan crises from the 1980s. 
   Let me remind you the meaning of the word ``bondage,'' a state of being bound, captive, a serve, subjugated to a controlling person or force, subservient, dependent, a bond slave, a lackey. 
   What is happening to our country is truly very, very dangerous. This never should have happened, and every single person responsible at the highest levels in this government, who did not regulate, who did not have oversight, who did not properly manage their regulatory systems in order to guard against this kind of risk-prone behavior, should be investigated, and the American people should know whose bill they are paying for. What a tremendous tragedy for our country.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the American taxpayers know that they are now the insurance company for Wall Street and for Wall Street's high-risk investors. 
   I am very pleased to begin this evening joined by our dear and respected colleague from the great City of Cleveland, Congressman DENNIS KUCINICH, and would yield the first portion of the hour and such time as he may consume on the very important subject of the mortgage foreclosure crisis and the financial crisis facing our Nation.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Perhaps I could point out on the map, of course, Cleveland the most affected region of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, if we look back to 1997, here, and you just look at the colors alone, you have a sense of how many people are actually losing their homes in that region versus Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; my own region, the greater Toledo area. The change between 2007 and 1997 in the last decade, it's just, it's profound.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Absolutely, and each red dot on this map of Ohio represents 10 foreclosures. If we look at the same period of time and how many new filings are fueling this foreclosure growth, we can go back to 1997 and look at 21,000 filings every single year. The number increases to where last year there were over 83,230 filings. Many of those, the gentleman states, so-called subprime, concentrated in communities that were working class and poor. There was a targeting going on around this country.

   Ms. KAPTUR. If the gentleman, my dear friend Congressman Kucinich would agree with this, in many of those neighborhoods there literally were no regular banks. In other words, they red lined the community providing no decent financial institutions, leaving them with those payday cash checking or check cashing operations in those communities. 
   Then all of the money that would flow into those communities, whether it was Social Security for senior citizens who had worked, veterans disability benefits for people who had served our country, where would they take that check to cash it?     
   There was no place. It was redlined. So those dollars were systematically  removed. That's what redlining was about--their money systematically removed from those communities and put somewhere else--and then the very people in those communities couldn't get mortgage insurance for their homes, so they were sucked dry. That's why we had the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. It was to say, hey, people in these neighborhoods have savings; they have income; they shouldn't have to pay all this money to cash a check. Then when we made them abide by the law and treat every citizen with the respect they're due, they came up with the subprime gimmick.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. You know, it used to be that most people in this country, when they would get home loans, would go to financial institutions in their communities or in their neighborhoods if there were a financial institution. You had a person who would make a judgment about you. What was your character? What was the ability of that institution to collect the loan? What was your collateral? Character. Collateral. Collectibility. 
   Then back in the 1980s, we had this big savings and loan crisis, and the cost of keeping our financial system whole was dumped on the taxpayers of the United States. We have now paid a quarter of $1 trillion, $250 billion, going back to the 1980s. 
   What has happened in this crisis after the savings and loans were demolished--really, gotten rid of--is that in the 1990s, I can remember their saying, well, you know, we won't have that problem anymore because now we're going to create something new. It's called a mortgage-backed security, and Wall Street will solve our problem. We will never have a banking crisis again in the United States of America. We're going to create this cute, little paper instrument, and we're going to let Wall Street break up your mortgage into parts, and all these mortgage banks will have it, and then there won't be any one bank that will get in trouble, right? 
   So, during the 1990s, there was complete financial deregulation. We got rid of something called the Glass-Steagall Act, that goes back to President Roosevelt, where we separated banking from commerce, and they got rid of the appraisal standards of HUD in 1993 and 1994, and Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Office of Thrift Supervision at the Treasury Department didn't do their jobs. 
   What happened was these new securities moved from the local communities. Our local thrifts were gotten rid of--the agencies that created the mortgage instrument and helped people have savings accounts with real passbooks that earned interest. Then we started working with Wall Street, and your loan would go from your local communities--this is Countrywide right here. If we look at Angelo Mozilo, he didn't live in Cleveland or in Toledo. He made over $2.8 million.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. You know, the bankers who worked in our communities years ago, they didn't make that kind of money, and that doesn't count all of his stocks and everything else. Countrywide is one of the worst abusers, the worst abuser, in this scandal. 
   So, during the 1990s, the mortgage process became hooked to Wall Street. Then for the first time in American history, those mortgages, rather than being held by your local banks where you had to go in where they knew you and where they knew whether your father had a job or whatever else, were traded up to these anonymous institutions, to people who didn't even live in your community. Then they did something they'd never done before in American history. They sold them into the international market. 
   One of the real problems in places like Toledo and, I'm sure, in Cleveland, Congressman Kucinich, is that the workouts are very difficult to do because you're not sure who is the ultimate holder of your loan. How many of the millions of people being hurt by this go to the telephone and try to work out a deal with one of these companies? As for IndyMac, the company that just went belly-up last week, their CEO made a salary of $1 million, a bonus of $1 million, whatever. Now that institution from California is in trouble. Try to work out your loan. Who holds your paper? How do you get that person on the phone? 
   It's a totally anonymous, faceless system for millions of Americans, and it was meant to happen, and now the American people are being asked to become the insurance company for Wall Street--for investment banks and for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are not insured institutions of the Government of the United States of America--to the tune of who knows how much--$1 trillion? $2 trillion? $3 trillion?

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you also, Congressman Kucinich, for being a champion for Democratic capitalism. As to your point about the whole financial system's becoming unreachable and so concentrated, whatever happens here, the ordinary American family and the ordinary American community will benefit by whatever Congress does. 
   As I listen to what is being talked about in this Chamber and over in the Senate, one of my biggest worries is that very big institutions on Wall Street are going to be bailed out or are going to be propped up by the American taxpayer. 
   My question is: What does the American taxpayer get for that? Our Federal Housing Administration is literally going to become the insurance company for Wall Street. When these big Wall Street firms get all of these homes, how does the average American get in on this equation? 
   I'm putting in the Record tonight an article that was in The Observer. It talks about an effort to allow homeowners who are losing their homes at the local level to work with their local governments and local housing authorities to transfer those homes, perhaps, to them. Then in a lease-back provision, they would be able to pay that locality back for that home.  
   Credit crunch: Emergency Scheme To Help Cash-Strapped Homeowners  
   Homeowners struggling to meet their mortgage payments would be able to sell their homes to the local authority and rent them back as tenants under radical proposals being considered by the government to prevent the misery of repossession. 
   Emergency measures to allow families to keep a roof over their heads are being drawn up as the scale of repossessions proceedings becomes increasingly apparent. In Newcastle upon Tyne alone, the newly nationalised Northern Rock is monopolising at least one day a week in the county court to pursue defaulting borrowers. 
   The latest rescue package reflects growing fears about the seriousness of the crisis, with some analysts predicting that house prices could fall by 35 per cent. Ministers are worried about the 13 per cent of fixed-rate borrowers whose cheap deals expire this year, some of whom may by then be in negative equity and therefore unable to switch to a new fixed rate with another lender. 
   Caroline Flint, the Housing Minister, told The Observer yesterday: `I am looking at what more we can do with our colleagues in local authorities--what they can do as well as actually building [homes], and what support they could give to people who might be feeling under pressure on mortgages.' 
   Asked to confirm that she was considering rent-back schemes, enabling homeowners to become council tenants in their original houses rather than be repossessed, she said: `We are looking at that. I have to be certain that the choices I make do actually help to limit the damage; and, importantly, is it a short-term fix or a long-term impact?' 
   The scheme be expensive. Councils would need central government funds to buy the houses. But it could save on the long-term costs of rehousing homeless families and allow councils to increase their housing stock at relatively low prices. 
   Flint also suggested the Bank of England could increase the size of its u50bn fund designed to stimulate mortgage lending, admitting she was `disappointed' that the cash that has been pumped in so far had not led to cheaper home loans. `No doubt our colleagues in the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee will also be looking at the issue in terms of whether any extra has to be provided,' she added. 
   She has suggested that country landowners could be freed to build cheap houses for their workers on their own land, in a return to the system of `tied cottages'. 
   `It's recognising that sense of community and how everybody has a part to play,' she said. 
   Debt advice experts warned yesterday that, despite the Chancellor's calls for leniency from lenders, Northern Rock was now aggressively pursuing defaulting borrowers as part of its efforts to repay the u25bn rescue package it received from the government. Chris Jary, director of Action for Debt in Durham, said: `There used to be a small group of sub-prime lenders who you knew would always go straight to court. But recently it's Northern Rock who have become more aggressive, taking legal action as soon as they can.' 
   House repossessions at Northern Rock are running at twice the rate they were before the bank was nationalised in February.  
   Rather than Wall Street's making all the money in their bond houses, why don't we use the bonding power of our cities and of our housing authorities to help move some of that money back down rather than move the money out, back up again to Wall Street?

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for raising these points and also to say that, when you have a system of debt, certain people get very, very wealthy. These are some of the people who got very, very wealthy. 
   Whether it was Mr. Mozilo of Countrywide or, of course, Michael Perry from IndyMac, which went broke, or Richard Carrion from Popular, these men were making millions and millions of dollars. This doesn't even include the big bond houses on Wall Street. Bear Stearns was the first one to go belly up. 
   Now we're asking our government to prop up the risky investment practices of Wall Street and to reward the very bondsmen who have placed the American people in the position of servant hood. They make out in terms of selling their bonds and by indebting the people of the United States. They get their fees. 
   What is amazing to me is that, if you look at the list of the bonding houses that got us in this fix--if you look at Countrywide--would you believe, even though our government knew what it was doing, it kept them on the list of primary securities dealers at the U.S. Treasury Department? HSBC, one of the primary violators, is on the list of primary dealers of the Federal Reserve. 
   You start looking down that list and start saying to yourself, hey, wait a minute. What is this, a circle? They all just circle the wagons. They are the same people who cause the trouble. Then they come to the American taxpayer to bail them out. 
   Congressman Kucinich talked about the Roosevelt administration and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was not just about bailing out Wall Street. What was interesting about what President Roosevelt did was that he created a special jobs program. If you look at what that Reconstruction Finance Corporation really did, people around America got work. There was a homeowners' loan association for cities and then a farm credit administration for homeownership in the countryside. 
   The Works Progress Administration, the WPA, built infrastructure across  this country--zoos and libraries and highways. Yes, they did prop up Wall Street, but they created new types of savings institutions, not to create debt but to create equity, to say to the American family, ``Look, you can own a home. Here is a passbook.'' These are savings and loan institutions. You would get a passbook. You could put money in there. You would actually get an interest rate worth something--4 or 5 percent a year. People learned a savings habit.     
   Tell me the last time you got a letter from a financial institution in this country asking you to save. All you get are credit cards. ``Get this loan, zero percent down.'' I keep a stack. I've got it in my office. It's about this high. If I signed up for all of those credit cards, I couldn't even manage to keep in touch with all of them. The debt posture that these institutions have pushed have helped push America to the precipice. And every American who's listening knows what I'm talking about. 
   It is not an accident that we are in this situation. The entire financial system was turned inside-out during the 1990s. We got rid of something called the Glassed Eagle Act which had been in existence from the time of Roosevelt that said you can't mix banking with commerce. You can't mix banking and commerce with real estate. They have to be separate because there are too many bad things that can happen because you know what? Some people are very greedy. They are very, very greedy. And some people don't have information to make informed financial decisions. 
   So we are now inheriting a situation here which is very, very serious. And today in the Financial Times--and I will place this in the RECORD this evening as well, and then my colleague would like to assume her role here; when she is comfortable, we will move to that--but the Financial Times had an article called ``Goodbye capitalism'' by Joshua Rosner. And what he said is, ``We have nationalized the losses from Bear Stearns,'' which is an investment bank, not a regular savings bank, ``through a transfer of risk onto the Federal Government's balance sheet and have now nationalized the losses generated by Fannie's and Freddie's poor management and functionally taken $5 million in obligations on to the government's balance sheet.'' 
   That means not just us, our children and grandchildren are going to pay for generations. And that makes the bond houses on Wall Street so happy because they make money while the American people suffer. 
   The article says, ``we will see the continued nationalization of bad assets, placing the burden on the shoulders of the already overburdened American taxpayer. 
   ``We have done this without forcing the disgorgement of undeserved gains by the management and without replacing managements who are now controlling government-owned businesses. Instead of protecting those who made bad bets, we should use our rule of law to address the situation.'' We need a special investigatory panel with subpoena authority to look at every single person back through the 1990s who helped place America and her families in this situation. 
   The article says, ``Rather than making the taxpayer liable for debts and debts of the government-sponsored enterprises, it would be more sensible to effect a smooth, prepackaged reorganization plan.'' But you know what? That's not in the bill that is likely to be considered here soon. They just want the money, but they don't want to reorganize the system in order to prevent further damage in the future. 
   We're being pushed by the Bush administration: Do this now because the markets are really nervous, but we won't get the reform that we need in order to avoid these crises in the future. We're merely going to reward bad behavior and put the American people at risk. 
   ``As part of a prepackaged reorganization,'' the article goes on to say, ``the government could explicitly assure investors they will receive all of their guaranteed interest payments. Instead of giving ineffective management a line of credit,'' which is what the bill proposes to do, ``Treasury could provide the GSE's regulator with a line of credit used to assure timely payments for these obligations. This is the tool that Treasury provides the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with to sort out failed banks.'' That's what Roosevelt used. 
   ``Over time that line will be repaid by the running-off of the portfolios, active servicing of mortgages and through payment of claims by private mortgage insurers who guaranteed first losses on GSE mortgages. 
   ``The next step would create $150 billion in new equity capital and enable the GSEs, without governmental support, to achieve more fully their chartered mission. Over the past decade'' Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac ``have increasingly used their portfolios to speculate,'' and this is the first time I have read this, ``in aircraft leasing, manufactured housing, interest-only mortgages, and other securities they are specifically prohibited from buying as part of their financial mission. 
   ``In recent years, through these portfolios they funded nearly 50 percent of the riskier private label alternate Alt-A mortgage market, invested in aircraft, lease securities, manufactured housing and other assets that leveraged them into trouble. To achieve the speculative, hedge fund-like growth they issued almost $1.500 billion of senior corporate debt. By their investments, debt buyers supported speculation in non-mission-related activities and did so with a clear understanding they with funding non-mission-related activities. 
   ``They also knew GSE debt was explicitly not an obligation of the U.S. taxpayer and that was repeated constantly by the government and the companies. 
   ``In exchange for their current debt, these holders should receive 90 cents on the dollar of new, long-dated senior debt in the companies and 10 cents of new subordinated debt.'' 
   ``This approach would send a very strong signal, from the government, that investors fully consider the risks of bad asset allocation.'' And ``though it would cause pain for equity and subordinated debt investors, those investors received the majority of returns over the past several years and, in our great system, they are supposed to be subordinated.'' 
   I want to put this article in the RECORD. I think it is very, very well written. 
   And I go back to my initial question for this evening. I wonder if the American taxpayer knows they are now the insurance company for Wall Street and Wall Street's high-risk investors. We have to figure out a way, as we work our way out of this serious situation, for some of the dollars that are being directed to Wall Street, rewarding them, in a sense, for their behavior, go the other way back to community and that mayors and that local housing authorities be provided with the kind of wherewithal it's going to take to rescue our local housing markets and to create the kind of mortgage activity at the local level that will help lift our real estate industry, that will help prevent further foreclosures of our families and that will help people, face-to-face at the local level again, assure that that housing market is more secure than we have had with this very indirect, anonymous kind of relationship that has resulted from this mortgage-backed security industry that we moved into in the 1990s. 
   I would like to ask the extraordinarily qualified and engaged chairwoman of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee of Financial Institutions who's worked so hard on this issue, Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS of California, to assume her time this evening and perhaps to give us further insight on what the committee is about and what we, as a Congress and the American people, might do to help us help ourselves as a country right the ship of our economic state. 
   Congresswoman Waters, thank you so much for joining us this evening. Thank you for your extraordinary efforts as a Chairwoman and for bringing your committee to Ohio to witness what we are dealing with there is emblematic of what is happening across this country. Thank you for joining.  
   Goodbye Capitalism  
   In a capitalist economy, losers are expected to take losses and winners to gain. Private enterprise is best able to allocate  capital efficiently and, where it fails to do so, markets make adjustments and capital is reallocated to efficient users. This basic tenet supports good and productive assets moving from the hands of weak players to stronger. Where this is not possible, the U.S. system gives the government a hand in fostering that move through an efficient process called bankruptcy or reorganisation. This rule of markets and of law has always been the basis of our national supremacy in innovation and the reason ours was the world's clear choice of a reserve currency. That was the world we lived in previously. 
   Our elected officials have repeatedly demonstrated that even equity holders, who are supposed to have the most subordinated claims on assets, cannot be allowed to take losses and instead believe we should all communally share in losses that result from poor allocation and risk management decisions. We have nationalised the losses from Bear Stearns through a transfer of risk on to the federal government's balance sheet and have now nationalised the losses generated by Fannie's and Freddie's poor management and functionally taken $5 trillion in obligations on to the government's balance sheet. This has been done even though every equity or debt offering of Fannie and Freddie explicitly states that these ``are not guaranteed by the U.S. and do not constitute an obligation of the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality thereof other than'' of Fannie or Freddie. 
   By the time we are finished with this tragic period in U.S. economic history, the government is likely to have to choose whether to do the same for at least one more large bank, investment bank, bond insurer, mortgage insurer, multiple large regional bank, airline or car manufacturer. Given the choices we have seen from officials, who obviously have little faith in the ability of capital markets or our system of law, we will see the continued nationalisation of bad assets, placing the burden on the shoulders of the already overburdened American taxpayer. 
   This commitment by misguided officials to print more money, to stoke the embers of inflation and to debase further our already hobbled currency invites foreign investors to pick through our assets and buy our remaining strong businesses (Anheuser Busch) on the cheap. As the strength of our remaining industries is further weakened, along with taxpayers' buying power, it will become increasingly necessary, as a matter of survival, for American workers to demand increases in their wages. 
   While some might applaud the government's policy action, it will prevent the rational and orderly repricing of over inflated assets, ensure they remain overvalued, uneconomic and unaffordable to a populous that will see an increasing percentage of their wages allocated for the support of our national debt. We have done this without forcing the disgorgement of undeserved gains by managements and without replacing managements who are now controlling government ``owned'' businesses. 
   The same economists who have repeatedly argued efficient market theory have chosen this path. Instead of protecting those who made bad bets, we should use our rule of law to address the situation. That would mean we allow weak players either to fail or to reorganise through an orderly transfer of good assets from weak hands to strong hands. This would protect the once-mighty U.S. dollar and affect the necessary and repricing of assets to sustainable equilibrium. Doing so would also decrease moral hazard and send a strong message of faith in our great system as the model for global financial advancement. 
   There is another option in relation to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Rather than making the taxpayer liable for debts the debts of the government-sponsored enterprises, it would be more sensible to effect a smooth, prepackaged reorganisation plan. This could be done quite simply and would strengthen the GSEs' ability to meet their congressionally mandated purpose of supporting liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. 
   The core of the GSEs' mission is to purchase mortgages from mortgage originators, charge a guarantee fee to issuers to protect their ability to stand behind these loans, and securitise these mortgage-backed securities with assurances to MBS holders they would receive 100 per cent of their anticipated returns. To this end the GSEs have guaranteed $3.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. These securities are backed by real housing assets and there is little question that, assuming they are well serviced, there will be relatively little loss over a longer period. 
   As part of a prepackaged reorganisation the government could explicitly assure MBS investors they will receive all of their guaranteed interest payments. Instead of giving ineffective management a line of credit, Treasury could provide the GSEs, regulator with a line of credit used to assure timely payments on these obligations. This is the tool that Treasury provides the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with to sort out failed banks. Over time that line will be repaid by the running-off of the portfolios, active servicing of mortgages and through payment of claims by private mortgage insurers who guaranteed first losses on GSE mortgages. Because these debts are core to the GSEs' social mission and real assets back these debts, this would be an appropriate resolution. 
   The next step would create approximately $150bn in new equity capital and enable to GSEs, without governmental support, to achieve more fully their chartered mission. 
   Over the past decade the GSEs have increasingly used their portfolios to speculate in aircraft leasing, manufactured housing, interest-only mortgages and other securities they are specifically prohibited from buying as part of their mission. In recent years, through these portfolios they funded nearly 50 per cent of the riskier private label Alt-A mortgage market, invested in aircraft lease securities, manufactured housing and other assets that leveraged them into trouble. To achieve this speculative, hedge fund-like growth they issued almost $1,500bn of senior corporate debt. By their investments, debt buyers supported speculation in non-mission-related activities and did so with a clear understanding they were funding non-mission-related activities. They also knew GSE debt was explicitly not an obligation of the U.S. taxpayer and that was repeated constantly by the government and the companies. 
   In exchange for their current debt, these holders should receive 90 cents on the dollar of new, long-dated, senior debt in the companies and 10 cents of new subordinated debt. The companies would then have enough capital to support their core, chartered mission and could increase the social returns and financial returns of investors in their core mission. This approach would send a very strong signal, from the government, that investors fully consider the risks of bad asset allocation. It would almost certainly strengthen the dollar. Though it would cause pain for equity and subordinated debt investors, those investors received the majority of returns over the past several years and, in our great system, they are supposed to be subordinated.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I congratulate you for that proposal. It is the only one I know that would stick to the wall locally. I know how hard Chairwoman Waters has fought to even get this embedded in this legislation, and I have to say to the people here tonight, when you think about $1 trillion or more, a $15 billion proposal is very, very modest. Our community development dollars for the whole country I think total about $8 billion a year. It's very, very modest. 
   Frankly, I wish you well and hope that you can expand that significantly because Wall Street will be rewarded with a $1 trillion bailout, and yet we're going to give our mayors and local housing authorities pennies to deal with the level of foreclosure that is being experienced across this country. I would think they would roll out the red carpet for you in that committee and do everything they could to help you make this bill not just efficient but equitable, particularly to the American taxpayers who are going to bear the brunt of this cost.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Frankly, thank you, Chairwoman Waters, for coming to Ohio. You were an oasis in a desert. You gave us hope by coming there and listening to us and allowing our people to put their stories of our communities, of what's going on in this mortgage market on the record. 
   And what is really disheartening about all of this is it seems that the financial system is getting so far away from community, from neighborhood, from our people, our people feel powerless to make a difference, and now you say these services are even over in India. Frankly, I had trouble with all this stuff moving to Wall Street and not being able to get a phone call returned when we're trying to do a workout at the local level. 
   We need to turn this financial system upside down, and I'm hoping that the chairman of the full committee is listening in this House and that whatever we do to bail out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these investment banks on Wall Street--and I have some problems with doing that. I'm not a happy traveler in this party here--that power devolves back to the local level, that however this financial system is rearranged, that we go back to character, collateral, and collectibility, the old principles when we had a system that functioned well at the local level, and re-empower communities to handle their housing systems. 
   This system we have now has given us a multi-trillion dollar disaster. How can anybody say when you move away from home, so far away, how can that be good, when our people feel powerless to make a difference? Our mayors feel powerless. Our communities, our credit unions, the Realtors, how can this system be good when it so disempowers?

   Ms. KAPTUR. I would say to the chairwoman, you mentioned about what happened to regulation, and one of the first institutions to embark on sub-prime lending was Superior Bank of Hinsdale, Illinois, ultimately bought by Charter Bank from Ohio. And Superior was created by the Resolution Trust Corporation when the savings and loans collapsed in the 1980s, but by the late 1990s, Superior's return on assets--now, think about this--was 7 1/2 times the industry average and held a very risky portfolio. It had a CAMEL rating of two, and yet its executives were financially rewarded for presiding over ruin. 
   How could America let that happen? No Federal regulator stepped in to properly examine the industry institution. What happened to the Office of Thrift Supervision over at Treasury and its Chicago office?

   Ms. KAPTUR. They closed their eyes, and it wasn't until 2001, because this was one of the leading institutions to invent the sub-prime instrument when they collapsed, and they couldn't meet the calls of people coming in for their money, that FDIC started investigating and placed the largest fine in American history, $450 million, a half a billion dollars, on one institution. Where is the investigation now?     
   You read a little bit about what the FBI is doing; you read a little bit about what FDIC is doing. We need a massive investigation of which institutions led us into this subprime crisis that the country is facing. Who was the first one? I've asked everybody, who was the first one? Give me the first three or four. And through which institutions did they broker those loans and how did they get to Wall Street? Nobody knows. Nobody knows; or else they're not saying. 
   Where was the Office of Thrift Supervision? What happened to HUD's appraisal and underwriting standards? Assuming many of these loans were moved to market through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, why did their regulatory standards and HUD's oversight fall short? Why did HUD change its appraisal and underwriting practices in 1993 and 1994? 
   How were the boards and executives in these entities compensated during those years when the risky practices proliferated? Because it isn't just these fellows, it's the people in the regulatory agencies and the government secondary market enterprises that were involved. Which board members at which financial institutions and brokerages, regulators and secondary market bodies voted to allow these risky and predatory policies that escalated this equity drawdown? Do we have evidence that any of those board members personally benefited from their board decisions? 
   Through which domestic and international institutions were the original securitizations first moved? Which persons did it? Which regulatory agencies sanctioned the process? What role did the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of Thrift Supervision play--the Securities and Exchange Commission, how about the Federal Reserve--in allowing these practices to flourish? 
   I say to the chairwoman, I know the great work that you have done. There should be many committees in this institution involved in unraveling what has happened before we're asked to do a trillion dollar bailout here in the Congress of the United States. 
   You know, it's sort of interesting to me that even the New York Times editorialized that we've got to do this right now; you Congress, you pass a trillion dollars more--or who knows how much--because these institutions are too big to fail. And therefore, we can't do due diligence; we can't make good decisions for the American people. I can't even tell my constituents today--I hope I can find out by Thursday or Friday or Saturday this week--what exactly is in the bill that is being  written somewhere here so that I can see exactly how much money has to be appropriated and how big the drawdown will be from the Federal Reserve. Right now we don't know. There isn't a final bill that is available to the Members. I know it's being worked on somewhere in this place. I hope that there is a regular markup session by the respective committees that have to be involved here and an open rules process.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Well, Madam Chair, that is really good news. And I know that you have been the strongest voice in the committee to try to strengthen the bill. We from Ohio are doing everything possible to even make it stronger, and to make sure that the communities that have been ravaged by this subprime crisis--and I include my own among them--that somehow that those who are in the lead in these various committees in the House here think about democratic capitalism, and not just empowering Wall Street, but thinking of ways to move the billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of insurance that will benefit the bond houses that helped get us in this mess in the first place, think about the bonding power of cities, think about the bonding power of our housing authorities at the local level, think about how to move some of that money to re-empower communities across this country, not just a pittance, but at least have a scale of justice. If you're going to reward Wall Street, the wrongdoers who helped get us in this mess, what are you going to do for Main Street that's paying the bill? Are you going to give them a pittance? 
   I come from a tradition in a party with Franklin Roosevelt who believed you empower at the grass roots level and that you build wealth from the bottom up, not reward the top. And I would hope that there would be balance in the bill that is brought before us as we move into this debate. And I would hope there would be a chance at least to offer amendments, at least to be welcomed into the committee. We don't want to delay the process, but that if we have ideas, we have the respect that should be given to Members who come from affected communities and States. 
   And I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her gracious acceptance of the invitation of the bipartisan delegation from Ohio. We feel, as so many people do, very frustrated by how slow the wheels of government sometimes turn and what is happening out there in community after community, where people are not able to do their workouts. I would hope that the chairman of the full committee here in the House, Mr. Frank, who has been meeting with some of the Members and been very involved in the committee, I hope that he would share his draft bill ahead of time because I think it would be disastrous--and I speak only for myself when I say this--if a bill is rushed to the floor and we don't have a chance to review it. This is too important. 
   When we're talking $100 million, that's a lot of money. A billion dollars is a lot of money. When you get into the trillions, it's overwhelming. And we are here to do due diligence for our people, so please afford us the respect and the consideration that you would want for yourself, and that we actually have a responsibility for that due diligence for the American people, the people that sent us here.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PRESIDENT'S COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM A FAILURE IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last week when Pope Benedict XVI visited our Nation's Capital and then the United Nations, he inspired America and the world by invoking the moral imperatives of peace, justice and human rights. In greeting the Pope to America, President Bush dusted off his message of ``compassionate conservatism,'' which has lain dormant for 8 years since the Bush-Cheney campaigns of 2000. 
   President Bush said as the Pope sat there, ``Here in America, you will find a Nation of compassion. Americans believe that the measure of a free society is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us.'' The President said, ``So each day citizens across America answer the universal call to feed the hungry and comfort the sick and care for the infirm.'' 
   The President might be correct that American citizens try to fulfill these moral obligations of feeding the hungry and comforting the sick, but they are doing it with no help from his administration. Surely his administration has been conservative, but not compassionate. 
   The United States Government under George W. Bush has turned its back on the hungry. Ask any person who handles a food bank in this Nation. They took one program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and totally eliminated it, a program that feeds our Nation's hungriest. And while food pantries across our Nation are short and donations way down, the President turns a blind eye and utters those false words before the Pope. 
   The United States Government under George W. Bush has turned its back on the sick and the infirm. It was he who vetoed the children's health program and has since failed to provide health care for so many millions of our Nation's children whose families are working but still have no health insurance. 
   If the measure of a President is how his administration has treated the weakest and most vulnerable among us, then George W. Bush has failed the test of that leadership. 
   Here at home we have people converging on food pantries that are not able to cope with the demand. We have young people unable to find summer jobs, find it difficult to get student loans, and even more difficult to get a job to pay them off. We have families that lack health insurance. We have 10 seniors waiting for every one available affordable housing unit. And we have veterans in dilapidated facilities without the proper health care and support they need to rebuild their lives when they return home. This in a land where President Bush says, ``Each of us is willed and each of us is loved.'' 
   Mortgage foreclosures have a death grip on our economy, yet Washington continues to drag its feet on a solution with real bite. An estimated 1.6 million foreclosures occurred in 2007, and as of December, 2.9 million loans were past due, signaling that the worst is in front of us. This means that more than 40 million homeowners are at risk of seeing their property values decline as a result. And by early 2009 as many as 12.5 million homeowners will have no equity in their homes or will owe more than their homes are worth. In fact, America today is experiencing something it never has before, negative net equity in home mortgages. The value of the home is less than what people owe. 
   Where is the Bush administration? I invite the President to Ohio. Help us get these mortgage servicers to a table so we can do workouts. Where is HUD? Where is the Federal Reserve? Where are all these regulatory agencies? Where are they? Where is the President? 
   States and localities are struggling because of the Federal Government's absence in this area of workouts, and municipalities' tax bases may drop as much as $356 billion over the next 2 years, further undermining their ability to provide vital services for strapped residents because their tax bases are going down as a result of declining property values. 
   We have had the largest home equity washout in U.S. history. And what is the Bush response? To transfer $29 billion to bail out Bear Stearns, a Wall Street fast buck operation which is a Federal Reserve favorite and a primary dealer of U.S. Government securities. Yet nothing is done to help the States where these foreclosure crises are going on every day, to help America's families reposition so that they don't lose their major asset. 
   Yes, the Bush administration is conservative, but it is not compassionate.  
   In the Middle East, the Bush invasion of Iraq has yielded over 5 million refugees. The President has done nothing to help those displaced refugees have some semblance of a decent life. A million and a half Iraqis have fled to Syria alone. 
   Mr. Speaker, justice demands more than individual charity. It demands justice of us as a rich and powerful Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commemorate the life of Sergeant Keith Allen Kline, born and raised in Oak Harbor, Ohio. 
   Sergeant Kline was serving his second tour of duty when he was mortally wounded while on patrol in Baghdad on July 5, 2007, the day after the 4th of July, his favorite holiday. Today, Sergeant Kline was laid to rest following a fitting and moving ceremony at his alma mater Oak Harbor High School. Through my words this evening, America honors his memory and comforts his family. After the ceremony today, he was laid to rest at Oak Harbor's Union Cemetery.  
   In his poem, the Psalm of Life, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow writes: 
   ``Lives of great men all remind us 
   We can make our lives sublime, 
   And, departing, leave behind us 
   Footprints on the sands of time;-- 
   Footprints, that perhaps another, 
   Sailing o'er life's solemn main, 
   A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, 
   Seeing, shall take heart again. 
   Let us, then, be up and doing, 
   With a heart for any fate; 
   Still achieving, still pursuing, 
   Learn to labor and to wait.'' 
   Sergeant Kline lived the spirit of this message. The poem's words served as an epitaph as we recall his life and honor his ultimate sacrifice. 
   Keith Kline graduated from Oak Harbor High School in 2002. A talented wrestler, he placed in the top six wrestlers in Ohio during his high school years, a truly magnificent achievement from a large State like Ohio. He also played soccer and football and participated in school plays. He enlisted in the U.S. Army post-9/11 following his graduation. 
   At Fort Gordon, Georgia he completed his advanced individual training and was assigned to Bravo Company, 96th Civil Air Battalion, 95th Civil Affairs Brigade. In Iraq 3 months, he was assigned to the Civil Affairs Team supporting the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. In his brief career, his distinguished service brought him four Army achievement medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terror Expeditionary medal and Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and Basic Parachutist Badge. His death brought him the posthumous award of the Purple Heart Award, Bronze Star Medal, and Combat Action Badge. 
   More than a soldier, Keith Kline was known as a goodhearted person that was full of life and a very hard worker. Every single individual who paid him tribute this morning used the term ``a man of great heart.'' He was a NASCAR fan, too, and he reveled in family get-togethers. And his favorite holiday, as I mentioned, was the 4th of July. 
   Cherishing his memory and celebrating the gift of life are his mother Betty, brother John, stepfather, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and true friends he held close to his heart. We offer them our sincere condolences and heartfelt gratitude as they struggle through this very difficult time. May they find comfort in their loved one's memory, and recall the words of Ecclesiastes 3:1, ``To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under Heaven.'' 
   Today, America salutes Sergeant Keith Kline, a valiant son of our Republic, for his patriotism, for his excellence in service, for his courage, and for loving us more than he loved life itself.

A lifelong farmer, along with his wife, Eleanor, his brother, Ray, and his wife, Thelma, farmed over 1,000 acres as their father had before them. And the Zwyer family, and Howard, carried on an ethic of stewardship of our land, of husbandry, soil conservation and community mindedness that surely is not equaled by any other American. 
   He was 83. He lived to be 83, and he died within a mile of his birthplace. He and his brother, Ray, and their father, John, began growing corn, soybeans and wheat in the early years, even raising beef cattle. 
   Now, their father died in 1963, and the brothers took over. And they loved the land. When he retired formally from agriculture, he gardened and shared the produce with others. He really needed to work with the soil. It was part of him. And he never complained about being a farmer. 
   Mr. Zwyer retired formally about 20 years ago, and his brother died in 2002. I can tell you, they represented agriculture in Northern Ohio. There was nothing like getting on a combine with the Zwyers beaming ear to ear. I had some of those experiences. 
   He inherited so much of his spunk from his father, and he was also political. Howard was a Township Trustee from 1972 to 1979 and sought public office because he thought there needed to be changes for the better. Without complaint, he accepted constituents' phone calls of praise or blame and made sure the telephone was at the dinner table so he could answer. 
   And during late night snowstorms, he helped plow the roads. He really was a builder of our community. Throughout his public service, he attended most trustees meetings and recruited others to run for township office. His daughter said he was a little sad about how Monclova had evolved into more of a suburban community, but he understood how progress may change life as we have known it. 
   In retirement, Mr. Zwyer made bluebird houses, which he installed and tended, lots of bluebird houses. The family joked about how he could do anything if he had a roll of duct tape, a Snickers bar and a can of WD-40. And that is so true. 
   He loved adventures with his grandchildren, and he gave out cards that gave you hugs and kisses, and he handed out lots of tulips. 
   He was a member of St. Joseph's Church, Maumee, and became an usher until he became ill about 6 years ago. 
   He was a 1941 graduate of former Monclova High School, and his beloved wife, Eleanor, survives him. They have been married since 1945. They have a daughter, Jeanne Counts; a brother, Bob Zwyer; and two grandsons. 
   It is such a joy to be able to talk about the life of this wonderful, wonderful Ohioan who did so much to create a culture of caring and of fatherliness across our region and who helped make agriculture in Ohio, our leading industry, what it is today. 
   We shall truly miss Howard Zwyer and all of the values that he represented. We know that he, his brother Ray, their father, are in a very, very special place in the city beyond the stars. We shall miss them. We wish their families Godspeed. Our thoughts are with them particularly at this difficult time.  
   Howard John Zwyer 
   Howard John Zwyer, 83, of Monclova, passed away Friday, January 5, 2007, at the Hospice of Northwest Ohio in Perrysburg. Howard was born May 13, 1923, in Monclova, the son of John and Sophie Grossheim Zwyer. He graduated from Monclova High. School in 1941. Howard was a farmer and gardener his entire life, never living more than one mile from his original home. He loved sharing his raspberries, blackberries and other produce from his garden with neighbors and friends. Howard was a lifelong member of St. Joseph Catholic Church and ushered for many years. He served as a Monclova Township Trustee for eight years and after his service, he stayed active in the township and politics. He was a member of the Monclova Democrat Club, Lucas County Farm Bureau, the Maumee Eagles and the Lucas County Soil and Water Conservation District. Howard loved his family, International tractors, duct tape, WD-40, Snickers bars, adventures with his grandsons, hugs, Tulips, bluebirds and smiles. 
   He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Eleanor; daughter, Jeanne (Jim) Counts; grandsons, Buck (Heather) Counts and Will Counts; brother, Bob (Eleanor) sister-in-law, Thelma Zwyer and many special nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents; son, Jimmy; a daughter, Julie; brother and sister-in law, Paul and Geneva; brother, Raymond, and sister and brother-in-law, Helen and Gilbert Sattler.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MOURNING AND HONORING DETECTIVE KEITH DRESSEL -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened to stand before our House today to announce the tragic death of Detective Keith Dressel of the Toledo Police Department and offer deepest condolences on behalf of our entire community to his wife, Danielle, and their children. 
   Detective Dressel, who was only 35 years old, was fatally shot on the morning of Wednesday, February 21, while on routine patrol in North Toledo, the first Toledo police officer to lose his life in service to our community since 1970. 
   In reality, though, there is nothing routine or common about Detective Dressel's extraordinary service or that of the men and women with whom he served. Every day Detective Dressel sacrificed his safety so that he might protect all of ours. 
   As a member of the vice squad, Detective Dressel engaged in dangerous work that frequently placed him in high-risk environments. He did this not for glory or praise, but to serve and protect residents from all walks of life. 
   Charlotte Bronte's poem ``Life'' teaches us: 
  ``What though Death at times steps in And calls our Best away? What though sorrow seems to win, O'er hope, a heavy sway? Yet hope again elastic springs, unconquered, though she fell; Still buoyant are her golden wings, Still strong to bear us well. Manfully, fearlessly, The day of trial bear, For gloriously, victoriously Can courage quell despair!''  
   On the fateful day when lives were changed forever, the painful call went out: ``Attention all units. Detective Keith Dressel has answered his final call.'' 
   The Toledo Blade newspaper reports today: ``The final radio call to the slain Toledo police vice detective, a taped broadcast played at the conclusion of his funeral Mass yesterday, broke somber faces into tears.'' 
   The impact of this terrible tragedy has touched every corner of our community and beyond. We have all been moved by Keith Dressel's sacrifice, commitment, and courage, as well as that of his family. 
   On behalf of the citizens of Toledo, Ohio, and all of the lives Detective Dressel has touched, I offer our deepest sympathy to Detective Dressel's loved ones, colleagues, and friends. May their faith sustain them through the difficult journey ahead as they remember the words of Psalm 46, versus 1 and 2: ``God is our refuge and our strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.'' May their strength as a family and their memories of their husband, father, brother, nephew, uncle, grandson, son, and friend sustain them as they mourn his loss and celebrate his selfless legacy of patriotism, purpose, and service to his fellow citizens. His children should be comforted by the knowledge that life is not measured in years but in deeds. 
   Detective Keith Dressel lived as a man for others, despite the danger and sacrifice to his own. May he rest in peace in God's house as an archangel watching over and guiding our earthly pursuits.  
   The Blade describes this hero's funeral: ``Two lines of officers--at least two people deep--wove through the parking lot. Three to four other lines of officers stood at the front doors of the church, including Toledo police Chief Mike Navarre and Toledo fire Chief Mike Bell. 
   ``After a private ceremony for the family, Detective Dressel's flag-draped casket was escorted from the funeral home to a white hearse with a small American flag on the driver's side door. White-gloved Toledo police honor guard members stood on both sides of the hearse. Three rows of Cleveland Police Pipes and Drums members in full garb played and led the slow procession to the church. Officers lining the way saluted as the hearse passed. 
   ``At the church, pallbearers in dark suits slowly pulled the casket from the hearse. The casket was blessed with Holy Water before being wheeled into the sanctuary. Inside, the U.S. flag covering the casket was removed and replaced with a white pall..... More than 2,000 people filled Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in Temperance for a funeral Mass for the 35-year-old husband and father of two. Detective Dressel's wife, Danielle, 32, held the couple's 4-year-old son, Noah, as the family was escorted inside the church. 
   The Mass ended with Detective Dressel's last call, bagpipes, a prayer, and a hymn. 
   Law enforcement officers streamed out of the church and formed more than a dozen rows in front of the front doors. Music from bagpipes and drums filled the background. The officers saluted as the casket was placed inside the hearse. 
   The procession from the church to St. Anthony's Cemetery involved more than 1,500 police cars and other vehicles from dozens of states. Dozens of firefighters from the Toledo Fire Department and other area communities stood single file along the west side of Jackman Road leading to two fire aerial trucks forming an arch at Jackman and Temperance Road. The firefighters saluted the passing hearse and procession. The extended aerial ladders held an American flag, which blew south to north in the wind. The Toledo police mounted patrol unit joined the solemn procession, including for a time a riderless horse with boots backward in the stirrups, and led it to the cemetery. 
   Along the way, residents stood at the ends of their driveways and schoolchildren stood with their hands over their hearts. Across the road from the cemetery, citizen mourners and officers stood silently in the cold, sometimes biting breeze, for the hearse and the clip-clop of the horses. Mrs. Dressel acknowledged those standing along the side of the road 
   The start of the graveside ceremony was delayed to allow mourners--many of them law enforcement officers--to park and walk more than a mile to the small, fenced cemetery for a final tribute to the fallen hero. A shorter service included The Lord's Prayer, which many officers said aloud. The American flag on Detective Dressel's casket was folded into a triangle and given to his widow. 
   Seven officers fired a three-volley shotgun salute as officers snapped their own salute. 
   ``Taps'' echoed through the air. ``Amazing Grace'' was played on the bagpipes as snowflakes slowly fell from the sky. 
   As the Dressel family shared a last, private moment near the detective's casket, red-cheeked officers sniffled as they filed out of the cemetery. 
   Detective Dressel was hired by the Toledo Police Department in 1993. Held in high esteem by his colleagues, this fallen hero will be remembered as a devoted public servant who was committed to his work and to his family. Despite his challenging work, Detective Dressel never compromised his integrity or sacrificed his sense of humor. Evidence of his legacy is clear in the heartfelt eulogies: 
   Officiating at the Mass, his priest, Father Nusbaum said, ``Before Keith's laughter will fade away from this Earth, we'll hear it in a blink of an eye. That wonderful laugh.'' 
   His police chief Michael Navarre said, ``We honor a true hero, a young man who dedicated his life to this community...... ``I salute you [Keith]. We all salute you and a life well lived.'' 
   It is reported that ``Ken Dressel, Detective Dressel's uncle, said one of the happiest days of his nephew's life was when he was accepted into the police academy. Only second to his family, the slain detective was most proud of his badge. `As much of a cop as he was--doing some of the most dangerous work in Toledo--we would often see him sitting on the floor playing with the children at family gatherings.' '' 
   The impact of this terrible tragedy has touched every comer of our community and beyond. We have all been moved by Keith Dressel's sacrifice, commitment, and courage as well as that of his family's. 
   We recall in excerpt the lines of Longfellow's poem, What the heart of the young man said to the psalmist. 
  Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul. 
 Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrow Find us farther than to-day. 
 Art is long, and Time is fleeting, And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still, like muffled drums, are beating Funeral marches to the grave. 
 In the world's broad field of battle, In the bivouac of Life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife! 
 Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,--act in the living Present! Heart within, and God o'erhead! 
 Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time; 
 Footprints, that perhaps another, Sailing o'er life's solemn main, A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, Seeing, shall take heart again. 
 Let us, then, be up and doing, With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labor and to wait.   
   On behalf of the citizens of Toledo, Ohio, and of all the lives Detective Dressel has touched, I offer my deepest condolences to Detective Dressel's loved ones, colleagues and friends. Without a doubt, our community is better because he served. Detective Dressel will not be forgotten. May their faith sustain them through the difficult journey ahead as they remember the words of Psalm 46, verses 1-2: ``God is our refuge and our strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.'' May their strength as a family and their memories of their husband, father, brother, nephew, uncle, grandson, son and friend sustain them as they mourn his loss and celebrate his legacy.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (WELCOMING THE HONORABLE MARCIA FUDGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- (House of Representatives - November 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, obviously this is a great moment of joy for our country and for our delegation. Congresswoman Marcia Fudge will become an outstanding Member of this House. She is an attorney, a businesswoman, and a mayor--indeed, the first female mayor, and first African American mayor of Warrensville, Ohio--since the year 2000. That alone constitutes major accomplishments. 
   She has her law degree from Cleveland State University, and she will become the ninth female Member ever elected to this Chamber from the great State of Ohio, and only the second African American woman ever to be elected from our State. 
   As Mayor of Warrensville, Ohio, she has been heavily involved in economic development. In fact, she said, ``I believe people started to feel really good about where they lived because of the results of our economic development efforts, and I think when people feel good about where they live, that pride transitions into so many positive things.'' 
   Congresswoman Fudge formerly served our beloved colleague Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones as her Chief of Staff during her early years. She also worked early in her career on Carl Stokes' Cleveland bid for mayor, as a teenager, heading up Young Folks for Stokes. 
   She has been a law clerk; a tax attorney; county prosecutor's office attorney; held Cuyahoga County Budget, Tax, and Finance positions; and she is Immediate Past President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, serving from 1996 to 2000. We know what a powerhouse that is. 
   She's also a board member of the famous Cleveland Public Library and, perhaps most important of all, she's a member of the Baptist Glenville Church of God. We know she's come this far by faith. 
   We welcome her here today and join her among our Buckeye ranks. 
   I would be pleased to yield to the fine dean of our delegation from the Republican side of the aisle, Congressman Ralph Regula, who we will say goodbye to as a Member this year, but not as a former Member, and we expect to see him and his beautiful wife, Mary, very often.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Green and express gratitude to Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Subcommittee Chair Watt and Congressman Miller for their extraordinary efforts to restore confidence in our Nation's housing markets and address the housing mortgage crisis facing our Nation, this crisis has been felt no more harshly than in the State of Ohio, one of the hardest hit States in our Union, where our foreclosure filing rates have gone up 300 percent since just last year, thousands upon thousands of Ohioans having for sale and foreclosure signs in front of their homes. In Ohio, $20 billion and growing is the gap, the financing gap. 
   I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment, but want to clarify that under the bill, any legal case that has been filed can proceed forward, indeed until the regulations for implementation of the bill are completed after it is signed by the President. States are not limited in their ability to prosecute in cases of fraud, collusion, misrepresentation, deception, false advertising or civil rights. Importantly, any mortgage made in the future will have to assure the borrower's ability to repay and that the borrower be yielded a net tangible benefit. 
   As this bill moves forward, I believe it can be perfected even more to restore confidence, discipline and provide accountability in our troubled, very troubled, housing markets, which are helping to drive our Nation into recession. 
   I just want to say to Chairman Frank, you are the right man in the right place at the right time. I just hope that the other body and the President of the United States follow your leadership on this really critical issue, take it not just to Ohio, but to our country. 
   Stockton, Detroit, Riverside-San Bernardino Post Top Metro Foreclosure Rates in Q3  
   IRVINE, Calif.--Nov. 14, 2007--RealtyTrac  (realtytrac.com), the leading online marketplace for foreclosure properties, today released its Q3 2007 Metropolitan Foreclosure Market Report, which shows Stockton, Calif., Detroit and Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., documented the three highest foreclosure rates among the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas during the third quarter. 
   RealtyTrac publishes the largest and most comprehensive national database of foreclosure and bank-owned properties, with over 1 million properties from nearly 2,500 counties across the country, and is the foreclosure data provider to MSN Real Estate, Yahoo! Real Estate and The Wall Street Journal's Real Estate Journal. 
   ``Although cities in just three states--California, Ohio and Florida--accounted for more than two-thirds of the top 25 metro foreclosure rates, increasing foreclosure activity was not limited to just a few hot spots,'' said James J. Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac. ``In fact, 77 out of the top 100 metro areas reported more foreclosure filings in the third quarter than they had in the previous quarter. Still, there continue to be pockets of the country--most noticeably metro areas in the Carolinas, Virginia and Texas--that have thus far dodged the foreclosure bullet.'' 
   CALIFORNIA, OHIO, FLORIDA CITIES DOMINATE TOP METRO FORECLOSURE RATES
   Stockton, Calif., documented one foreclosure filing for every 31 households during the quarter, the highest foreclosure rate along the nation's 100 largest metro areas. A total of 7,116 foreclosure filings on 4,409 properties were reported in the metro area during the quarter, up more than 30 percent from the previous quarter. 
   Detroit's third-quarter foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for every 33 households ranked second highest among the nation's 100 largest metro areas. A total of 25,708 foreclosure filings on 16,079 properties were reported in the metro area during the quarter, more than twice the number of filings in the previous quarter. 
   The Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., metropolitan area in Southern California documented the nation's third highest metro foreclosure rate, one foreclosure filing for every 43 households. A total of 31,661 foreclosure filings 20,664 properties were reported in the metro area during the quarter, up more than 30 percent from the previous month. 
   Other cities in the top 10 metro foreclosure rates: Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Las Vegas; Sacramento, Calif.; Cleveland; Miami; Bakersfield, Calif.; and Oakland, Calif. California cities accounted for seven of the top 25 metro foreclosure rates, while Florida and Ohio each accounted for five of the top 25 spots. 
   RIVERSIDE-SAN BERNARDINO, LOS ANGELES, DETROIT REPORT MOST FORECLOSURE FILINGS
   The Riverside-San Bernardino metropolitan area reported the most foreclosure filings during the quarter, followed by Los Angeles, with 29,501 filings on 18,043 properties. The Los Angeles foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for every 113 households ranked No. 26 among the nation's 100 largest metro areas. Detroit reported the third highest number of foreclosure filings during the quarter. 
   Atlanta's foreclosure filing total of 21,695 on 18,940 properties was the fourth highest foreclosure filing total, and the metro area's foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for every 92 households ranked No. 18 among the top 100 metro areas. 
   Other cities with foreclosure filing totals among the 10 highest were Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Cleveland, Chicago, Miami and Sacramento, Calif.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I can say that Congresswoman Millender-McDonald would be so happy to see Congresswoman Yvette Clarke in the  chair tonight. And I thank Congresswoman Diane Watson for her compassionate service and certainly for this memorial service tonight. And I extend deepest condolences on behalf of the people of Ohio to the family of our beloved Congresswoman, Juanita Millender-McDonald, her husband, Jim, her children, her grandchildren. 
   Having had the great pleasure of serving with her during her entire tenure, let me say, when I think of Juanita, I think of a woman who was resilient, who was strong, determined, refined, accomplished, persevering and, indeed, courageous, a pioneer with a great sense of humor and, as a minister's daughter, a boundless sense of hope. 
   Even today, for a woman to chair a full committee of this House is a rarity. And for an African-American woman, she created the mold, the first African-American woman in the history of this country to chair a full committee in this House. 
   Just a few weeks ago, a new volume of ``Women of Congress'' was published, and hers is the first name in that volume, commissioned by order of the Chair of the House Administration Committee, Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   There are some people who teach us how to live and indeed, she did. And many people can teach us how to die, and she has done that with her great dignity and her courage. 
   Just a few weeks ago, when Nancy Pelosi of California was sworn in as our first Speaker, I had the great honor of being one of the two Democratic tellers. Juanita, as Chair of the House Administration Committee, sat to my right. I shall never forget that moment, and I think she lived partly for that moment. 
   May her strength comfort her family in these trying moments of bereavement. I believe God holds close those who journey toward the light in this Easter and Passover season. And may the angels of mercy lift her and lift the spirits of those who love her and bring comfort and bring peace.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from the great State of Michigan, the chairman of the committee, for yielding. 
   Unfortunately, I have to disagree with him on this bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1908 because we don't want to weaken the U.S. patent system. This is surely not the time with a trillion-dollar trade deficit to do more selling out of America and to try to harmonize our standards down to some of the worst intellectual property pirates like China. 
   This bill essentially makes it easier for infringers to steal U.S. inventions, and it is truly sad that we are only given a few seconds to talk about this. That alone should tell our colleagues, vote ``no,'' give us a chance to open this up and talk about how this is going to affect jobs in America. 
   This bill affects two-thirds to 80 percent of the asset value of all U.S. firms. Most industrial companies in this country oppose it. Over 200 organizations across this country oppose it, including the electronics industry, pharmaceuticals, small inventors, and universities. And, yet, we just get a few seconds here. 
   Let me tell you what is going on. Mr. Emanuel was down here earlier reading a list of the big semiconductor companies, the high-tech firms. This bill does heavily benefit them because they are some of the worst intellectual property infringers. 
   What this bill does is it supports those large transnational corporations that repeatedly infringe on the patents of others, and they are looking to reduce what they have to pay in the courts. Now, they have had to pay about $3.5 billion in fines over the last couple of years, and it was deserved. But that represents less than 1 percent of their revenues. What they are trying to do is use this bill to make it harder for small inventors and others to file. 
   What does this bill change? It says to an inventor, unlike since 1709 in this country, when we say if you are first to invent, that patent belongs to us, they want to change it to first-to-file. In other words, they can file it anywhere else in the world and someone else can take that and infringe on that invention. It is not first-invention anymore, it is first-to-file. Boy, there is a lot more to say and our time should not be squashed in this House on an issue of such vital importance to the industrial and the commercial base of this country.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman kindly for yielding me this time.  
   On the manager's amendment, you know what's really sad about this bill is that it is very complicated, and it's a work in progress as we sit here on the floor. It's too important for America and for the future of our industrial and economic base to be treated this way, and I know that the Chair of the subcommittee and the full committee are listening as I speak today. We shouldn't be drafting this in a manager's amendment on the floor. 
   There's been some inference that the AFL-CIO supports this bill. The AFL-CIO does not support this bill. They support the fact that it is being improved but they do not support the bill. 
   In addition to that, there's something very important I was not able to address earlier, and that is that this bill prematurely reveals inventors' secrets. In 1999, the Patent Act required the Patent Office to publish on the Internet a patent application 18 months from the date of filing, but the act also allowed inventors to opt out from that if they agreed not to file for patent in another nation. That's the so-called opt-out provision. 
   Now, between 20 and 33 percent of U.S.-origin patents opt out of the system. They're small people. They're trying to get the venture capital to start up their company and so forth, and the average time the Patent Office takes to process a patent is 31 months. Thus, all the secrets in all patent applications will be made available to every pirate in the world for more than a year before a small inventor, any inventor has a chance for patent protection. 
   Now, we're going to be told, well, Mr. Issa's amendment will fix this. No, it will not, and we will argue against that a little bit more down the road. 
   Several speakers this morning, Mr. Welch of Vermont and Mr. Johnson of Georgia, said, well, we need this reform because we haven't had patent reform since 1952. That's not true. There have been 17 amendments in major bills before this Congress that deal with patent reform in the last 15 years. 
   The problem with this bill is that it tries to harmonize to lower standards in the world rather than cause other countries to harmonize up to our standards. It takes away the right of first to invent, and it transfers it to first to file. That means an inventor who come here to the Patent Office here in the United States, no matter how small, and file a patent and got the right as an inventor first to invent could be superseded in the international market by someone who happened to catch that invention on the Internet or elsewhere and file it in China first. So it changes it from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system. This is a substantial change from the system that has been in place in this country since the early 1700s. 
   You know what I said earlier what's going on here is the big proponents of this, the semiconductor companies, and Mr. Emanuel read some of their names, have been fined substantially for patent infringement over the last several years, about $3.5 billion, and they're trying to get the law changed to make it easier for them. You know what, they have a right to exist. They have a right to function. The problem is they have been taken to court, and there are 15 standards the courts use to ascertain damages. They want to reduce it to one and make the 14 optional. You know what, the Federal judges are saying don't do that; we like the current system. It gives the courts the flexibility that they use. 
   Why should a few transnational corporations, sort of the big tech companies, have this much power in this Congress? Why don't we have the right of others to be heard here fully rather than having to condense such a serious debate into a few seconds here on the floor? 
   Why am I opposed to this bill? I'm opposed to this bill because it gives too much power to the big tech transnationals, and it takes away power from the universities that are opposed to this; although, some in California, where so many of these big tech companies are located, are happy. But come to Ohio, come to Wisconsin, come to New York. There are lots of universities that are opposed to this. So it's giving too much advantage to a few companies. 
   In addition to that, it totally turns upside down the first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system, and it would permit lots of infringements internationally. 
   It does eliminate the opt-out provision where, if a small inventor doesn't want their invention put up on the Internet, it takes away the opt-out provision from them. Mr. Issa's amendment does not fix it. We want an opportunity to fix that, because we want to protect the third of inventors that do not file internationally, that do not want their patents put out there like that, and they are not the big companies. They're the smaller companies. And why force them to go into court? They don't have the money to defend themselves anyway. 
   There's broad-based opposition to this bill. There are lots of organizations, including the Institute of Electronic Engineers, Medical College of Wisconsin. There are many, many others, Cornell University, all opposed to this. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and allowing me to broaden the record here in the very few short seconds we have been allowed.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I just want to place on the record that Issa's amendment, Issa's choice, is would you rather have the inventor shot with a pistol or a rifle? In either case, he or she ends up dead. 
   Now, why is that? Because the 1999 Patent Act required the Patent Office to publish on the Internet a patent application 18 months from the date of filing. But the issue really is, it takes an average of 31 months for patent review. Mr. Issa, I think, brings it up to 24 months. Thus, what happens is there's a gap between when it's filed and when it's approved, and you have to go up on the Internet. Under current law, you can opt out of that so you can protect your invention and not have some pirate in China or Japan or somewhere else take it from you. That is not in this bill. 
   The elimination of the opt-out provision is a terrible, terrible omission and a major change from existing law, and the Issa amendment does not make it better.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I would like to defend your labor credentials. You voted against NAFTA on this floor. You were a leader on your side of the aisle. That vote was proven to be right. 
   What this is going to do, this is going to ``NAFTAtize'' the patent system and allow China to infringe on more of our inventions. We should not permit this to happen. We should be allowed to fully debate this for the people of this country. 
   Two-thirds of the value of companies, up to 80 percent of our industrial companies value, relate to their patents, and we should be given more respect. We should give our constituents more respect than compressing this debate into such a narrow time slot.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to place on the record opposition to Mr. Issa's amendment to try to politicize decision making that is done by professionals over at the Patent Office. But in doing so, also to place on the record who's financing the expensive lobbying campaign on behalf of the bill that is before us today. They are a coalition of companies including transnational corporations: Adobe, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, eBay, Lenovo, Dell and Oracle.     
   During the period of 1993-2005, four of them alone paid out more than $3.5 billion in patent settlements. And in the same period, their combined revenues were over $1.4 trillion, making their patent settlements only about one-quarter of 1 percent of those revenues. Now they wish to reduce even those costs, not by changing their obviously unfair and often illegal business practices, but by persuading Congress and also the Supreme Court to weaken U.S. patent protections. 
   We ought to stand up for American inventors. We should not allow this bill to go forward. It should have sunlight. I know my colleagues are doing the best they can, but they can surely do better than this.

   As I said with Issa's choice, it is either being shot with a pistol or a rifle.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   I wanted to point out that in every year when patents are granted the very small number of lawsuits that are generated as a result of that. For example, in the year 2006, there were 183,000 patents granted; 1.47 percent actually ended up in some type of lawsuit, and most of those lawsuits were settled before trial. 
   The current system is working very well for the majority of inventors as lawsuits have represented that smaller percentage going back as far as the eye can see. 
   I would like to place on the Record those facts that, in fact, lawsuits are a minuscule percent of all patents reviewed and granted. And I would also like to place on the Record from the United States Court of Appeals the following letter from the chief judge who states that the present bill creates a new type of macroeconomic analysis that would be extremely costly and time consuming, far more so than current application of the well-settled apportionment law.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke says Congress should do more to address the housing foreclosure crisis. I agree. 
   However, let me respectfully suggest to the Fed Chairman that he, too, can do much more to help. Let him use his considerable power to bring to the table the very big banks that aren't coming to do foreclosure workouts at the local level. They just happen to be the firms the Fed has been rewarding handsomely by injecting billions and billions of dollars to rescue them. You know the names: Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia. 
   Firms like Countrywide don't even show up when borrowers at the local level try to renegotiate their loans. Yet, the Federal Reserve has been rewarding them by putting them on their list of select primary dealers. Fancy that. 
   So, Mr. Bernanke, let me help you out. Here's a list of the firms you can invite right now. They're not responding to Ohioans witnessing foreclosure: Countrywide, Chase Mortgage, Citifinancial, GMAC, HSBC, Sovereign Bank, Indy Mac Bank, Popular Mortgage, Nova Star, Saxon Mortgage Services, Option One Mortgage, EMC Mortgage, ASC Servicing, HomeEq, Wilshire, Nationstar, Equifirst, Litton Loan, Flagstar. 
   Let's be honest. These mega firms are holding the levers of power over our homeowners. It's time the scales of justice had balance restored on behalf of our people.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE COST OF CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, what must our children think when they hear news reports about the upcoming Presidential race of 2008, and when they hear over and over and over again how much money all the candidates are raising, $27 million, $20 million, $18 million, and the ante is being raised every week. 
   In just 6 months of campaigning, the 2008 Presidential candidates have already amassed more than $265 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, some analysts predict that the eventual nominees will need to raise a half a billion dollars apiece in order to compete, a half a billion dollars apiece. 
   In the last 2004 Presidential election, the candidates, together, raised $880,500,000. The 2008 Presidential election will see the first billion-dollar race in American history. That's more than the gross domestic product of 25 nations. 
   What must our children think about this out-of-control arms race? Don't they conclude only the rich have a chance, that the rich control, that to get ahead, you have to court the rich? What must our children think of our Nation, once founded with the high ideals of patriotism, sacrifice and rebellion against the entrenched view that has now fallen so sick, so sick. A majority of its candidates in both parties run to Wall Street and hedge funds and mega-buck donors and bundlers whose real motives often come to light as scandals. 
   Former Member Shirley Chisholm described herself as unbought and unbossed. Those of us who knew her knew she wasn't kidding when she said that. 
   It's hard to imagine a Presidential candidate staying unbought under such immense pressure to raise money. Inevitably, those candidates have to turn to the superrich or to bundlers, to special interests and unsavory characters who care only about themselves and their special interests and very little about our country. 
   When we start looking under the rocks, it's hard to say what we will find: foreign influence in unregulated hedge funds, foreign contributions laundered through third parties, cronyism taken to the nth degree. 
   Almost 100 years ago, a native son of Ohio, Warren Harding, won the White House. He ushered in a level of corruption that was unrivaled at that time. The dollar amounts being tossed around in the 2000 Presidential race make it only a matter of time before another giant scandal rocks our government and further undermines the confidence of our body politic and our very system of government. We all know what's going on is wrong, wrong, wrong. 
   When I am asked who I am supporting for President, I say the one who has raised the least money. 
   We should be asking ourselves what must our children think, before it's too late. We can act now to curb this out-of-control arms race. I have introduced a bill, H. Con. Res. 6, that reaffirms that the presence of unlimited amounts of money corrupts the political process in a fundamental manner. 
   If money equals free speech, then lack of money equals lack of free speech. The bill expresses the need to preserve, through our Constitution, the integrity of a republican form of government, restore public confidence in election campaigns, and ensure all citizens an equal opportunity to participate in our political process. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation and for Americans to pay attention and call this important issue to the attention of their Representatives. 
   America needs a new revolution to take our politics back from the money handlers and telemarketers. Let's return our Republic to the American people and, importantly, a free Republic to our children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Andean Trade Agreement, H.R. 1830, which, strangely, will be brought up under suspension, which means no debate and no amendment. I thought voters put new Democratic leadership in charge of this House to stop deals such as this being done in this way. 
   H.R. 1830 would extend special duty treatment to certain imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru until September 30 of 2009. The Andean Accord was originally intended to promote economic growth and replace production of illegal drugs in the Andean region. But in 2006, the United States had already racked up $10 billion more in deficit with these countries, and the last time I looked, that cocaine was still coming over our borders from Colombia. 
   Mr. Speaker, this deal made on the NAFTA model is a failed model. Not a single other trade deal under the NAFTA model has created good or better jobs. Because it is based on the NAFTA model, the specific provisions are just tinkering at the edges. 
   This bill will cost more American jobs, period. How many copies of the NAFTA deal must enter this Congress before we finally say no? 
   We don't need more Bill Thomas and Tom DeLay-type trade agreements being rushed through this House. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on 1830. 
   Let's have a full debate on trade. The American people demand it of us.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's yielding me the time even though I rise in opposition to this bill and to any bill that will continue to outsource more U.S. jobs, increase our trade deficit, and not stop the import of illegal narcotics into this country. 
   This is another one of those bills cast in NAFTA model that is already yielding over $10 billion a year in trade deficits to this country by the outsourcing of our jobs. Why would we want to do more? 
   The American people elected us to make a difference. They are expecting us to be different than the Thomas committee. Why are we delivering the same kind of bills to this floor? 
   Procedurally, this bill is being brought up overnight without Members even having the opportunity to read a text. I don't know who made that decision. I doubt it was anyone on this floor. But for people who represent districts like ours, it is truly a tragedy. 
   One fact we are certain of is that NAFTA-type agreements have cost more jobs, more job losses, more trade deficit every time one of these bills comes to the floor. When are we going to learn? 
   The idea of the Andean agreement was that it would help to displace coca production with other economic enterprises, and yet we see coca production increasing and more of those illegal drugs coming over our border. When something isn't working, you ought to fix it. 
   We look at the provisions dealing with labor enforcement. There is no enforcement, especially in the farm-related positions, in the flour industry, in the asparagus industry, and so forth. There is no enforcement in those countries. Why would we do this? 
   I would love to be a Member of this Congress when a trade agreement is advanced that creates jobs in the United States of America, which is our first responsibility, rather than outsourcing; that yields trade surpluses, not growing deficits that are such a huge drag on this economy, now knocking two points off GDP every year; and that treats the Members of this institution with respect, with respect. Not excluding those who disagree, but putting us around the table, letting our voices be heard, letting us be constructive Members of this institution.     
   I would say to the leadership of this institution, treat the Members with respect. We were also elected. 
   I thank the gentleman for allowing me this time to speak in opposition.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (A RED HERRING -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the New York Times CBS spring poll has reported that 68 percent of Americans favor putting restrictions on what is called free trade to protect our domestic industries. That is the highest level of concern since the poll began asking the question in the 1980s, and a 12 percent rise just since 2000. 
   Only 14 percent of Americans surveyed last year by the Pew Global Attitudes Project said increase in trade was very good for our country. And the American people, by a healthy majority, view NAFTA and NAFTA-like trade agreements as flawed and costing our people more job washout every day. In other words, a majority of people in our country not only believe something is wrong with current U.S. trade policy, enough of them have now been hurt directly by unfair trade that they now know personally what a bad trade deal can yield. When you are almost $1 trillion in trade deficit, something is fundamentally wrong. 
   So what does one of America's premier newspapers place on its editorial page this week in response? Do they look inside the gaping job loss and trade deficits our Nation is experiencing and attempt to reshape the policy to again produce a better yield in jobs for our people and Nation? No. They put their head in the sand. And they do so in the form of an editorial that is nothing more than a red herring. Actually, this looks like a herring to me. A red herring. You've heard that old expression which means someone distracts attention from the real issue. They state a half-truth and then wage a fierce argument against that falsehood as if the falsehood were true. It is an old trick. 
   The New York Times article written by Eduardo Porter, is a complete red herring. He said that people who worry about job loss in America related to trade want to stop trade. He said that those people are isolationists. Nothing could be more untrue. 
   I say to Mr. Porter the vast majority of the American people want to fix what is wrong with these trade deals. And there is plenty wrong. If he fails to grasp that, he might, as the old expression goes, ``fail to see the wall in front of his face and run right into it.'' Mr. Porter alleges that the majority of Americans who favor putting restrictions on free trade to protect domestic industries will push the new President to be undiplomatic and unreasonable when it comes to what Porter calls economic protectionism. 
   Mr. Porter, reciprocity is not protectionism. With nearly $1 trillion net trade deficit sucking more and more jobs out of this country, he should be championing balancing our trade agreement and creating jobs here in America again. But he opines that other countries, like Canada, Sweden and Germany, in which fewer people favor such measures, are scared that a new trade model would bring about what he calls a trade war. Yeah, you scare them, right? Try to scare the American people. 
   What Mr. Porter does not understand is that America's hostility is not to international trade, but to trade agreements and deficits that cause job outsourcing, job losses and cuts to middle-class benefits and health coverage. Americans support trade that wins for them and that brings prosperity to America again. They want trade that builds a middle class here at home and abroad. They are tired of being jerked around by the multinational companies that trade them for $1 an hour worker in China who has no hope of a better life. They want that worker to get a fair deal too. They support trade that creates jobs, America used to do that before we fell into deficit, and exports American products again to customers around the world. They broadly oppose the failed NAFTA model that has sucked jobs and money away from America to corrupt and closed markets that keep their boot on the necks of workers around the world who have no rights. Porter claims trade hawks want to disengage from the world. Wrong again. Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans wants to engage. They want reciprocal trade, balanced trade and free trade that builds a middle class, not shatters it. 
   That is why a number of us introduced a bill he mentions offhand, the trade act, H.R. 6180 which currently has over 50 sponsors and sets guidelines for responsible trade that encourages free trade among free people. Porter says that Europe and Germany don't share our point of view and we should be more like them. I will agree with him on one account. We should be more like them because they have trade balances, not trade deficits. They are sitting pretty compared to ours. We have a $711.6 trade deficit in 2007, and they, in fact, have surpluses. So Mr. Porter ought to be fighting for a strong America. And that means free trade among free people.  
   Indeed, the latest monthly trade figures from April show our nation has just gone further in the hole at $60.9 billion deficit. More red ink = more lost jobs and more workers falling out of the middle class. Yet Canada and Sweden both managed surpluses of about $30 billion in U.S. dollars. Their trade numbers are moving in the right direction. Germany commanded a trade surplus of more than $185 billion. I ask Mr. Porter, why shouldn't America move its accounts to balance and surplus? Why does he favor more job washout? More loss of income for our people? More red ink? Furthermore, workers in those countries need not worry about losing their healthcare since the government provides assistance. Those countries trade in order to make money, but our trade policies have resulted in a hemorrhage of our resources. 
   The New York Times and Mr. Porter ought to be fighting for a strong America--and that  means a strong economy evidenced by balanced trade accounts, not deficits. A strong America means keeping and creating good jobs, with living wages and benefits like healthcare. And a strong America means trade relationships that bring strength to our economy and our trading partners', not a race to the bottom or human rights violations. 
   America ought to be fighting for opening the closed markets of the world, like Japan's and China's, not putting our heads in the sand while our competitors levy non-tariff barriers against America's goods and services. If we are not trading with a free country with a free market and free people, we are not trading freely at all. We are paying these countries to continue unfair economic and political practices at the cost of our own prosperity and standard of living. 
   We ought to be fighting for America's middle class, not outsourcing their jobs to China, India, and Mexico. We should not oppose free trade; we should support free trade among free people.   
   Europe Fears a Post-Bush Unilateralism, This Time on Trade  
   The Democrats' vocal hostility to trade is starting to scare many of America's best friends. As Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have bashed China and a variety of free trade agreements, allies who have been yearning for an end to President Bush's in-your-face unilateralism are worried that a Democratic president may be just as undiplomatic, and unreasonable, when it comes to economic protectionism. 
   ``It is very irresponsible, in my view, to pretend to people that we can disengage from international trade,'' Peter Mandelstam, the European trade commissioner, warned in a May interview with the BBC. 
   It would be a mistake to brush all this off as mere campaign posturing. The United States remains as open to trade as its European allies, and in some areas it has even fewer restrictions. But the question is, for how long? 
   Despite economists' assurances about trade's many benefits, American workers increasingly view globalization as a losing battle against China's cheap labor and a very personal threat to their wages and jobs. According to a poll this spring by The New York Times and CBS News, 68 percent of Americans favor putting restrictions on free trade to protect domestic industries. That is the highest share since they began asking the question in the 1980s, and 12 percentage points more than in 2000. 
   Workers in other rich nations feel less threatened. Only 14 percent of Americans surveyed last year by the Pew Global Attitudes Project said increasing trade was ``very good'' for the country. That's less than half the share in Canada, Germany or Sweden. Even among the French, who tend to see capitalism as gauche and occasionally drive tractors into their local McDonalds, 22 percent said more trade was very good. 
   The issue isn't the amount of trade. European countries actually trade much more than the United States. But their citizens appear to be more comfortable with the idea because their governments provide a stronger safety net to catch workers undercut by foreign competition and redistribute the gains from trade more equitably. 
   In the United States, public spending on social programs, from unemployment insurance to health care, amounts to about 17 percent of the overall economy. This is about half the level in Germany and less than almost every other rich nation. America's meager social safety net and its winner-take-all distribution of riches means workers have less to gain from trade's benefits and more to lose from any disruption. 
   Most economists agree that trade plays a small role in the deteriorating fortunes of less educated American workers. But as their wages have sagged, their pensions have shrunk and their health insurance has disappeared, trade has become the scapegoat. Politicians, especially but not solely from the Democratic Party, have been eager to capitalize on those anxieties. 
   Just this week, Democrats in the House and Senate proposed a bill that would require the president to submit plans to renegotiate all current trade agreements--before Congress considered any pending agreements and before the president negotiated any new ones. In April, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to change the rules guiding approval of free trade agreements to stall the approval of one with Colombia. 
   The United States has an enormous stake in maintaining an open global economy. Trade means export markets for American products, as well as cheap imports for American companies and consumers. Foreign competition helps spur productivity, which has driven the spectacular increase in American living standards since World War II. 
   Before this country stumbles into a trade war, all political leaders would benefit from a careful examination of how other wealthy democracies have found ways to cushion economic blows on the most vulnerable and make trade more palatable to their workers. 
   More generous social policies are a far better choice than protectionism.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (WRONG DIRECTION -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the favorite question of political pollsters of late is the benchmark right direction/wrong direction question: ``Do you think our country is headed in the right direction or the wrong direction?'' 
   This year, most people say ``wrong direction,'' and the reason is because  our jobs are headed in the wrong direction. There is a new report out by AMTAC, the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, that details the extent of the job loss in Ohio, the State I represent, just since 2000. 
   The job washout in Ohio over the past 7 years is the worst since the Great Depression. The damage to Ohio's economy has been concentrated in the manufacturing sector. Our farmers are currently enjoying record high prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, and eggs. 
   But manufacturing is a different story. It is the story of lost strength and of lost independence. It is the story of one of America's largest States teetering on the precipice. And the situation in Michigan is even more dire. 
   Our Nation has lost 3.4 million jobs in manufacturing and another 700,000 in the information sector since the beginning of the Bush administration. In the past 7 years, total nonfarm employment in Ohio has declined by 3.7 percent, a loss of over 209,400 jobs, according to Dr. Charles McMillion, author of the report. In the manufacturing sector, Ohio has lost over 236,000 jobs, most of those good-paying jobs with good benefits. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing employment in Ohio dropped from 1 million jobs at the end of 2000 to 777,200 jobs at the end of 2007. That loss of 236,000 manufacturing jobs represents a 23.3 percent drop in employment. 
   Put another way, almost a quarter of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio have disappeared in the last 7 years. Only three of Ohio's metropolitan areas added jobs over the past 3 years, and none of them even matched the 4.3 percent overall U.S. job growth, which, by the way, is the weakest 7-year period since the mid-1940s demobilization after World War II. 
   Akron has the best recent record in Ohio, adding 4.1 percent to its job base. Then came Cincinnati and Columbus at 2 percent or less. I am going to place in the Record the job casualties in Ohio by metropolitan statistical area, and I would invite all of the candidates running for President to get off of their high horses and all these stage crowd rallies and come to us, to travel with the delegation from Ohio to places like Cleveland, Elyria, and Mentor which have lost over 48,800 manufacturing jobs. Or to Youngstown/Warren that has lost over 14,000; or to Steubenville/Weirton, West Virginia, over 3,800 jobs; or to Sandusky, which I represent, having lost 3,500 manufacturing jobs. 
   There you have it. That's why people in Ohio say the country is headed in the wrong direction. And why is this happening, why has Ohio lost more than a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs? The main reason, according to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of AMTAC, is the Bush administration's failed trade policies, and I might say the prior administration's as well, and the flood of imported products from everywhere in the world: China, Mexico, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The U.S. imported $1.37 trillion in manufactured goods in 2007 alone, and we incurred a trade deficit in manufacturing of half a trillion dollars. This is not the hallmark of a strong economy. This is not characteristic of an independent people. And Communist China accounted for more than 50 percent of that half-trillion-dollar deficit in manufactured goods. 
   According to AMTAC, America can't keep running on its China credit card to buy foreign manufactured goods. We need to make things here. We need to be a production economy, not just a finance economy. We have to restart our manufacturing engine. 
   According to Dr. McMillion, the author of the AMTAC report, the jobs data tell only one important part of Ohio's past-7-year economic story, yet these record job losses bear strong witness to the depressing effects of record trade deficits and the loss of U.S. production that they represent. Another key part of Ohio's past-7-year economic history is the unprecedented level of household and Federal debt that even in Ohio played a vital role in moderating the effects of import competition, outsourcing, and job loss. With the soaring engine of household debt now sputtering and debt service payments rising, strong industrial and trade policies seem urgently needed to halt Ohio's further decline. 
   The candidates coming through Ohio keep wondering: What do Ohioans care about? They care about job creation in the United States of America. They care about exporting goods, not jobs. They care about independence for America and the future of good jobs with good wages.  
   The favorite question of political pollsters is the benchmark right direction/wrong direction question. ``Do you think the country is headed in the right direction or wrong direction.'' 
   This year, most people say ``wrong direction,'' and the reason is because our jobs are headed in the wrong direction. 
   There's a new report out by the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition (AMTAC) that details the extent of the job loss in Ohio since 2000. 
   The job washout in Ohio over the past 7 years is the worst since the Great Depression. 
   The damage to Ohio's economy has been concentrated in the manufacturing sector. Our farmers are currently enjoying record high prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and eggs. 
   But manufacturing is a different story. It's the story of lost strength and the loss of independence. It is the story of one of America's largest states, teetering on the precipice. (And the situation in Michigan is even more dire.) 
   Our Nation has lost 3.4 million jobs in manufacturing and another 700,000 in the information sector since the beginning of the Bush administration. 
   In the past 7 years, total non-farm employment in Ohio has declined by 3.7 percent, a loss of 209,400 jobs, according to Dr. Charles McMillion, author of the report. 
   In the manufacturing sector, Ohio has lost 236,000 jobs--many of them good paying jobs with good benefits. 
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing employment in Ohio dropped from 1.01 million jobs at the end of 2000 to 777,200 at the end of 2007. That loss of 236,000 manufacturing jobs represents a 23.3 percent decline in employment. 
   Put another way, almost a quarter of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio have disappeared in the past seven years. 
   Only three of Ohio's metropolitan areas added jobs over the past 3 years and none of them even matched the 4.3 percent overall U.S. job growth (which, by the way, is the weakest 7-year period since the mid-1940's demobilization from World War II). 
   Akron has the best recent record in Ohio, adding 4.1 percent to its job base. Then came Cincinnati and Columbus (2 percent or less). 
   Here are the job casualties in Ohio by Metropolitan Statistical Area: 
   Cleveland/Elyria/Mentor: 48,800 manufacturing jobs; Cincinnati/Middletown: 27,100 manufacturing jobs; Dayton: 25,100 manufacturing jobs--one of the worst hit cities; Columbus: 24,700 manufacturing jobs; Toledo: 14,100 manufacturing jobs; Youngstown/Warren: 14,000 manufacturing jobs; Canton/Massillon: 13,200 manufacturing jobs; Akron: 10,100 manufacturing jobs; Springfield: 6,000 manufacturing jobs--the hardest hit city in Ohio; Mansfield: 4,300 manufacturing jobs; Lima: 3,900 manufacturing jobs; Steubenville/Weirton, West Virginia: 3,800 manufacturing jobs; and Sandusky: 3,500 manufacturing jobs. 
   There you have it. 
   That's why people in Ohio say the country's headed in the wrong direction. 
   And why is this happening? Why has Ohio lost more than a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs? 
   The main reason, according to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of AMTAC, is the Bush administration's failed trade policies and a flood of imported products from China and other low-wage countries.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite a President that has been unwilling to negotiate in good faith, the Agriculture Committee, on both sides of the aisle, has produced a solid compromise. And for the first time, under Chairman Collin Peterson's leadership, this House has provided authority for the agricultural interests of this country to lead America forward into a new energy age. 
   The committee also has provided $1 billion to secure specialty crop production in America for a change, to try to stunt foreign imports, while also providing critical increases for farmers markets to help empower local family farmers. And while there are some trade provisions that were airdropped into this bill, not by the Agriculture Committee that should have been considered in a different manner, the agriculture provisions of this bill are critical for transforming our economy into the 21st century. 
   In a world of increasing trade deficits and economic instability, the production of food, fiber, forestry and now fuel, are all critical for protecting America's economic independence, and her food security. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson for his incredible leadership. He is the right man at the right place at the right time. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the base bill. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (ECONOMIC PLIGHT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the American people are desperately struggling to understand why our Federal Government is ignoring their economic plight. The average price of gasoline now sits at $3.28 and it is rising. Only a month ago, Americans paid $3.16. A year ago, they paid $2.67. Months away from the peak of the summer driving season, the American people can expect to see this trend get only worse. 
   In 1996, the United States began its plunge into nearly total dependence on imported petroleum. With 10 years of oil deficits continuing to plague our economy, we have spent too much time talking and not enough time acting. Our lack of energy independence translates into a true loss of liberty. 
   Since the Bush administration assumed office, our Nation is importing a billion more barrels of petroleum a year. A billion barrels more. By 2007, the trade deficit of oil imports had risen to $293 billion, accounting for a third, over a third, of the total $815 billion U.S. trade deficit. 
   This last statistic is truly sobering. But for this year of 2008, 51 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit, over half, is now the result of imported oil. Over half of our structural trade deficit flows directly from the increasing cost of oil. 
   Again, this equals dependence for America, not independence. It is an abrogation of our birthright as a Nation to allow us to continue in this position. 
   Based on 2007 numbers, the United States is adding $808 million a day to the trade deficit just from our imbalance in oil. The rising cost of oil added an estimated $50 billion to the Nation's trade deficit in 2006 and, on top of that, another $28 billion in 2007.  
   Our country imported 4.8 billion barrels of oil in total energy-related products in 2007 valued at $319 billion. Imagine if we would have been able to spend those dollars here at home what an injection that would be into this economy with the value of the dollar falling, so much related to imports, the economy tanking, the housing market in freefall and Americans feeling the true pinch of all of this. Our government here in Washington has not provided the leadership needed to end this plunge into national subservience. 
   The solution is clear: energy independence now. First, we have to look to our natural resources and pass a good farm bill to unleash the power of the earth and nature as a key part of the solution. And while there has been plenty of talk from our President about energy independence, the insistence on vetoing a bill, that does not live within artificial budget limits that he has declared, is an absurdity that threatens to destroy our progress. A good farm bill invests in rural America, providing an investment in infrastructure and research, including the energy technologies of tomorrow. 
   Second, we must continue to rely on the advanced research technology organized by the National Renewable Energy Lab and give this lab the resources to define and help redefine our new energy future. We need no less a commitment than we envisioned when we created NASA and space exploration. With that came security, and now we need energy security. It is that high a priority. This Congress, this President should be working to that end. 
   And third, we must pass legislation to fund the energy bill that passed the House last year, and then again this year, and call on our brethren in the other body to take action. 
   Unless we commit to providing leadership to transform our economy, this discussion remains the rhetoric of the last century really leaving us with a confused and unfulfilled daydream that has repeated itself for the last three decades. 
   As the American people face $4 gasoline and see our wealth drained from us, we must take a new course. We are past the point of words. Real deeds are required. And we must stop our economic hemorrhaging and begin investing in our own Midwest, in our own country, not the Middle East, and pass on a free republic to our posterity worthy of the sacrifices of our founders and all those who gave their all in freedom's cause. 
   Liberty's call in this new century demands energy independence now.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (FORECLOSURE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS: FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN OHIO -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, yesterday the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee of Financial Services held a major hearing in the City of Cleveland, Ohio. The subject was the foreclosure crisis facing the American people.  
   I want to thank Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS of Los Angeles, California, who did such a phenomenal job, all the Members who attended and certainly Chairman Frank, the chairman of the full committee, for allowing this proceeding to occur outside of Washington. 
   Cleveland, without a doubt, is ground zero in the mortgage foreclosure crisis facing Ohio. Although every quadrant of our State is suffering from rising foreclosures, the crisis is most acute in Cuyahoga County where nearly 15,000 new foreclosures occurred in 2007, a 350 percent increase compared to 10 years ago. Over 85,000 Ohioans have faced foreclosure, and we expect those numbers to increase as we look across our country and see homeowners nationwide just in the next 2 years lose nearly $356 billion on their property values with no end in sight. Some estimate the crisis will cost our country over $1 trillion. 
   Almost 9 million homeowners now owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth, the largest share since the Great Depression. If we really look at what has been happening, for the first time since World War II in the critical home mortgage sector, our largest form of an average family's net savings, net home equity is now negative. That is below 50 percent. As a whole, Americans owe more on their homes than they are worth. 
   This enormous loss of wealth affects not just homeowners but our Nation as a whole. We are a net debtor country, both publicly and privately. There have been inferences of a taxpayer bailout to prevent the financial collapse of major Wall Street banks and brokerages such as Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers are waiting in the wings, probably, for life support there too. 
   Most often, when a homeowner can't make ends meet, they lose their home. But when a giant firm like Bear Stearns can't make ends meet, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury get involved and billions of dollars of capital, much of it now from foreign places like Abu Dhabi, are found to fill the gap. 
   Mergers of banks are approved expeditiously and, just in case, the Federal Reserve opens its New York window with our taxpayers becoming the insurance company of last resort, pledging the full faith and credit of the United States to the big banks, and now, for the first time in history, to brokerages, to investment firms. Will ordinary homeowners in our Nation ever be afforded equal attention by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury? 
   It does not appear to be so with the rate of foreclosures and bankruptcies rising every month. There remains much Congress does not know about what got us here. An old professor of mine at the Harvard Business School used to say, ``If you want to know the way the world operates, follow the cash.'' 
   Yet Congress has not really followed the cash. It has not investigated the paper trails of firms, brokerages, regulatory boards, government bodies and key individuals who initiated and carried out these risky subprime and internationalized security practices. An equity washout of this magnitude does not happen by spontaneous combustion. It was willed to happen. 
   Specific people in specific places set the pieces in place to allow it to proceed. Many have been handsomely rewarded. America needs to know who they were and are. 
   It is incumbent that Congress authorize a full independent investigation of the tools of the roots of this crisis that trace back to the unstable period following the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s. The development of the internationalized mortgage security instrument itself deserves more attention. 
   In effect, it became a clever and high-risk credit device, with little transparency, that acted like a bank. It created money, or at least the illusion of it, in a Ponzi-like scheme. It did so without the normal regulatory restraints of full accounting and proper examination. 
   How could the regulators have let that happen? America should know the individuals and organizations that allowed these risky instruments and practices to proceed. 
   One of the first institutions to embark on subprime lending was Superior Bank of Hinsdale, Illinois. That bank had a return on assets 7 1/2 times the industry average, a CAMEL rating of only 2. Yet its executives were financially rewarded for presiding over ruin. 
   Where was the Office of Thrift Supervision? 
   I am going to place in the Record many questions the American people need to know answers to in order to figure out who is responsible for this crisis and to prevent further raids on the private savings of the American people.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (NAFTA AND ITS EFFECT ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, Senator John McCain, campaigning for President in Canada, of all places, criticized opponents of NAFTA, the godfather of all troubled trade agreements. Incredibly, the Senator said, ``Since NAFTA was concluded, it has contributed to strong job growth and flourishing trade.'' He didn't say where. He then said, ``Since the agreement was signed, the U.S. has added 25 million jobs and Canada more than 4 million.'' 
   Wherever is he getting his data? Most Americans know this so-called free trade agreement is anything but free. We know it has created huge job losses and trade deficits, and we know the harm it has caused in this country and across our continent. 
   NAFTA has created a gaping net hemorrhage of jobs, lost jobs and wealth for our country. I beg Senator McCain to look at the discipline of the numbers. Look at the trade accounts. They don't lie. 
   Since NAFTA's passage in 1993, our country has suffered $1 trillion of NAFTA trade loss, amassing a huge deficit with both Mexico and Canada. The figures get worse every single year. NAFTA has not only cost our country over 1 million lost jobs, we would have added even more economic growth and jobs if we had not allowed all these jobs and production lines to be outsourced. 
   Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute points out that ``growing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have pushed more than 1 million U.S. workers out of higher wage jobs and into lower wage positions in non-trade related industries. Thus, the displacement of 1 million jobs from traded to non-traded goods industries reduced wage payments to U.S. workers by $7.6 billion in 2004 alone.'' Those are staggering figures. 
   That loss packs a wallop by any measure. I will place in the RECORD a list of just some of the factories that have outsourced production and relocated to Mexico. They go from A to Z: Allied Signal, Amana, Maytag, you can go all the way down the list, Medtronics, Stanley Works, Zenith. I will place the entire list in the RECORD. 
   Now, it is interesting where Senator McCain was making his speech. He had not just outsourced himself to Canada to make the speech, he spoke before the Economic Club of Canada, a business organization whose membership cheered his remarks. And they should. They alone have made out handsomely under this lopsided trade agreement. 
   Listen to what the leader of the New Democratic Party in Canada, Parliamentarian Jack Layton, has to say about what is going on in Canada. In a recent letter to Senator Obama, Leader Layton stated clearly: ``Despite the fact that most Canadians are working longer hours, 80 percent of families have lost ground or stagnated in both earnings and after tax returns compared to the previous generation. Real wages have not increased in Canada for more than 30 years. Yet the share of corporate profits in our Canadian economy is at its highest point since 1961.'' 
   Thoughtful leaders in Canada disagree with Senator McCain. They know the income washout that can come from ill-cast trade agreements. He should pay attention to their views. 
   Before NAFTA, the United States had a trade surplus with Mexico of over $1 billion a year. Jobs were increasing in our country. Today, since NAFTA's passage, the U.S. has racked up an astounding $452.3 billion deficit with Mexico and an even larger $606 billion trade deficit with Canada. At a minimum, our Nation should seek balance and reciprocity, not deficits with these nations. 
   In Mexico, its civil society has been pleading with us to correct the abuses of NAFTA. Former Mexican Parliamentarian Victor Suarez pleads, ``We want good trade, not free trade.'' He should know well. The Mexican countryside has been devastated as the result of NAFTA as over 2 million poor farm families have been thrown off their land, uprooted in the most cruel of ways. A visible sign of their plight here is their illegal immigration to our Nation out of sheer desperation. 
   A group of farmers in Mexico calling themselves ``The Countryside Can't Take It Anymore'' literally rode their horses down to the Mexican Parliament to draw attention to the washout of livelihoods of their country men and women. 
   When NAFTA was first debated, many Members here tried to amend the agreement to avoid these negative consequences on people and communities. Senator McCain didn't lift a finger to help. Senator Obama was not a Senator then. 
   America should advance trade agreements that produce jobs, balances and surplus, not deficits. Deficits are not good, in your checkbook or in America's accounts. Trade should lift all boats, not create a race to the bottom. Good trade means fair trade for all, not ``gotcha'' trade. Good trade means good jobs, living wages, the right to bargain the worth of your labor by contract, a sustainable environment, and sovereign food rights for all people. 
   For a rich Nation like America, I think good trade also means a conscience for the poorest people on this continent, not exploitation. NAFTA has produced none of this. It has produced negatives. It is time America voted for positives.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (``NO'' ON PERU -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this week the new Congress, the Democratic Congress, will consider its first bilateral trade agreement during this session: the Bush-negotiated free trade agreement with Peru. This week, this Democratic Congress has an opportunity, an opportunity to prove that we are different from previous Congresses. We have an opportunity to demonstrate we have heard from America's voters who are fed up with job losses, trade deficits, and race-to-the-bottom wages for our middle class. 
   The American people expect us to reflect their concerns. Yet this bill is merely another godchild of NAFTA. 
   What is the public telling us? In a March 2007 poll by the Wall Street Journal/NBC before the recent scandals involving tainted food and toy imports, 54 percent of Democratic voters said free trade agreements have hurt the United States compared with 21 percent who said they have helped. 
   Then the Wall Street Journal in an October 4 front-page article stated that by a poll they had done, by a nearly 2 to 1 margin, Republican voters believe free trade is bad for the U.S. economy, a shift in opinion that mirrors Democratic views and suggests trade deals could face high hurdles under a new President. 
   And then a Democratic pollster found that 67 percent, two-thirds, of Americans believe unfair trade agreements are making it harder for Americans to keep good jobs. Thus, defeating the  Peru free trade agreement isn't just about politics. It is about what Democrats stand for in terms of policy. 
   Why should we defeat this bill? We should defeat the free trade agreement that the Bush administration negotiated on behalf of Peru first to protect America's farmers and America's workers. With a $3 billion trade deficit with Peru already, we have lost knit-wear jobs, we have lost agricultural jobs in onions and asparagus, and the list grows longer. We will only lose more jobs as we did with NAFTA unless you fix the innards of the agreements to stem the outsourcing in the first place. 
   We should defeat the Peru trade agreement to stand up for the 3 million soon-to-be displaced Peruvian small farmers who will fall victim to the flood of cheap South American imports that will come from adjoining countries because there are no readjustment provisions in the measure, just as there were no readjustment provisions under NAFTA and 2 million Mexican farmers got displaced, many of them fleeing to our country. Where are those 3 million Peruvian farmers supposed to go with no transition provisions in the agreement? 
   We should defeat the Peru agreement because it does not contain support ``Buy America'' policies in it. We should defeat the Peru trade agreement because we know the Bush administration cannot be trusted to enforce it. They haven't balanced any trade agreement. There are no accounts that are positive in these trade agreements that have been signed. In fact, this country this year will rack up close to a $1 trillion trade deficit with the world. The American people are saying stop, fix what is wrong before you do anything more. 
   Why would we adopt an agreement that will ruin the rain forest and put indigenous peoples at risk? Why would we do that to the Third World when we see demonstrations against the United States already all over Latin America. Wouldn't you think we would stand up for safe foods and safe imports? We know salmonella and other tainted foods are coming our way from Peru because so much of the seafood comes in here. Why don't we fix the inspection procedures before we adopt another free trade agreement that is not free in the end? 
   Why won't we adopt trade agreements that would ensure that Peruvians will still have access to medicines they need, despite the demands of a large pharmaceutical company? Why don't we stand up for the average person in these agreements? 
   Why would we support an agreement that is going to cause such hollowing out of Peruvian agriculture that they're going to have to displace that production with increasing coca production and illegal drugs? Why would we support an agreement like that? 
   We have to stop the perpetuation of the NAFTA model that leaves poverty and imbalance in its wake while failing to fulfill any promises of benefits to the middle class in either country. 
   Mr. Speaker, the New Direction Congress must take a new direction on trade, and I urge my colleagues to reject the Bush NAFTA expansion to Peru and support a new trade model that puts the peoples of the Americas first.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chairman, I rise to engage the fine gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) in a colloquy on unfair practices in the poultry and meat packing industries, and want to commend him for this incredibly visionary piece of legislation. It is a real credit to him, to his dogged work and expertise over so many years in this Congress as well as in the private sector. 
   The current contracted system of meat and poultry production often maneuvers farmers who do the actual work of raising and feeding billions of animals into subservient positions in today's marketplace and legal system. Poultry has become one of the most vertically integrated industries in our country, with four firms controlling nearly 60 percent of the broilers raised and sold. 
   Poultry, despite the worrisome rise of camphylobacter and salmonella through safety recalls, remains outside the normal oversight by USDA, even though GIPSA has oversight over beef and pork.     
   The Department of Agriculture has no real power to stop unfair practices in this industry. It surely has no mediation authority. Poultry contracts often are presented to farmers as take-it-or-leave-it contracts. In many cases farmers do not even see the actual contract until after they have gone to the bank. Farmers are not encouraged to negotiate contract terms that protect their interests, such as hedging against animal deaths and environmental cleanup costs, assuring accurate weights and measures and fair feed and input pricing, or gaining a fair share of the value of the nitrogen-rich manure produced by the animals themselves. 
   As the gentleman from Minnesota moves forward on the farm bill conference, I would urge him to give the USDA the full authority to protect against unfair practices in the poultry industry and to protect farmers' legal rights.  
   Please give farmers legal standing in court. Provide them with transparency in pricing, as well as technical assistance with fair contracts. Assure weights and measures. Help them hedge against animal deaths and environmental cleanups. Provide for legal and safe working conditions for chicken catchers who are their primary workforce. Bring honor to this industry with contracting fairness to farmers and their workers.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (TAKING CARE OF AMERICA'S VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, tonight I would like to discuss briefly another case of one of our very valiant soldiers who has returned to Ohio and numbers himself among the walking wounded. 
   My question to the President of the United States, my question to Members of this Congress, is what is wrong with the government of this country when we cannot move the bill we passed in this House that increased veterans spending by 18 percent, get it through the other body and to the President of the United States to sign? What is wrong with the way we govern that the President of the United States cannot call the leader of the other body and say, ``Move the bill so we can take care of the over 100,000 wounded that are coming home to us''? 
   The soldier I would like to talk about is only one of many that I met last Sunday who returned home from Iraq and is not being treated. This is a soldier who saw duty as a member of the 983rd Army Engineering Battalion, Combat, Heavy Duty, in Iraq, saw conflict, came home wounded, and is not getting treatment. 
   Here is what happened. There was an accident involving a truck and IEDs over there in Iraq and this particular soldier had a severe spinal cord injury and injuries to his head. In addition to that, since returning home, has had grand mal seizures, epileptic seizures. He never had that before he went to Iraq. 
   The military said, ``There is something wrong with him. We will give him a 60 percent disability. But we won't give him 100 percent disability, because maybe he got those injuries from playing football in high school.'' Football in high school? He never had seizures until he went to Iraq and got injured. 
   So the military says, ``Well, we will try to fix your neck.'' He goes through an operation in a hospital several hours away. It is very difficult for him to return there, because he doesn't have regular employment at this time and he is dealing with PTSD on top of everything else. 
   Now, why doesn't the government of the United States make it easy for wounded veterans, and we are not talking about 25 million people, we are talking about somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 Americans to get cared for closest to home? Why can't we do that? Why can't the President of the United States, he is Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, and this Congress, work together in the national interest to take care of all the soldiers that are coming home to us wounded? 
   In that particular unit that I visited on Sunday, there are many, many, many, many servicemembers who have PTSD. Why are they being asked to go 2 1/2 hours away from home, spend an entire day waiting in line at a hospital, and then maybe coming back home again and wasting a day when they don't get paid at work, if they have a job? Why can't we take care of them close to home? We are not talking about 25 million people. We are talking about a very discrete set of Americans who put their lives on the line for us, and yet we can't find a way to care for them? 
   I hope the President of the United States has somebody listening to this tonight, because as Commander-in-Chief, it would be very easy to call over to that other body and to move our Department of Veterans Affairs bill out of this Congress, up Pennsylvania Avenue, get it signed, and with dispatch get the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs and say, ``Work with the Congress. Work with the individuals who are here. Let's get these ill veterans to the care they need.'' 
   Why do we make it so hard? Why do we put the burden on the veteran? I had one veteran come up to me and say, ``Congresswoman, my knee is all messed up. I had an accident over there. Why did the DOD discharge me before fixing my knee?'' Now he has got to take weeks and weeks off of work, which he is unwilling to do, to try and go get an operation at a hospital very far from where he lives, and he doesn't have a support system in place. 
   Why would we do that? Why would the DOD not find a way to take a valorous veteran who is part of a combat engineering battalion and take care of him? Why do we let him fall between the cracks between the DOD and the VA? It is our responsibilities and the President's responsibility to care for these veterans, and we had best get at it.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (BIG OIL AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I imagine that I am not the only Member who hears from constituents regularly when oil companies report record profits, particularly with gas prices being what they have been over the past year. 
   Last Friday, the New York Times had this headline: World's Largest Oil Companies Gushing Profits. The Times story followed a report that ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly traded company, had enjoyed the largest annual profit for any company in history, almost $40 billion in 1 year, at a time when extraordinarily high gasoline prices were punishing the budgets of almost every family in our country and punishing the budgets of every business in our country. 
   Did ExxonMobil lower the prices at the pump to adjust for these egregious profits? Absolutely not. In its first order of business, it spent almost $10 billion to buy back its own stock, and then it took some of its profits to create a disinformation campaign against the panel on climate change. 
   And, finally, this week what did ExxonMobil do? It went after the State of Alabama, and lawyers for the company asked the Alabama Supreme Court to overturn a $3.5 billion punitive damage award that was made by a jury 3 years ago when it found that Exxon had defrauded the State of royalties for natural gas production in Mobile Bay. Actually, the original fine had been $11.9 billion. 
   You know, it must be hard being a giant oil company these days. It must be hard work making so much money you don't know how to spend it. That is not a problem most American families can relate to, but that is the problem that the giant oil companies face today. 
   The New York Times article reported that the world's 10 biggest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profit in 2004, more than the gross domestic product of all of Malaysia, and their sales were more than $1 trillion more than the gross domestic product of Canada. 
   The Associated Press reported earnings of ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, their earnings exceeded $142 billion, enough to buy every person in the United States 175 gallons of midgrade gasoline. Those combined profits, said the AP, surpassed the gross domestic product of Iraq and more than 160 other nations. 
   Keep in mind, 6 years ago before President Bush was placed in office, crude oil futures were trading below $15 a barrel, one-fourth less than today. The price of oil when President Bush was placed in office was $23.19 a barrel; last month, it was $52.25 a barrel. The dollar value of imports to the United States for the first 11 months of 2001, President Bush's first year in office, was $69.9 billion, but last year it was up 187 percent to $201.2 billion. When will we learn the true cost of our dependence on foreign oil? 
   It is no surprise that the world's largest oil reserves are located in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates. And the hot new area, of course, for exploration is Africa; and I imagine that may be a reason President Bush this week announced a new U.S.-Africa Command. 
   Not to take a back seat, the Peoples Republic of China has offered more than $5 billion in grants and loans in Africa, not out of the goodness of its heart, because we saw the compassion of the Chinese Government in Tiananmen Square, but China is interested in Africa's natural resources, including oil. And now the Bush administration is trying to play catch-up. 
   A cynic would say you could look at that list of nations and probably discern where the next war will break out, but that would be tantamount to saying that the Bush administration started a war with Iraq over oil, and we all know that cannot possibly be true. 
   But it is not hard to make the case between record high gasoline prices, record high oil company profits, and record high U.S. trade deficits.     
   The American people understand the connection. They live the connection every day, and they expect this Congress to do something about it. Not 25 years from now, not 20 or 15 years from now, but this year, to move our Nation toward energy independence with dispatch.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (NAFTA AND THE DRUG TRADE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this evening we are going to listen to the President of the United States, and I have no doubt in the State of the Union he will talk about the war on terrorism, and he will talk about the need to create jobs in Iraq to stabilize the terrible situation there, and he will talk about more funds for reconstruction of Iraq. Our Nation has already spent over $500 billion and rising in that sad country. 
   But I would like to focus on the United States just for a second, if I could, and talk about the terrorism focused inside of this country and point out that 90 percent of all the drugs that are smuggled into this country enter through our border with Mexico, and that is according to our State Department. In fact, under NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which his father negotiated, drug and drug-related smuggling across the Mexican border has risen to over $142 billion a year, according to our Drug Enforcement Agency.     
   Every single community in our country is affected, not just border communities. Every single jail, every single sheriff, every single law enforcement official, every single prison. Our communities are infected with burglaries, with robberies, with personal assaults related to the abuse of drugs in our country. I will be very interested to see what the President has to say about that war on terrorism tonight that affects every single neighborhood in this country. 
   NAFTA brings a significant increase in cargo traffic across our southern border and thus strains the enforcement efforts of our border patrols and enables traffickers and terrorists. In fact, 9,300 commercial trucks cross our border daily. 9,300 more trucks. And do you know how many we inspect? Five percent. Five percent. So there is a 95 percent chance for smugglers who are out there, whatever they want to get into this country, that will be their rate of success. 
   Now, the Mexican Government is working very hard to build a four-lane highway which they call La Entrada al Pacifico, the Entrance from the Pacific. And the idea there would be to redirect so much of the traffic from Asia, from China, these big ships that are bound for the United States, from the west coast, Ports of Los Angeles and Oakland, further south, and stretch the actual shipping lanes into Mexico versus the United States. It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the truck traffic will also be diverted from California and El Paso to the ports of entry at Presidio. 
   The idea is that the highway into our country would begin further south where goods would come in in deepwater ports, and the completed route would save up to 4 shipping days for goods moving between the Pacific Rim countries and Texas, which would be one of the major ports of entry into our country. 
   The problem is that we really haven't addressed the issue of drug smuggling as a part of this. Ninety percent, again, of all drugs smuggled into this country come over the Mexican border. That area has become almost lawless. Hundreds of murders related to drug trafficking go unaddressed both on the Mexican side of that border and our side. We really need to have a border enforcement organization that is negotiated by treaty by amending NAFTA in order that we can have proper enforcement along that very porous part of our country which makes us so vulnerable. 
   Our border guards are overwhelmed. We know that pedestrian traffic has increased by 55 percent across that border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and all kinds of vehicular traffic. Can you imagine that one place on that border accounts for 70 to 90 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States smuggled through that region? In fact, the drug cartels have moved up their major source of operation in Colombia up to the state of Juarez, and now control the state of Juarez just south of the State of Texas. This is real terrorism poised at our country. 
   Let's say the people in the Middle East want to get something into the United States. You mean to tell me they haven't thought about this? Of course they have. And we know that drug presence leads to more violence and more corruption at every level. 
   An unreleased Drug Enforcement Agency report notes that drugs, weapons, people traffickers, and terrorist organizations have to cross the border from Mexico into the United States, and they will use one of the many corridors available to them. I hope that the President of the United States tonight talks about securing our southern border.  
   Crossroads of Conflict--World Trade Bridge Has Changed the U.S.-Mexico Border, for Good and Bad  
   Laredo, Texas.--The mammoth globe on the World Trade Bridge spins in the glow of the Texas moon, welcoming hundreds of cargo trucks from Mexico to the United States' largest inland port. 
   Nighttime is the slowest time for the bridge. 
   During the day, literally thousands of trucks cross the span into the U.S., headed for destinations scattered throughout the Midwest and East and north into Canada. 
   Traffic between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, on Mexico's side of the bridge, is only expected to increase in coming years with Mexico anticipating billions of dollars in new trade, mainly from China, on its way to the United States, according to a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration executive summary. 
   Increasing trade has, however, been matched by growth in corruption and death in both border cities, though U.S. and Mexican officials are loathe to admit it. 
   $142 billion in drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
   86,000 Transportation jobs created as a result of the World Trade Bridge. 
   9,300 Commercial trucks pass through the World Trade Bridge daily. 
   90% of all drugs smuggled into the United States enter through its border with Mexico. 
   The prospect of expanded trade in Mexican states controlled by some of the country's most dangerous cartel leaders could pose serious national security challenges for the United States, an internal DEA report obtained by the Daily Bulletin explains. 
   The report, which has never been released, examines how already strained federal law enforcement agencies monitoring border security and narcotics will be challenged by not only Mexican and South and Central American drug trafficking organizations, but also by Asian cartels. 
   With slim resources to monitor cargo and inadequate border security measures in place, it will be next to impossible for U.S. agencies to stem the tide of contraband expected to enter the country from Mexico, the DEA report warns. Agencies will be hard-pressed to monitor the billions of dollars in contraband expected to enter the nation if U.S. officials don't take heed. 
   ``Contraband can be anything from narcotics, pirated videos, humans or weapons of mass destruction,'' said David Monnette, spokesman for the DEA in EI Paso, Texas. ``These drug trafficking organizations know that we are spread thin, and many times they use legitimate trade routes to move their contraband into the United States.  This report explains the possible dangers of not addressing these issues.''

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF ANDREW BURRIS -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to commemorate the life of Andrew Burris, a professional carpenter by trade, who gave his life today in Toledo, Ohio, as he helped place the finishing touches on the largest Federal transportation project in Ohio's history. Burris suffered fatal injury as he worked to complete Interstate 280's new river crossing known as the Veterans Glass City Skyway that spans the Maumee River, the largest river flowing into the Great Lakes. 
   At approximately 9:15 this morning, 36-year-old Andrew W. Burris, of Curtice, Ohio, fell to his death from a scaffolding on the north side of the bridge. He was a faithful and dedicated member of the Carpenters Union Local 1138. As a carpenter for nearly 10 years, his union brothers said Andrew loved his work and was an excellent carpenter. 
   The new skyway replaces the last drawbridge left on our Nation's interstate system. The cable-stayed bridge will carry three lanes of traffic in each direction over the river extending from I-75 on the north end to Navarre Avenue on the south end. The surface of the roadway will reach about 130 feet above the center of the river. 
   As our Nation builds forward, brick by brick, steel rod by steel rod, cement block by cement block, wood beam by wood beam, sometimes we forget the danger faced by the men and women skilled in these trades as they craft our monuments to civilization. It takes a tragedy like this to give us pause and say a silent prayer for all workers in their daily arduous labor. 
   Andrew's death is not the first tragedy to befall the workers on this new highway in the sky. On President's Day, 2004, a crane collapse on the Maumee River Crossing Bridge led to the death of four iron workers. This bridge to the future these men and women have been building is a monument and a testament to their work. 
   In the Record entry I offered following the death of those four iron workers on that fateful February day, I noted the men and women building the bridge had been about great deeds. We watch their incredible feats daily with admiration and, yes, with awe. We witness their minds, their muscles and hands forming of the Earth a new and better future for us all.     
   On the hottest summer days, as well as bone-chilling, subzero temperatures of winter in the north, they toiled fearlessly above us creating a majestic expression of who they were and who we are as a people. 
   We humbly acknowledge and publicly recognize them for their heroic, steadfast, and artful deeds as building tradesmen. The men who lost their lives leave not only their mastery of iron and concrete and steel and the creation of beauty from it as their legacy, but more importantly, they leave cherished lives and families. 
   The same is true of Andrew Burris. Though his life was cut short, he leaves a legacy in the bridge he helped create and in all that his carpenter's hands produced. Emily Dickinson's poem ``In This Short Life'' tells us: 
   ``In this short life 
   That lasts an hour 
   How much--how little--is 
   Within our power.'' 
   And as we live our lives, all are affected by tragedy, some small and some great. It is the trials and tragedies of life which make us stronger and make the joys of life so much sweeter. I know this lesson of life does not decrease the sadness and pain felt by all those who knew and loved Andrew Burris. Our entire community offers its sympathy to those who called him father, husband, son, brother, friend, colleague. We celebrate him in recalling the words in ``A Song of Life'' by Ella Wheeler Wilcox: 
   ``In the rapture of life and of living, 
   I lift up my head and rejoice, 
   And I thank the great Giver for giving, 
   The soul of my gladness a voice. 
   I lift up my eyes to Apollo, 
   The god of the beautiful days 
   And my spirit soars off like a swallow 
   And is lost in the light of its rays. 
   Come out of the world--come above it-- 
   Up over its crosses and graves, 
   Though the green Earth is fair and I love it, 
   We must love it as masters, not slaves. 
   Come up where the dust never rises-- 
   But only the perfume of flowers-- 
   And your life shall be glad with surprises 
   Of beautiful hours. 
   Come up where the rare golden wine is 
   Apollo distills in my sight, 
   And your life shall be happy as mine is, 
   And as full of delight.''

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (NEW VERSION OF NAFTA -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Congress is now faced with a so-called new trade policy with regard to Peru, Panama, Colombia and South Korea. But this deal is not a new direction for trade; it's a variation of the same old theme. 
   We have seen how NAFTA has sucked a million good jobs out of our country and ruined millions of lives in Mexico and driven so many desperate illegal immigrants across our border. We have seen how so-called free trade with a closed and manipulative China has led to soaring deficits, increasing outsourcing of our jobs, and lax labor and environmental standards not just in Asia, but around the world in a race to the bottom. Tainted Chinese food is not just being sent here for our pets, but for our people. 
   The trade policy released last week does not make any major changes to this trade regimen. It does not aim at yielding a more balanced set of trade accounts for our country, or even opening the closed markets of the world. It doesn't fix agreements that aren't working to our advantage or even to be fair to both sides. There is nothing in this deal about the privatization of public works, for example, in water or in sanitation or health care that are inherent in what has been negotiated. If Democrats oppose privatizing Social Security here in the United States, why would we require privatizing the Peruvian social security system? Now, why would we do that? 
   This NAFTA replica presents a nonbinding list of requests that has the illusion of enforceability, but sacrifices more of our middle class to global investors. 
   In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said it supports this rehashed agenda because of, and I quote, assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to comply with ILO conventions. 
   These repackaged NAFTA agreements do not reflect a desire for a new trade model that many Members of Congress and vast majorities of the American people expect. And I am truly saddened that those who have cobbled these deals together make light of the people of our country and other countries who have been so deeply hurt by these agreements, by denying them a seat at the tables of testimony in this very Congress. In fact, their methods are most undemocratic. 
   Last March NBC and the Wall Street Journal conducted a poll asking the American people, do you think free trade agreements between the United States and foreign countries have helped the United States, have hurt the United States or have not made much of a difference? Forty-six percent of respondents answered U.S. trade agreements have hurt this country. Only 28 responded, half as many, said they have helped. 
   The American people want free trade among free people, and they want a trade policy that encourages U.S. economic growth and job creation here at home. 
   It is irresponsible to continue to reword the same agreements and expect that our constituents are naive enough to accept it as real change. 
   A new trade policy must respect the dignity of work, the rule of law, the equality of sexes, the nobility of the environment and the value of the person. 
   We cannot continue to stand for trade policies, binding or not, that degrade the value of the working class and cost money, jobs and lives as we see in the wake of NAFTA and in all of the trade agreements that mirrored it. 
   Our constituents realize that our current trade policy is more harmful than helpful. And before we encourage the remaking of NAFTA for Peru, Colombia, Panama, South Korea, we need to revisit U.S. trade policy and make comprehensive changes. We cannot extend fast track until we fix what is wrong with existing agreements that yield these job hemorrhages. 
   I applaud those of our distinguished colleagues who are here this evening who are working very hard to change this trade model to make it thorough, to make it fair, to make it a balanced situation for the people of our country, and to treat the people of the Third World with respect. 
   I look forward to participating in genuinely reshaping the future of international trade to reshape jobs being created here at home and the economic policies that are so vital to the future for our people in order that they can move into the middle class again, rather than falling out. We have a long way to go.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (BRIDGE LOAN FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it's a particular joy this evening to have Congressman Nick Lampson in the Chair as Speaker Pro Tem and thank him for his remarkable and exemplary service to the people of the United States. 
   Tonight, I would like to address the subject of the fact that a majority of House Members today voted for a bridge loan, a very tightly structured bridge loan, to throw a lifeline to American workers, American communities, American manufacturing, to save American jobs, in fact, one of every 10 jobs in our country. They're jobs not just in the so-called automotive assembly plants, but twice as many jobs in the automotive parts plants, the steel industry, the plastic industry, the semi-conductor industry, even the textile industry. Nearly half of that production is used in automotive products. It is simply staggering the way in which this integrated set of production occurs in our country. 
   What was passed was a bridge loan to the auto industry, and I underline the word ``loan.'' It has to be paid back. It has to be paid back in 7 years, and it has to be paid back with interest, 5 percent interest over the first 5 years, and 9 percent interest over the last 2 years.  
   It requires restructuring by March 31, severe restructuring in order to place the United States in a competitive position again in our country and globally. It requires enormous sacrifice. 
   Now, what's interesting to me is the amount of the total loan was $15 billion; yet Wall Street received $700 billion plus, $750 billion, in that bill that passed here. There were no such requirements. There's no mandatory payback. There are no sacrifices that are as significant as they're being asked of this manufacturing industry, and the manufacturing of automobiles is a really tangible, goods producing industry. It creates real value. It creates wealth because you sell something. Wall Street's bailout is basically accounting and paper trades. They don't really produce anything. 
   And one of the points I want to make tonight is that in order to lead America forward out of this deep, deepening recession in which we find ourselves, we have to manufacture our way out. We have to grow our way out of it, and we are not in recession because of the automotive industry. In fact, the reverse is true. The auto industry is the victim of the credit crunch caused by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The bailout of Wall Street, the improper bill that was passed here, is making the situation worse, and it's affecting industries like the automotive industry. 
   I visited the U.S. Treasury Department today as well to share a list of foreclosures just in my home county of Lucas County in Toledo, Ohio. That is 4,100 homes since the beginning of this year. Before the end of January of next, an additional 600 families will lose their homes just in that county because the TARP program, the Wall Street bailout program, is not working at the local level. The list is so long I could roll it through the Chamber and out that door, and there would still be more paper left, and that's with four columns. In fact, it could probably be rolled over to the Senate for the size that it is. 
   Now, why is the Treasury program not working? The first reason it's not working is Treasury's not a housing agency. Its experience is not in resolving mortgage workouts. More paper shuffling isn't going to solve the problem. 
   What's happening over at Treasury is they're buying banks. They are concentrating the banking system of this country rather than doing mortgage workouts, and they're concentrating them up on Wall Street, and the big banks like PNC, which has just bought National City Bank in the State of Ohio, National City shouldn't have been purchased. A workout should have been done in Ohio for the loans that gravitated to Ohio and may have been troubled. Seventy-five percent of the loans were working before the Treasury Department took over. The problem is that the Treasury Department is like a truck with several wheels, and they're all going in a different direction. There's not coordination. 
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation should be involved to do the mortgage workouts on the books of local banks. That's really not happening for most of the loans at risk. 
   The Securities and Exchange Commission should be taking a look at their accounting standards and marking them to true value. 
   You know, in order to fix the automotive industry, you've got to fix the mortgage industry, and the Wall Street bailout isn't working. 
   Mr. Speaker, Godspeed to you in your future years.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, not so many years ago two famous American artists, Josh Stone and Dionne Warwick, created a song called, ``What's it all about, Alfie?'' Here is how the song began: 
   ``What's it all about, Alfie? 
   Is it just for the moment we live? 
   What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie? 
   Are we meant to take more than we give?'' 
   On June 19 this week, 2008, the New York Times lead story said quite a bit about taking. The headline reads, ``Deals With Iraq Are Set To Bring the Oil Giants Back.'' I hope every American reads the lead story in the New York Times this week, June 19, a story written by Andrew Kramer. 
   Here is some of what it says. It says Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total, and BP, along with some other companies like Chevron, and a number of smaller oil companies, are in talks with Iraq's oil ministry for no-bid contracts, I repeat, no-bid contracts to service Iraq's largest fields. The no-bid contracts are unusual for the industry. Many experts consider these contracts to be their best hope for large-scale increases in production over there. And it talks a lot about the politics of global oil and how other places like Bolivia and Venezuela and Russia and Kazakhstan aren't so friendly to the United States anymore as we become totally dependent on imported fuel. And it says that the biggest prize everybody is waiting for is the development of these new oil fields. 
   But of course we have to be careful because these mother lodes are threatened by insurgents who don't like the fact that western companies are coveting their resources. And here we live in a country now where gas is over $4 a gallon. It would be so easy just to take it. And as the song says, are we meant to take more than we give? 
   Technically, these no-bid deals, more no-bid from this administration, are structured as service contracts. As such, they do not require the passage of an oil law setting out terms for competitive bidding. The legislation has been stalled by disputes among Shiites, Sunni and Kurdish parties over revenue sharing and other conditions inside that country where their parliament is in turmoil and cannot pass a hydrocarbon law. And thus, outsiders come in and are covetous of those resources. The whole process is designed to circumvent the legislative stalemate. I might say, how convenient. How convenient. 
   And so Americans should ponder the connection between our dependence. Now almost 75 percent of what people pump into their tanks comes from resources from other places, and think about how serious we had best be as a country to become energy independent here at home so we can restore our independence again because every American family that can't afford to drive to work anymore or go on vacation is less free than they were a year ago. 
   And the year 1998 is very important because that is the year when America began importing over half of what we consume. Every year we become less and less free. 
   It is really sad what is happening in the world. I mourn for my country as we approach Independence Day that she is not free. And the way we are going to fix this is for Americans to really understand the nature of our predicament. 
   I would prefer not to send America's finest to wars over oil, but that is exactly what we have done. And it will cost upwards of a trillion dollars already to pay for their deployment. It is important to think about the words to that song: Are we meant to take? I really think we are meant to create. The way this country was born out of people's highest ideals, to create a Nation that could be self-sustaining within its own borders without all these interlocking, foreign entailments that George Washington warned us about over 200 years ago. Maybe some Americans have forgotten, but we shouldn't  forget. We should remember what it means to be free. 
   Again, June 19, lead story, New York Times, ``Deals With Iraq Are Set To Bring the Oil Giants Back.'' It is required reading for every American who has a heart where freedom beats.  
   Deals With Iraq Are Set To Bring Oil Giants Back  
   BAGHDAD.--Four Western oil companies are in the final stages of negotiations this month on contracts that will return them to Iraq, 36 years after losing their oil concession to nationalization as Saddam Hussein rose to power. 
   Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total and BP--the original partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company--along with Chevron and a number of smaller oil companies, are in talks with Iraq's Oil Ministry for no-bid contracts to service Iraq's largest fields, according to ministry officials, oil company officials and an American diplomat 
   The deals, expected to be announced on June 30, will lay the foundation for the first commercial work for the major companies in Iraq since the American invasion, and open a new and potentially lucrative country for their operations. 
   The no-bid contracts are unusual for the industry, and the offers prevailed over others by more than 40 companies, including companies in Russia, China and India. The contracts, which would run for one to two years and are relatively small by industry standards, would nonetheless give the companies an advantage in bidding on future contracts in a country that many experts consider to be the best hope for a large-scale increase in oil production 
   There was suspicion among many in the Arab world and among parts of the American public that the United States had gone to war in Iraq precisely to secure the oil wealth these contracts seek to extract. The Bush administration has said that the war was necessary to combat terrorism. It is not clear what role the United States played in awarding the contracts; there are still American advisers to Iraq's Oil Ministry. 
   Sensitive to the appearance that they were profiting from the war and already under pressure because of record high oil prices, senior officials of two of the companies, speaking only on the condition that they not be identified, said they were helping Iraq rebuild its decrepit oil industry. 
   For an industry being frozen out of new ventures in the world's dominant oil-producing countries, from Russia to Venezuela, Iraq offers a rare and prized opportunity. 
   While enriched by $140 per barrel oil, the oil majors are also struggling to replace their reserves as ever more of the world's oil patch becomes off limits. Governments in countries like Bolivia and Venezuela are nationalizing their oil industries or seeking a larger share of the record profits for their national budgets. Russia and Kazakhstan have forced the major companies to renegotiate contracts. 
   The Iraqi government's stated goal in inviting back the major companies is to increase oil production by half a million barrels per day by attracting modern technology and expertise to oil fields now desperately short of both. The revenue would be used for reconstruction, although the Iraqi government has had trouble spending the oil revenues it now has, in part because of bureaucratic inefficiency. 
   For the American government, increasing output in Iraq, as elsewhere, serves the foreign policy goal of increasing oil production globally to alleviate the exceptionally tight supply that is a cause of soaring prices. 
   The Iraqi Oil Ministry, through a spokesman, said the no-bid contracts were a stop-gap measure to bring modern skills into the fields while the oil law was pending in Parliament. 
   It said the companies had been chosen because they had been advising the ministry without charge for two years before being awarded the contracts, and because these companies had the needed technology.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I would like to deeply thank, Mr. Chairman, the chairman of our Budget Committee, the very able and distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, JOHN SPRATT, who has led our committee to produce a budget that will balance in the next 5 years with no tax increase. It is going to take pay-as-you-go and it is going to take a real regimen to correct America's net negative savings rate. 
   Certainly, the Bush administration has done much damage in the last 6 years by making a mess of fiscal policy, just as it has made a mess of foreign policy; and now we have got these overhanging budget deficits and trade deficits. For, in fact, in 2001, the administration inherited a projected 10-year surplus of nearly $6 trillion; and within 2 years alone the surplus had been eliminated and we began piling up debt, adding $2.8 trillion over 6 years, much of it purchased by foreign investors, which I will talk about here in just a second. 
   I want to thank Chairman Spratt for doing what is right for America. Many organizations, like the Concord Coalition, states, ``Thus, to be clear, the Democratic budget resolution does not call for nor require a tax increase.''  
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said this month as well, ``The House Democratic plan does not include a tax increase.'' 
   And the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution of this month also says, ``The Democratic budget would not raise taxes.'' 
   I think that those on the other side of the aisle doth protest too much, because, in fact, you didn't produce this kind of budget. Now, you might be well intentioned. I used to think Republicans balanced budgets. I have since learned differently after serving here in this Congress. 
   I want to talk about what is so dangerous about the debt that the Republicans and the Bush administration have accrued. If you look at who is footing the bill, it is foreign countries, Japan, the oil-producing and exporting nations, China. In fact, China now holds over $1 trillion in U.S. dollar reserves, and they are looking to diversify away from the Dow. And if you look at what is happening to the price of gold, it is skyrocketing as the U.S. dollar's worth is dropping. 
   Our accounts are badly out of order. This budget maintains in the reserve account all of the tax breaks that were given to the American people, the extension of the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, extension of the research and air experimentation tax credit, extension of the deduction for State and local sales taxes, school construction bonds and so forth. 
   So even with the incredible drag of the Iraq war on our Federal budget and our Nation's economy, this Democratic budget that Chairman Spratt and members of our committee have produced does achieve balance within 5 years. It is rigorous, it will make the Nation more healthy, and I just want to commend him for taking a most difficult challenge and doing what is right for the American people, for our children and grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR THE GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me, and will place quite a bit of information in the Record on what Democrats are trying to do here in order to put America on an energy independent path. But it is pretty difficult when you have a Bush administration that vetoes everything that we try to do, or threatens it, and you have the kind of speeches that are occurring down here today. 
   We have got an oil man as the President of this country. His right-hand fellow over there from Wyoming, Mr. Cheney, ran Halliburton, an oil servicing company. So you pretty well know what you have got sitting over there in the White House. 
   Since they became President and Vice President, this country is importing 1 billion more barrels of oil every year, 1 billion barrels more under the Bush administration. This is not a recipe for energy independence in our country. 
   This week it was embarrassing to see Secretary Paulson over in Abu Dhabi asking them to, gee, you know, still believe in the dollar, and all of the investors over there made rich by these oil petro dollars, largely U.S. dollars, watching our Secretary give that set of remarks. Similarly, President Bush a couple of weeks ago went to Saudi Arabia and sort of drilled around in the Middle East to see if he could find any additional sources of supply, begging the oil barons. 
   You know, it wouldn't take that much for him to direct his limousine right up here to Congress, not the Middle East. We have got some rooms over here on this side; we could sit around and talk about what can we agree on in terms of energy independence, what can we agree on here in order to do together what we cannot do alone. Make America energy independent. 
   As the gentlelady from California said, the President even vetoed the farm bill where we put in a major new title dealing with biofuels. Rural America wants to help lift this country to energy independence. 
   We are trying to get additions to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve suspended for the moment in order to give some price relief to the American people. Gee, it would be great if President Bush would kind of help us out on that. 
   He hasn't supported any of our renewable energy bills down here on the floor. In fact, if you look at the energy bill that he produced up there, that big report in his first term, he doesn't even deal with renewables. When you have got an oil perspective at the head of the machine, the car doesn't go in the right direction. 
   And so it seems to me, look at the record. Look at what he has done and not done on these--The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, no support there. Trying to get OPEC and the big oil companies to have some accountability, he doesn't support us on that. Rather than the President taking trips over to the Middle East, he ought to just come right up Pennsylvania Avenue here to the Congress. Meet with the chairs of our committees who really do care about this, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Markey, Speaker Pelosi. We have got a lot of people here willing to talk. But the President is sending the Secretary of the Treasury over to Abu Dhabi and he himself over to Saudi Arabia. What does that tell the American people? A billion more barrels a year imported every year since he became President. 
   We don't have a partner to deal with over there at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. And that is why the American people are changing the people being elected here. They know America needs change. They want real leadership. They know they are not getting it.  
   So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is time to deal. Get the President. Let's talk about something serious for the sake of the Republic. 
   Here's a list:

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (JAMES M. & THOMAS W.L. ASHLEY CUSTOMS BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. I rise today and ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3712, which seeks to name the Federal Courthouse Building located in Toledo Ohio, the James M. Ashley and Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley Customs Building and United States Courthouse.     
   This deserved recognition of two well-known lawmakers from the Ashley family, whose roots run deep in America and our community, pays tribute to the lives of late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley who served here in the 19th century, as well as his great-grandson, former Congressman Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, who served here during the 20th century. 
   These visionary Americans who lived in three different centuries advanced America's promise and the cause of social justice as they made immeasurable public service contributions to both define and direct the course of our Nation, one in the abolitionist fight to eliminate slavery in our Nation, and the other to bind up America's wounds in the civil rights era to help our Nation gain its idealistic foothold again. 
   Congressman James Ashley, who served in our U.S. House of Representatives from December 1859 to March 1869, was an active abolitionist credited with introducing the first bill for the 13th Amendment to our constitution to abolish the practice of slavery. He also drafted a bill to abolish slavery in Washington, DC. These extraordinarily brave actions in his era are illustrative of Ashley's courageous leadership. They reflect the Ashley family's place in history on the scales of justice and equality for all people. 
   During his tenure in Congress, James Ashley served as chairman of the Committee on Territories, and he was later appointed Governor of Montana. Congressman Thomas Ludlow Ashley, great-grandson of James Ashley from Lucas County, Toledo, Ohio, served a quarter century, 13 terms, from January 1955 to January 1981. During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the Select Committee on Energy where he was chosen by then-Speaker Thomas Tip O'Neill to prepare comprehensive legislative proposals across congressional committees to regain America's energy independence. 
   During that era of the 1970s, that landmark legislation, the Energy Conservation Act of 1976, and subsequent Carter administration energy independence proposals became America's first step on an arduous journey into a new energy age. 
   He also served as chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marines and Fisheries and as assistant majority whip for the Democrats in the House. 
   Lud was an outstanding leader in both community development and energy policy. As Chair of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee for the Banking Committee, he, like his great-grandfather before him, championed social justice. He wrote and gained passage of the Demonstration City Act and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and 1977 to rebuild America's cities and communities in the wake of the civil rights era. 
   Indeed, the very establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Lyndon Johnson administration was made possible by Lud's effective and dogged congressional leadership. Housing for the less fortunate and more sustainable communities across our country were made possible through his unyielding and creative efforts. A banker's banker, he also gained passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, the Export Development Administration Act of 1969, the Export Expansion and Finance Act of 1971.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE RED INK KEEPS GETTING DEEPER -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the topic of my remarks tonight will be ``The Red Ink Keeps Getting Deeper.'' 
   If we look at the trade procedure the Bush administration wants Congress to pass called Fast Track, we should know that it is shorthand for Congress blindly signing away its constitutionally granted duty to regulate commerce with foreign nations. That is right in the Constitution. Under Fast Track procedure, Congress loses any opportunity to negotiate, amend, or improve the Bush administration's misguided trade policy. 
   We have seen what happens when Congress hands the reins over to the executive branch. When we look at our soaring trade deficit and our ravaged middle-class communities, we see how Congress could have improved each one of the trade agreements we were forced to consider as a whole under what was called Fast Track. It is like a fast ball through here that you can't even amend. 
   The Commerce Department just released an example of the Bush administration's horrendous leadership on this issue. The first quarter account for 2007 is another $193 billion deficit in the red, which totals 5.7 percent of GDP, a total drag on economic growth in this country. And, in fact, this quarter's debt is larger than the last quarter of 2006. The red ink keeps getting deeper every single quarter. 
   Our national security is forced to take a back seat to foreign investment while workers lose their pensions and their health benefits or their jobs, and illegal immigrants scramble across our borders attempting to flee the destruction caused by our failed trade policies in those countries. This should not be happening. 
   When Congress reclaims our power to amend trade agreements, we can use trade policy in a manner to level the  playing field, to help people and not just fan the flames of more corporate greed in the global marketplace. 
   Congress cannot accept Fast Track in any form. We must demand and create a new model for trade that has not just a logic but also an ethic. We must bring people back into the trade equation, not just investors. 
   Our trade policy touches people around the world, from middle-class Americans in the heart of this country to Mexican corn and bean farmers facing extinction come next January as some of NAFTA's provisions phase out for them. Our trade policy touches factory workers in China toiling for starvation wages. 
   We, as most powerful Nation in the world, must accept our responsibility to protect people from corporate greed and our own people from security risks. We cannot trust President Bush to defend our jobs. We have seen he has not been able to do that. And we cannot watch him dictate trade policies that Congress is blocked from amending. We have to take the responsibility given to us in our Constitution. 
   Instead of approving more lopsided trade agreements, Congress should fix our current situation. Trade should create jobs in America. It should not exploit Third World workers. It should elevate, not reduce, America's image abroad. Congress should fund the North American Development Bank to support job creation in communities where jobs have been offshored and outsourced. And we should require our trade competitors to adhere to environmental standards. We should abolish child labor worldwide. We should stop labor trafficking. And we should fix our broken immigration system that is so tied to failed trade policies. A new trade model must be created that meets America's most principled values, democratic rights and justice for all. 
   Under Fast Track authority, however, Congress cannot even control our own floor schedule. President Bush will decide what policy we consider and when we vote on it. We simply can't accept that. Congress must reclaim its own power. Democrats must lead the way to a more sensible and ethical trade policy that brings prosperity to people here at home as well as around the world, restores our reputation abroad, and advances democratic principles, that's with a small ``d,'' respect for people. 
   The world has suffered at the hands of Bush administration trade policies for too long. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any more blank checks for this President or any President who tries to move a trade agreement through here on renewing Fast Track. Congress ought to reject Fast Track and we should stop making the red ink deeper.

<DOCNO>Mrs. KAPTUR. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. 
   Although the bill before us today does not go as far as it needs to go, it is an incremental step towards a long-overdue solution, a solution that continues to be blocked by moneyed pharmaceutical interests that are more interested in the profits their medications can bring than in the good their medications can do. The American people deserve better, and that is why I continue to say that if we are to achieve real reform in this institution, we need to start with campaign finance reform. 
   In my view, Medicare represents a covenant between the U.S. government and its citizens. During my tenure in the House of Representatives, I have always supported Medicare and Social Security as important lifelines for seniors in our country.  
   As part of these efforts, I have advocated fair, affordable, easy-to-use prescription drug coverage for seniors under Medicare. Unfortunately, the Medicare Modernization Act falls far short of these goals. Ever since its inception, the MMA has been a nightmare both for legislators and, more importantly, for the seniors who must try to navigate it. 
   Under this law, the government is prohibited from using its buying power to negotiate lower prices for America's 30 million seniors. I object strongly to this provision because I believe firmly that something must be done to bring down the cost of prescription drugs in America. 
   In fact, when the MMA was first being developed and passed through the House, I attempted to offer an amendment that would have allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices under the auspices of the Medicare program. 
   Unfortunately, after being kept waiting until the wee hours of the morning, while the Rules Committee met far from the watchful eye of the American public and even most Members of Congress, I was not allowed even to offer my amendment for consideration. 
   Therefore, I am glad that today we are debating a bill that will accomplish my goal, and under a system that has already worked to save our veterans money under the VA's healthcare system. H.R. 4 will begin to save money for beneficiaries both through lower drug costs at the pharmacy counter and lower plan premiums. 
   Lower prices will also slow entry into the donut hole, when beneficiaries must pay the full price of their medicines. And since taxpayers fund more than three-quarters of the cost of the drug benefit, we will be saving them money, too. 
   This bill does not, however, prevent the prescription drug plans from getting deeper discounts. And the bill does not allow the HHS Secretary to establish a national formulary or otherwise restrict access to medicines. 
   Mr. Speaker, our nation's seniors, members of the ``greatest generation,'' deserve better than having to choose between buying food or buying life-sustaining and often, life-saving medications. 
   I am pleased today to support this legislation which represents a first step in eliminating that cruel choice and helping to ensure that seniors can live their lives in good health and with dignity.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (U.S. TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the United States has just announced the second highest monthly trade deficit for this year, $60 billion. That is just in the month of May. Our Nation continues to import more goods and services than we export at alarming rates, with a record $192 billion more coming into this country in the earlier part of this year than going out. 
   This particular chart shows the top category of concern, imported petroleum, which has continued to rise, including in this Presidential administration, despite President Bush's statement at the beginning of his administration that we have a serious problem. America is addicted to oil, which is being imported from some of the most unstable parts of the world. He said that, and yet he continued to allow the import of more petroleum. 
   Americans are watching as our government does nothing to curb these growing trade deficits, with their accompanying job losses, deteriorating labor conditions and community washouts that U.S. trade policy leaves in its wake. 
   A bill I have sponsored, H.R. 169, the Balancing Trade Act of 2007, requires the President, if over 3 consecutive calendar years the United States has a trade deficit with another country that totals over $10 billion, to take the necessary steps to create a trading relationship that would eliminate or substantially reduce that trade deficit by entering into better agreements with that country. In other words, if the United States runs a substantial deficit with any one country, the President must report back to Congress on his plans for correcting that imbalance. This is a very constructive first step to correct the path of U.S. trade policy which is yielding this red ink. 
   Our bill calls attention to those countries who are taking advantage of our willingness to import goods from them while they block our access to their markets. Our two largest deficits in 2006, for example, were first with China. This is a country we have amassed a $232.5 billion deficit. That is an enormous amount, comprising about a quarter of what we have amassed with all countries in the world. And the deficit with China has just grown at alarming proportions. 
   The next largest deficit is with Japan. That has been a lingering deficit that has been growing over the years. It now totals about one-third of what we accumulate with China; it's about $88.4 billion. And every billion in deficit equals a loss of between 10,000 and 20,000 jobs in this country. That is a displacement in production in this country, putting it someplace else. 
   Now, these deficits have persisted for years, which makes them particularly troublesome. This chart illustrates our deficit with China pre and post what is called ``normal trade relations'' with China. We had a very bad deficit already back in the late 1990s, but with the adoption of permanent trade relations with China, that deficit has more than doubled.  
   If we had taken steps to correct this deficit at the beginning of the downward turn rather than turning our backs on it and allowing more red ink with China, our country would be stronger today. It would not have the kind of annual budget deficits that we're having. And we would be more economically secure here at home and, frankly, politically secure in the world. Instead, we continue to sacrifice our jobs to the lowest bidders in closed markets that do not follow rules of free trade. Free trade can be productive and it can be profitable, but only if it is free trade among free people. 
   Trading with closed economies that manipulate currency, that choose not to enforce what scant labor standards they might have, and otherwise levy very restrictive non-tariff barriers against our products harm our economy. America, wake up. We can no longer ignore the games that our competition is playing with us. We must trade for America; not for secret, nontransparent governments to prosper off our unwillingness to hold them to democratic standards or, at the very least, the rules of truly free trade among free people. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in requiring the President to address this issue by cosponsoring our bill, H.R. 169. We must take action to reduce the trade deficit and restore our economic independence, competitiveness and begin creating jobs across our country again.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Congressman Michaud, Congresswoman Sutton and Congressman Braley, I wanted to come to the floor tonight and say it is so wonderful to have you here in this beloved House, to try to course correct on a direction that the United States has been heading in the wrong direction now for over two decades. And with the new energy that you represent and the new leadership, I have no doubt that when fast track comes up for reauthorization later this year, we are going to stop it dead in its tracks and begin turning our country around again. 
   I just wanted to run to the floor just for a couple of minutes to put some notes in the Record and to say that for 23 years Congress has really doled out to the executive branch our trade-making authority under Article I, section 8. 
   If you go back to 1975 when fast track was first passed, the United States had trade balances up until then for almost the entirety of our history. Then as you look at each succeeding agreement, whether you go to 1993 and NAFTA, we were already amassing trade deficits after the first fast track was passed back in the seventies. 
   Then when PNTR with China was passed, plus NAFTA, plus all the other agreements that were signed, we moved into the most historic deficits represented by the lost jobs that Congresswoman Sutton talked about, that Congressman Braley talked about, Congressman Michaud you talked about and personally lived through. 
   So we have seen real wages stagnant with those jobs lost. We have seen our jobs move overseas to the lowest-wage countries in the world, the most undemocratic. We have seen child labor flourish. We have seen bonded labor come back into our country as a result. We have global warming taking hold as our environmental regulations are really overturned under agreements like NAFTA. Illegal immigrants stream across our borders because they are treated like they have no value in their home countries. Our trade deficit continues to soar, and the drug trade locks in heavily. 
   So I wanted to come down tonight and present some of these figures and say that there is a pattern to history now. You are like the second wave. You are coming in here. Those of us who fought so hard against NAFTA in 1993, those of us who tried so hard to course-correct, we never had the votes. Unfortunately, it was so close; it was so very close. But people hadn't lived the washout. You now represent places that have experienced the results of this. 
   So we look forward to this coming vote this summer. It is such a joy to have you here, and I just wanted to thank you for your really determined leadership and for the people who voted you here so that you could come to Washington and make a difference. We so very, very much need your voices here.  
   When Fast Track expires at the end of June this year, Congress can reclaim our authority granted by Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' For 23 years, Congress and the working class watched the executive branch commandeer U.S. trade policy. We also saw real wages stagnate, American jobs move overseas, child labor flourish, global warming take hold, illegal immigrants stream across our borders, our trade deficit soar, and the drug trade thrive. 
   Like many of us here, I receive thousands of letters, phone calls, and e-mails from my constituents asking me to take action on these important issues. 
   While there is no one cause for any of these problems, Congress cannot ignore how U.S. trade policy impacts the full range of issues affecting Americans and the world. Congress must respond to the American people who demand action from us. 
   Congress has yielded enough power to the executive branch. If we renew Fast Track and continue to cede our Constitutionally-granted authority, we will only render ourselves more helpless in the face of a broken immigration system, economic instability, an environmental crisis, and a burgeoning drug trade. 
   Our previous trade agreements may not have been the sole causes of these emergencies, but trade policy is the key to solving them. 
   Congress needs to examine the root causes of our immigration problem and the exploitation of workers across the Americas. When the leaders of U.S., Mexico, and Canada signed NAFTA 14 years ago, they turned their backs on working men and women across the continent. The agreement continues to chip away at the U.S. economy, leaving millions jobless and accumulating a staggering and growing trade deficit with Mexico, now totaling a record $64.1 billion for 2006. At the same time, NAFTA ravaged the Mexican economy and destroyed the farming and agricultural sectors. This so-called ``free trade'' agreement has prompted hundreds of thousands of Mexicans to look for an escape from their worsening destitute circumstances to the U.S., and in doing so they risk their lives, the unity of their families and their futures. 
   U.S. trade policy upsets more than just our immigration crisis. Our faltering trade policy has also contributed to the global environmental emergency. When the Bush Administration entered into CAFTA, they did so with countries which rarely enforce their already limited environmental policies. Many of my constituents have already contacted me about the devastating environmental consequences of the Peru Free Trade Agreement. How can Congress fight global warming in the U.S. while allowing our trade rivals to destroy the rain forests and retain lax emissions standards? We must use trade as a tool to protect the environment, not to pillage it. 
   Lopsided flawed trade agreements weaken our economy. Since NAFTA's passage, over one million U.S. jobs were sucked into Mexico. Because of PNTR, more than 1.5 million jobs shipped out to China. After two centuries of trade surpluses, NAFTA ushered in an era of soaring trade deficits, even after proponents promised us bigger surpluses. 
   More recently, President Bush's trade policy in particular has caused more damage to our trade accounts. The trade deficit has climbed to record numbers each year since he took office in 2001. From $362 billion his first year to a whopping $763.6 billion last year, this President has been selling the U.S. to the highest foreign bidders. 
   Our constituents are calling Congress to action. Without the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, Congress cannot effectively respond to these crises. 
   Congress must stand for free trade among free people, and ensure that all Americans have access to middle class jobs at middle class wages with health and retirement benefits that cannot be rescinded. We must oppose Fast Track, reclaim our negotiating authority from the executive branch, and answer the pleas of the American people.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further on that point, recently, about a week ago, Hershey Chocolate announced it was going to move its operations out of Pennsylvania to Mexico. They have already been testing those Hershey Kisses, those big ones they are making down there now and the taste has changed. I am thinking, where is the old Hershey bar that used to taste so good? 
   You look at all the jobs in Pennsylvania associated with all the dairying that goes on and then the processing. They say that they are going to save the tourist center, but it won't be real any more, because the jobs won't be there, both in the plant itself and in the countryside that provides the raw product into Hershey. 
   So you ask, why are we allowing ourselves to be hollowed out like this? Wall Street is really in a pitched battle with Main Street across this country, and we have to fight here to save those middle-class jobs.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   With this resolution, Congress puts the Bush administration on notice we take the first step toward a course correction in Iraq that the American people voted last November. 
   We also put the leaders of Iraq on notice that our troop strength there will be redeploying, not escalating. 
   This House cannot stand by and expect our courageous troops to win the war against terrorism militarily while the Commander in Chief loses it strategically and ideologically. 
   Some have said passage will make bin Laden smile. They are mistaken. He is already smiling due to the devolving chaos in Iraq. He is achieving exactly what he set out to do: forcing us to destroy a nation to save it, while embroiling our military in an unending Islamic civil war of attrition that produces more terrorism and anger toward America. 
   Our mission in Iraq is struggling, but it is not due to a shortage of supplies or a lack of will or poorly trained forces. To the contrary, we have the best military in the world, with every dollar appropriated by this very House. 
   Our mission is faltering because the President misjudged the field of battle. Our troops are poised against a borderless political movement determined to mobilize downtrodden people. 
   That idea emboldens its adherence to confront the largest military force in the world. That idea enlists the weak to confront the powerful. It pits puritanical religious followers against kingdoms, against the superrich, and against corrupt regimes they deem to be unfaithful. And in Iraq it propels Sunni against Shia. 
   Despite the heroic efforts of our troops, the paradox is that the war in Iraq cannot be won in Iraq. Indeed, the war in Iraq becomes counterproductive in winning the war of ideas across the region. 
   We cannot ask our troops to bear the burden of winning a ground war when the President's policies have lost the idea war. 
   We know the truth. There were no chemical labs, as pictured here, when Secretary Powell laid out the case against Iraq before the U.N. and said there were chemical labs in Iraq. There were no such chemical labs. There was no yellow cake uranium from Niger, and there were no weapons of mass destruction. 
   We cannot ask our troops to win military victory when the administration's reason for invasion were falsehoods and debased our Nation throughout the world. 
   The intelligence was not faulty. No one should be allowed to blame this on the Central Intelligence Agency. Our intelligence community, including the CIA, tried to tell President Bush and Vice President Cheney, but they refused to listen. 
   Madam Speaker, though I voted for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, I spoke out strongly against the resolution authorizing President Bush to wage preemptive war against Iraq because I feared what would happen:  more terrorism, not less; more instability, not less. 
   Since that vote I have supported our troops at every turn and will continue to support them. And I do not regret my vote against the war in Iraq, and I do not apologize for my support of our troops. But now is the time to take the first step toward course correction to redeploy them more effectively. 
   The roots of terrorism did not spring from Iraq. Terrorism sprang from diplomatic and political failures in undemocratic states, from an Afghanistan that was let fester after the Soviet defeat. Terrorism springs from an Iran whose Shia majority our Nation has isolated for the last quarter century and tried to throttle for the prior quarter century. 
   Terrorism springs from Saudi families who pay to promote the most radical form of Islam in other nations to hold onto power in their homeland, one of the most undemocratic places on Earth. Terrorism springs from the unaddressed Israeli-Palestinian standoff. Terrorism springs from a Lebanon where the Shia majority has been underrepresented in the institutions of government. 
   Terrorism springs from a view, fair or not, that the United States allies with the rich but not the poor across the undemocratic Islamic world. How can America stand for democracy in Iraq but not in all of the oil kingdoms and theocracies to which this Nation has been unfortunately tethered for our entire adult lifetimes? 
   How can we ask our troops to bear the brunt of war in the most oil rich region of the world when we have refused to become energy independent here at home? 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot ask our troops to bear the burden of war when real diplomacy has been absent and political coalitions for victory are missing in action. In the end, war is the breakdown of diplomacy. 
   Now is the time for a course correction: redeloyment of U.S. forces, benchmarks to measure strategic achievements, diplomatic alternatives such as a soft partition of Iraq enforced by the world community to quell the rising Sunni-Shia-Kurd standoff. 
   Chances are the violence in Iraq could continue for years to come. The danger now is that our actions to date exacerbate it and encourage this violence to spill over into Jordan, Turkey, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, and even Saudi Arabia. 
   This resolution begins to resurrect America's reputation among the freedom-loving nations of world. America has always been a nation that believes in containment, not preemption. We have always known defense, not offense, is the best war strategy. We have always been strong enough to ferret out, wait out, outsmart, and counterweight the enemy. 
   3,117 U.S. dead; 23,000 injured; hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead; the rejection of the world community. These facts should lead us to face a future of a new possibility. 
   This resolution opens that door. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (MORPHING CAMPAIGN FINANCE, GOVERNANCE, AND PERSONAL AGGRANDIZEMENT IN A TANGLED WEB -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, while the U.S. economy retrenches, the front page of the Wall Street Journal today reports that former President Bill Clinton could ``get a $20 million payout from a politically sensitive partnership tie to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, made possible by his high profile business relationship with the investment firm of billionaire friend Ron Burkle. 
   The last time I looked, Dubai is not part of the United States and it is not a democracy. 
   As I read this article by John Emshwiller, I thought to myself, has any President in modern history, but for Jimmy Carter, not used the White House to cash in upon retirement? Further, has any modern President not used their White House connections to build themselves pyramid monuments upon leaving office in the form of presidential libraries where they milk their presidential contacts for millions and millions of dollars? How sad is it that former President George Bush and former President Bill Clinton took huge sums of money from foreign interests like Saudi Arabia to build their presidential libraries? Contrast this to our Nation's Founders, who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors to the cause of freedom. Now it appears all is for sale. 
   Today's story is but another example of where our Nation's highest elected officials are morphing campaign finance, governance, and their own personal aggrandizement in a tangled web. It raises to the highest levels the issue of influence peddling and what was done during those White House years to yield such super human rewards. 
   I lament the condition in which we find our national politics. Until the American people hear and understand what is happening, nothing will change. It will only worsen. Look at the disgraceful sums of money being raised by presidential candidates in both political parties and, of course, waiting in the wings the latest batch of billionaire contenders who are just ready to put their oars in the water too. 
   One of America's greatest President's was John Quincy Adams. After John Quincy Adams left the presidency, he did not immediately head out onto the lecture circuit. He did not sell his services to a rich foreign power. He did not set out to enrich himself on the fame that he had acquired by virtue of his service to the Nation. No, it was a different day and time. John Quincy Adams, after leaving the presidency, came back to Washington as a Member of this U.S. House of Representatives. To this day, he is the only President who did. He finished his life here, dying on the second floor of this Capitol. John Quincy Adams, instead of lining his own pockets, started his vaunted ``second political career'' by fighting against slave power. He made it the cause of his lifetime. 
   Just as money power dominates the national political preoccupation today, so slave power dominated political life in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. It was as deeply entrenched as the neoliberal model of international trade is today. 
   When Adams was President, Members from the Deep South had enacted a ``gag rule'' here in the People's House so that anti-slavery petitions would be summarily rejected, as if this parliamentary maneuvering could stop the discussion about slavery and the slow march to justice. 
   Professor William Lee Miller has written about John Quincy Adams's commitment to fighting slave power here in Congress, a battle that some historians have described as the ``Pearl Harbor of the slave controversy.'' John Quincy Adams refused to give up the fight until at last the Nation had heard the message of the petitioners: that slavery was inimical to the American ideal, an assault on the Constitution, and a stain on the Nation's conscience. 
   America must cleanse our political system today of the stains that even Presidents of the United States create as they enrich themselves. The Wall Street Journal article describes how Mr. Clinton is a partner of the Yucaipa Global Partnership Fund, which raised several hundred billion dollars from a range of investors. Who were these investors? How did any of them relate to the policies of the Clinton administration? These private funds do not have to disclose their activities as a normal business; so how do the American people know? 
   The director of this fund is Mr. Ron Burkle, a major fundraiser and backer of the Clintons. To mix fundraising, undisclosed business interests, and the presidency is a combustible mix. The American people have a right to know. 
   The article goes on to relate how Rudy Giuliani's consulting firm has interests in the government of Qatar. What are those interests? And how does he seek to personally benefit if elected President? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want Washington to clean up its act. As the presidential races proceed this year, isn't it high time that the campaign finance reform question be a top one in all the debates? John Quincy Adams would not recognize the Republic as it stands today.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (THE PERU TRADE DEAL -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   The Peru trade deal will also be bad for U.S. agriculture and all farmers in our country and, amazingly, in Peru. So both here at home and abroad it will result in more harm. 
   Let's look at the facts. This current trade deficit chart with Peru tells us we are already in the red with Peru, as we are in the red with China and in the red with Mexico and in the red with almost every other trading country, Japan, et cetera. The U.S. vegetable trade deficit with Peru is already a part of this. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, just the vegetable deficit component is already over $200 million in 2006. So America's vegetable farmers will lose more market share. They have already lost market share, especially those who farm asparagus, onions and peas. Their situation will be similar to the plight of America's tomato, bell pepper and cucumber farmers who learned well what happened after NAFTA was signed. They all lost production as it relocated. 
   Several global corporations have already indicated what they are going to do. They are already putting their processing plants in Peru. Green Giant has done it. Del Monte has done it. The pattern is the same, the same as under NAFTA. As was the case with Mexico where millions of peasant farmers were upended under NAFTA with no adjustment provisions for them, Peru's farmers will also be hurt when these same global corporations take over their farming operations and flood their markets with rice, corn and chicken. 
   We expect that an additional 3 million Peruvian agricultural workers will be directly affected and millions of Peruvian farmers, as Mexico's farmers well know, will be upended. This will force increased migration of those individuals to cities that are already swelling with large numbers of poor, and it is projected expanded illegal drug production as people try to stay in their home countries with no crops to sell, they turn to those illegal choices. 
   Similar to the lack of protection for Mexico's corn and bean farmers under NAFTA, which that corn and bean tariff is going to phase out at the end of this year, and another 2 million of Mexico's farmers will be hurt, we know that what happens is that they either emigrate to adjoining cities or to the United States, many of them illegally, or they turn to the illegal sector where they literally risk their lives in order to survive. 
   What kind of a plan is this that would treat the people of developing countries with such derision? What kind of a plan is it that would hurt our farmers to that extent? Why does it always have to be a negative? Why can't trade be a plus plus? Importantly, Peru was the world's top coca producer in 1996, and coca production remains a viable alternative for farmers forced to give up their legal crops. 
   Is anybody listening? Is anybody thinking? It is pretty clear what is going to happen because there is nothing in the agreement to help Peru adjust. We saw what happened when that didn't occur under NAFTA. There were no adjustment provisions for Mexico's farmers. CAFTA, the same thing, and now we add Peru on top of the pile. There is nothing in the Peruvian agreement for adjustments inside of Peru. The displaced farmers have few options. If they do not turn to coca production or other illegal industries, they will be forced to move. And we can ask where. To the overcrowded cities of Peru, further straining those resources? To another country? With the debate raging about illegal immigration and with us unable to reach a civil accommodation across this continent, wouldn't it be truly cruelly irresponsible to support another trade agreement that could result in more devastation to small holders? 
   Shouldn't we be helping these farmers adjust inside their own homelands? That is long overdue inside of Mexico, in order to help people earn money in their own countries, rather than wipe out hundreds of thousands of people as if their lives and their cultures didn't matter. And then we get the added problem of illegal labor trafficking into this country, which we can't control. 
   The Peru agreement doesn't do anything to address these serious human concerns. It does have some of the glossy language like NAFTA and CAFTA did that ends up toothless in terms of enforcement. 
   Madam Speaker, why would the American people be given more of the same out of this Congress? We ought to be changing these trade agreements to development agreements and treating people with the respect they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. With a heavy heart, I rise in opposition to this rule and the Wall Street rescue bill. Why? The key provision added over the weekend amounts to a huge elephant galloping over the American people with its blank check to Wall Street. In exchange, the American people get to cling to fool's gold--a few billion dollars to cities and States which are facing hundreds of billions of dollars of loss. Ohio alone needs the total amount of meager funds allocated to workouts. Sadly, less than one percent of the assistance in this bill is targeted to those local communities! We need a bill that strengthens each community's real estate values through Federal bond guarantees to them, not to the big investment banks and uninsured housing enterprises that caused this problem in the first place. I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.  
   INTRODUCTION
   President Franklin Roosevelt aptly gave a name to the Wall Street financial manipulators who, time and again, put our nation in enormous financial peril. He called them ``malefactors of wealth''--``malefactors,'' from the Latin ``mal'' meaning ``bad,'' and ``factor,'' meaning ``makers'' ..... makers of bad. That is, people who do great harm with the use of wealth. 
   As a scion of old wealth himself, Roosevelt knew them well. He knew the lengths to which  they would go to satisfy their cravings for more, and more, and more--as if reason and prudence didn't apply. And they did not care who they ran over in their quest. Their deeds have placed our nation at risk, time and again. Now, with the mortgage foreclosure crisis, they have done it again--this time, the damage is so huge it dwarfs the savings and loan fiasco of the 1980's when they ponzi-schemed up housing markets, saw them crash, and then ran to Congress to bail them out. Back then, the perpetrators centered their attention on California, Texas, Arizona, and the hot housing markets. Yet all Americans, from all states--like Ohio which was not one of the epicenters of their gluttony--were forced to pay the bills for their bad deeds. 
   Today, Congress will vote to burden the American people with another blank check, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars lasting three generations, to Wall Street brokerages and the shareholders of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. It is times like this that my heart feels very heavy for my fellow countrymen and women, as I cannot save us from this wrongful debt being imposed. This bailout of Wall Street giants never had a hearing in Committee. 
   Why should our people be made to pay for them? What will our communities get for this added, massive debt obligation?

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow on Mr. Hare's remarks this evening and also oppose the pending Peru Free Trade Agreement, which we think is scheduled to come up on this floor in early October. 
   My question really is: With the United States trade deficit galloping out of control, this year it is likely to hit a trillion dollars in the red, as we continue to outsource jobs across this country. Recently, Ford Mazda in Monroe, Michigan, just north of our district, announced another 2,000 to 3,000 jobs gone. Those are not counting all the supplier jobs outsourced. So why would we be considering another NAFTA-like trade agreement here in this Congress? 
   The trade deficit with Mexico after NAFTA's passage has gotten worse every single year, going deeper and deeper and deeper into debt, more of our jobs outsourced to that country. Right before NAFTA's passage, there was a positive balance and they tried to make it look good to convince Congress it is getting better. Then we fell into heavy deficit every single year. 
   We are already in deficit with Peru. In fact, every year it has been getting worse and worse and worse with that nation. So we are even in worse shape with Peru than we were with NAFTA when that was signed. Why would we want more of the same based on that trade model? 
   Now, one can ask what is happening down there that we have to do this now, with the communities across this country, some of them like my own with over 8 percent unemployment, and why should we sacrifice more U.S. jobs to these flawed trade agreements. 
   I think I put my finger on it with Peru. There is something called the Camisea Natural Gas Project. In 2004, that country started exporting through this mega gas project exports to our country and other places in the world. Two pipelines started to deliver natural gas from the Amazon River basin at that time. One of the problems with this project is the number of spills and the environmental degradation that is occurring in that region due to this pipeline. 
   With America so energy dependent, rather than using our power to become energy independent here at home, we are getting ourselves involved in these trade agreements to try to bring more and import more power to this country rather than investing those dollars here. The price of that import of power is a loss of more of our jobs. That is not a trade-off this Member is willing to make. 
   In addition to that, the Peru Trade Agreement, as we understand it, has several really terrible provisions in it. First of all, the privatization of social security. In Peru, under their system, the agreement would allow private companies like Citibank or other U.S. investors to sue Peruvian taxpayers if Peru itself tries to reverse the partial privatization of the social security system that occurred in that country in the last decade. What a terrible, terrible provision to have for the people of Peru. We believe in the integrity of our Social Security system. Why should we impact theirs? 
   In addition to that, the Peru agreement as proposed would affect the access to generic medicines to people who live in a very impoverished country like Peru where over half of the people are poor. A number of nongovernmental organizations based in the United States and Latin America have confirmed that this agreement would reduce access to essential medicines by the poor population of Peru and that the agreement's provisions far exceed international standards established by the WTO. Why would we want to do that to the people of Peru? 
   Moving on to food safety, why would we want to harm the people of our country, because the agreement does not address serious food safety issues that currently plague our relationship with Peru. Indeed, it is one of the 20 top exporters of shrimp to the United States market, and FDA inspectors have consistently rejected seafood from Peru for numerous reasons, including filth, adulteration, misbranding, and presence of various dangerous food pathogens. 
   There has been poisonous swordfish, salmonella in shrimp, dangerous histamines in mahi-mahi. Shipment after shipment of dried, canned, frozen and fresh fish products from Peru have proven to be damaged. Why would we want to encourage more of that? 
   Let me also say one of my concerns about this Peru agreement, as with Mexico, it has no adjustment policies for the poorest of the poor. In other words, the Peru Free Trade Agreement does not take into account many farmers in Peru who are going to be displaced because, as other First World agricultural products flood in there, there are no provisions in the agreement to take care of the poor farmers who will be displaced. Why would we do this to our continent? 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many other reasons to oppose the Peru Free Trade Agreement which I will put in the Record and come to the floor in future days to discuss.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to place in the Record remarks that I made in 1999 regarding a measure called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill that passed in this Congress on a vote of 362-57. At the time we said it would cause the mess we're facing today on Wall Street and indeed it has. 
   I will place also in the Record the votes of those who were present voting ``yes'' and voting ``no.'' 
   This is an extraordinarily important vote that essentially unharnessed Wall Street to do whatever it wanted, mixing banking, commerce, real estate, insurance in a way America had not done for over half a century. 
   Some of what I said at that time was, ``I would say to the people listening tonight, are you tired of calling banks and getting lost in the automated phone system, never locating a breathing human being? This bill will make it worse. 
   ``Are you fed up with rising ATM fees and service fees that now average over $200 a year per account holder? This bill will make it worse. 
   ``Are you tired of mega-financial conglomerates and mergers that have made your community a branch economy of financial centers located far away whose officers you never know who never come to your community? This bill will make it worse.'' 
   I would urge my colleagues to take a look at the remarks that were made over a decade ago and think about what we are facing today. I commend all of my colleagues who voted ``no'' in those days. They deserve a badge of honor.

   Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and in opposition, strong opposition, to the bill. This bill is pro megabank and it is against consumers. 
   And I would say to the people listening tonight, Are you tired of calling banks and getting lost in the automated phone system, never locating a breathing human being? This bill will make it worse. 
   Are you fed up with rising ATM fees and service fees that now average over $200 a year per account holder? This bill will make it worse. 
   Are you skeptical about banks that used to be dedicated to safety and soundness and savings but are now switching to pushing stocks and insurance and debt? This bill will make it worse. 
   Are you tired of the megafinancial conglomerates and mergers that have made your community a branch economy of financial centers located far away, whose officers you never know, who never come to your community? This bill will make it worse. 
   Punitive reporting requirements in this bill are aimed at disabling community groups that are the only groups in this country that hold these institutions accountable for the depositors' money. It is going to make them a target of Federal reporting requirements. So why do community groups oppose this bill, like the Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, the Fair Housing Alliance, the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, the Coalition of Community Development Financial Institutions, Consumers Union, the Volunteers of America? Sounds like the folks that live in my neighborhood, my colleagues. 
   I would say this is one of the worst conceived bills ever to come before this body, simply because it does not pay attention to the majority of the American people who have, on average, less than $2,000 in any financial institution in this country. To anyone listening tonight I say, Put your money in the credit unions. They are owned by you and they will take care of you. Vote against this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. KAPTUR. (REAL REFORM, OR NOTHING -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I have some advice for President Bush and Secretary Paulson, and that is--hold your horses. The Wall Street credit crunch is not the fault of the American taxpayer. In fact, 94 percent of the American people are paying their mortgages on time. 
   The credit crunch has been created by an unregulated global financial market with some pretty important players. They sure have a lot more money than our family does. This mess extends far beyond Wall Street. The co-conspirators include the central banks in China, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Japan. These institutions all around the world who fully understood they were buying pieces of paper held by people who lacked the ability to pay, but they wanted access to our markets to sell their goods, and they bought our debt securities to assure our government wouldn't stand tall for fair trade. 
   They played a form of financial musical chairs, so to speak, hoping that when the music stopped, they would not be penalized. Well, the music has stopped, and they don't want to pay the penalty. They want a bailout. 
   The American people for two decades have opposed the NAFTA-type trade deals that these financial houses have supported that have caused so many catastrophic losses of jobs as industries were outsourced, communities devastated, and our national wealth harmed. The American people are not to blame for that. They're frustrated with that. 
   Rather, it is the stewards in these financial houses, the folks over in this Bush administration, that want to extend NAFTA to Colombia now and the Federal Reserve and Treasury who fail to do their fiduciary duties. 
   You know, there's a lot of history here. 
   If we think about where the seeds were planted that caused this mess in the markets, you can go back to 1989 with the passage by this Congress of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. I voted ``no'' on that bill because what it did was it placed all of these troubled savings and loans back then that had bad paper right on the books of the American taxpayer. We paid over $250 billion for all of those mistakes, and that bill established a Resolution Trust Corporation which executed a lot of very lucrative deals to dispose of those failed thrifts, including one called in the consolidation, post-RTC, Superior Bank, which, by 2001, after getting all of the tax breaks that it got, ended up getting the largest fine in American history ever imposed by the FDIC: $450 million for its wrongdoing. 
   That particular Act in 1989 also diminished the role of community savings banks that had been so important in our country. That Act also took the regulatory harness off the Wall Street high-steppers, and they began to get very, very careless. 
   The RTC savings and loan failures ultimately have cost the American people so much that we're still paying interest on the messes from the 1980s. Now they want to add more. 
   Then in 1994, Congress passed--and I voted against--the Interstate Banking Act that basically allowed these financial institutions to get even bigger and less community-oriented. Give us no money on our passbook savings and charge us fees just if we have money in checking accounts. They have made billions. 
   I remember in 1995 when Speaker Newt Gingrich was elected, and he went down to the Banking Committee and took the name off the door. It used to be Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, and he changed it to Financial Services; and oh, boy, have they been about doing that, putting fees on everything, practically even breathing when you walk in a bank. 
   So the whole idea of prudent banking was thrown out the window, and the time-honored principles of character, collateral, and collectibility were thrown out. 
   Then in 1999 the killer bill of all, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, was passed by this Congress, and it gutted the Glass-Steagall Act that had been there since the Great Depression. That Act passed this Congress by a margin of 362-57, and that repeal enabled commercial lenders like Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by assets, to underwrite and trade instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations in the international market for the first time in American history. 
   The repeal of that Act is one of the major contributing factors to the subprime mortgage crisis that we face. Nontransparent practices like derivatives crept in, and it was even hard to define what a bank was anymore as loans were then changed to be bonds and then bonds became securitized debt and then securitized debt was sold into the international market. And who in the world even knows where your mortgage lies.     
   Today, we have, as a Congress, the duty to reform the system, prosecute those responsible, and protect our taxpayers. 
   Mr. Speaker, might I just say, in closing, America doesn't need $700 billion for Wall Street. We need 500 more lawyers and accountants at the FBI going after these people, not as a symbolic force, but as a real force, to go after and recover the money from all the mansions, Mercedes, boats, stock options, and offshore tax havens that these people have set in place. 
   This is a problem that this Congress has to solve. Please support my bills, H.R. 6990 and H.R. 1452, to set America on a more prudent and diligent course in our banking and financial system.

   Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Since you mentioned the State of Ohio, I thought I should just state for the record that the vast numbers of people in our State do not favor the extension of NAFTA to Colombia. Indeed, the entire Catholic and Christian communities as well or other organized against this agreement because of the horrendous treatment of Afro-Colombians on the northwestern side of Colombia, as well as the massive killing of labor leaders, the largest number in the world, more than all other countries, combined. So we place human life first, and I just wanted to thank the gentleman, but I don't think you should use the State of Ohio in your argument about Colombia trade. I thank you for yielding to me.
