<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PASSAGE OF THE HOUSING BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to acknowledge the bipartisan work of this Congress and the Bush administration on the housing bill that the House passed yesterday. This legislation is in the best interests of the American people, and it was the product of honest negotiation and compromise between the administration and this Congress. 
   At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I had hoped that this type of work between the legislative and the executive branches would take place regularly. Unfortunately, it has been a rare occurrence. I'm optimistic that the next administration will be prepared to put forth ideas and to work collaboratively with the Congress instead of resorting to tired rhetoric and dragging their feet on policies that are supported by Americans. 
   I'm glad that we had a positive breakthrough and bipartisan negotiations with this important housing bill. It will provide needed assistance to homeowners, to communities, and Main streets across the Nation. And I look forward to the Senate's swift passage of this legislation to enhance the economic future of the United States.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3087, and I thank my colleagues, all of you, for getting it here to the floor. I voted for this bill in the Armed Services Committee with bipartisan support. It passed 55-2, and I think this is the beginning of the way. I'm happy that we're trying to find a way to move in Iraq. 
   We are here today because after more than 4 years of the President's war, it has become painfully clear that the administration didn't adequately plan for this war. Plan. Planning. And this is what this bill is about. And that the administration really didn't understand the substantial investment that it was going to take for American troops beyond the initial invasion. In fact, when the President declared ``Mission Accomplished'' on May 1, 2003, we had only lost 139 of our troops in Iraq; however, since then, 3,660 of our troops have been lost. So the American people have called for a redeploying of our troops from Iraq, and we need to start doing it, and we need a plan to do that redeployment. 
   So today, with this legislation, Congress is mandating that proper planning be done, so that whenever the redeployment begins, our troops will be brought home safely to their families.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. Madam Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. 
   Under the previous majority, Congress was quick to provide tax cuts for large corporations, but legislation to improve the lives of working families was kept off the floor of this chamber. 
   Labor unions are responsible for almost every benefit to wage earners in this country: 
   Unions created the 40 hour work week, overtime pay, maternity leave, and worker's compensation. 
   Unions represent the people that make our country work--The grape harvesters, the home builders, telecommunications workers, ice cream scoopers at the SavOn Drug store in Anaheim. When I had that job, I was represented by Local 324 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, and proud of it. 
   In every sector of the economy, laborers have always looked to their unions to make sure that their interests were put ahead of the interest in the bottom line. 
   And it's about time Congress do the same. 
   Opponents of this legislation will claim that this bill is undemocratic. But how democratic is it for an employer to intimidate or fire workers before they even get a chance to vote? 
   Let's look at the numbers: 75 percent of employers will hire union-busters to stop organizing drives. 92 percent will mandate employees to attend anti-union meetings, and one quarter of companies illegally fire pro-union employees during organizing drives. How can you have a ``free and fair vote'' with this kind of intimidation going on? 
   All this bill does is level the playing field. It removes institutional barriers and gives workers a chance to organize if they want to. 
   You know, government is actually behind the private sector on this issue. Many employers already allow for this type of organization. They recognize that it is good for workers, and it's good for management too. These leading companies have seen growing job satisfaction, better retention of qualified professionals and increased productivity. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge Congress to do the right thing. Let's pass this legislation and give employees a real opportunity to organize.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, June 14, the Orange County Water District will celebrate its 75th anniversary. Along with the other members of the Orange County delegation, I introduced House Resolution 1199 to honor this significant occasion. 
   The Orange County Water District's 75th anniversary is particularly meaningful as it comes just months after we opened up the largest groundwater treatment replenishment system in the Nation on January 10, 2007. The replenishment system is on the cutting edge of water reuse technology. It will purify 70 million gallons of water a day, providing clean water to over 100,000 families in Orange County. 
   The vision and the initiative by the District in establishing the groundwater replenishment system is the reason it received the 2008 Clair A. Hill Award and was named the Public Water Agency of the Year in 2008. 
   The District is a leader in identifying and creating new and exciting options to meet the water needs of California, of the Nation and of the world, and I hope that this resolution will make its way to this House quickly.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, our country is facing a severe shortage of registered nurses. The situation is well-documented. The Journal of the American Medical Association has stated that, without changes, the United States will have a shortage of more than 400,000 nurses by the year 2020. To date, there has been limited government action to address this very national need. 
   Effective health care delivery relies on an adequate supply of well-educated health care professionals, so this week I introduced H.R. 2572, the Nurse Loan Forgiveness Act of 2007, to expand the supply and to help provide for the education of registered nurses, because nurses play a principal role in the health care delivery system in various settings, in hospitals, in home health agencies, in long-term care facilities, managed care centers and community health clinics. 
   The Nurse Loan Forgiveness Act would forgive up to $17,000 in Federal loans over a 5-year period for people who have worked in a hospital at least 1 year. If they continue to work, they would be able to, over time, have that entire amount forgiven. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Congress has the ability to take action on this critical issue, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this very important legislation.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for passage of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. The scientific community has demonstrated the great potential for stem cell research. Advancements are being made through the National Institute of Health, private sector biotechnology, and research universities. 
   Some of that progress has been made with stem cells from other than embryonic sources, but the Congress should not be in the business of shackling scientific discovery and should pass this legislation to open up the potential that embryonic stem cell research has to offer. In Orange County, California, the University of California at Irvine, Reeve Research Center is home to spectacular research that is utilizing embryonic stem cells to develop treatments for spinal-cord injuries and neurological disorders. 
   California has already led the way for responsible government support of stem cell research. Now is the time for the Federal government to do so as well. I urge my colleagues to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 1281, the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Act of 2007. 
   This is an issue that is close to my heart. I am grateful to my colleagues Mr. EMANUEL, for introducing this legislation, and Chairman CONYERS, for his consideration or H.R. 1281 in the Judiciary Committee. 
   The great promise of America is that every citizen has a vote, a voice in how our government is run. And we've seen in recent years where 100 or 50 or 5 or even 1 vote has changed the outcome of an election. So making sure that every U.S. citizen is able to vote is one of our most fundamental responsibilities. 
   When most people think of Voting Rights Act violations they thing of the 1960s, when African Americans were prevented from voting because of the color of their skin. Many do not realize that voter suppression still occurs today. 
   The targets of intimidation remain the same. This last election, minority and naturalized immigrant communities were the targets of deception, misinformation and voter intimidation designed to abridge their right to vote. 
   In the district I represent, California's 47th, concerns were raised when about 14,000 registered Hispanic voters received a written letter, in Spanish, from the ``California Coalition for Immigration Reform'' informing voters that immigrants voting in a federal election were committing a crime ``that could result in incarceration and possible deportation.....'' 
   It also went on to advise voters that ``the U.S. government is installing a new computerized system to verify names of all the newly registered voters who participate in the elections in October and November. Organizations against immigration will be able to request information from this new computerized system.'' 
   The intent of the letter was to intimidate. Families were afraid that their personal information would be shared with anti-immigration groups if they voted. They were afraid of retaliation for exercising their right to vote. 
   Revisiting and reforming the voting rights laws will send a clear message to potential violators that deceptive practices are unacceptable and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 
   H.R. 1281 will strengthen the prohibition and punishment of deceptive practices that aim to keep voters away from the polls on Election Day. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will go a long way in preventing future acts of voter intimidation.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LUCIANO PAVAROTTI -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank my good friend from New York. 
   I am pleased that today the House of Representatives is considering House Resolution 708, honoring the life and accomplishments of Luciano Pavarotti. As the sponsor of this legislation, I would like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, especially the chairman, Mr. Lantos, for his assistance in  bringing this before the end of the year, the year 2007, the year in which Mr. Pavarotti died. 
   He was born on October 12, 1935, and he died on September 6, 2007, in Modena, Italy. I know, because I was in the Veneto that day when his death was announced by his family. And during his life, Mr. Pavarotti shared his incredible talent and passion for opera with the entire world. During his life, he actually began as a second grade teacher before he decided to turn to his pursuit of music full time. After devoting himself to serious voice training for over 7 years, Mr. Pavarotti made his operatic debut in the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's ``La Boheme.'' 
   From that initial performance, Pavarotti continued to follow his dream of performing opera around the world. And after many years of hard work, of course, he became really one of opera's premier performers. But in addition to his incredible voice and his talent on stage; Mr. Pavarotti made frequent television performances, and as a result he really opened up the world of opera to a whole new audience. Mr. Pavarotti, with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, entered into one of the most famous collaborations in music, and The Three Tenors continued to bring opera music to more and more people around the world. As an established opera star, he decided to use his talent and his connections to benefit charities, and he began hosting the annual Pavarotti and Amici, or Pavarotti and Friends, concerts in Modena, Italy, to raise money for worthy United Nations causes. 
   Mr. Pavarotti's appeal to opportunities, he got an opportunity to see things that are rarely enjoyed by most of us. He earned five Grammy Awards and a Grammy Legend Award, and he became the first and so far the only opera singer to perform on ``Saturday Night Live.'' Mr. Pavarotti also received numerous honors for his charitable work including being named the United Nations' Messenger of Peace and receiving the Nansen Medal from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in honor of his efforts to raise money on behalf of refugees around the world. 
   Mr. Pavarotti's career is an inspiration to aspiring young artists around the world, and it encourages them to continue to go after their dream. In addition, Mr. Pavarotti's commitment to charitable causes provides an important example of how artists can raise awareness in funding for people in need. 
   Mr. Speaker, since his death, the world has missed his talent and his passion. And although we will always have recordings of his beautiful music, we will continue to miss his presence and his love for life. And I know that in the last 10 years of his life he filled his life and was very fulfilled. But we should remember that Mr. Pavarotti once said: ``A life in music is a life beautifully spent, and this is what I have devoted my life to.'' 
   Mr. Pavarotti's life was indeed a life beautifully spent, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 708 to honor his life and his achievements.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6869, the Border Security Search Accountability Act of 2008, which I introduced into the House last week. This bill establishes strict guidelines for Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement's electronic device seizure policy. 
   It is important to ensure that Customs and Border agents have the tools necessary to go after potential terrorists. This bill allows for the appropriate search, review, retention and sharing of information on an individual's electronic device, as necessary for security purposes. 
   H.R. 6869 also ensures that when an individual's property is seized at a point of entry, there is a well-defined procedure in place that will protect their privacy and electronic data, especially the doctor-patient and attorney-client privileges. This legislation also requires the Department of Homeland Security to post information about individual rights related to border searches in visible areas near the search points so that individuals will understand their rights.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush vetoed a plan to fund our troops and to change the direction in Iraq. Following his veto, the House voted for the fourth time in 3 months for a new direction in Iraq and rejected the President's open-ended commitment. 
   Unfortunately, House Republicans have refused to join us in our attempts to change the course of the war. Republican Leader Boehner said over the weekend that he wants a clean bill. What he is really saying is that he wants us to rubber-stamp the President's war proposal. That's what Republican Congresses have been doing for 4 years, and it hasn't helped our military and it hasn't made America safer. 
   When are House Republicans going to realize that the American people overwhelmingly support benchmarks and a real plan to change direction in Iraq? One encouraging sign was when Leader Boehner said this weekend that he would be willing to look at a plan B in September. Does that mean that House Republicans will finally begin to join us in changing the course of the war in Iraq? We'll have to wait and see.

   I understand that, when President Bush and Prime Minister Dung met, they discussed the importance of promoting human rights in Vietnam and that Prime Minister Dung told President Bush that the Vietnamese Government has made efforts and is committed to further promoting and improving human rights in Vietnam. 
   Now, as a long-time advocate of human rights in Vietnam and as a representative of one of the largest Vietnamese-American communities, we know that human rights in Vietnam have only been getting worse. The Government of Vietnam has continued to harass, arrest and to sentence peaceful democracy advocates to prison--oh, and by the way, also United States citizens of Vietnamese descent. 
   If there is any evidence of Prime Minister Dung's claim that human  rights in Vietnam are improving, I urge him to show it to this Congress, but I doubt that he is telling the truth.

   If this legislation is not passed into law, millions of Americans will no longer be able to visit their physicians and receive the regular quality care that they rely on. I understand that some Members of the Congress have concerns about the pay-for in this legislation. However, this Congress and this government cannot continue to pass the buck on fiscal responsibility whenever we are faced with difficult choices.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today  the House of Representatives is considering House Resolution 1199, which honors the 75th anniversary of the Orange County Water District. 
   As a sponsor of this legislation, I would like to thank the Committee on Natural Resources, especially the gentleman from West Virginia, Chairman Rahall, for his assistance in bringing this resolution to the floor, and my good friend from Guam for managing this resolution. I also would like to thank the rest of my colleagues from Orange County, all of whom are original cosponsors of this resolution. 
   You see, this Water District, the Orange County Water District, began its operations in 1933 when then California Governor James Rolph, Jr. signed it into existence on June 14. At that time, the Water District covered more than 163,000 acres and was intended to serve about 60,000 people primarily in agriculture. That is the beginning of Orange County. But today, the Orange County Water District covers well over 200,000 acres, and it serves a population of more than 2.3 million people. 
   As it has grown, the Water District has stayed on top of its game at the forefront of efforts with respect to water supply and the efficient distribution of that through Orange County. And the best example of that, of course, is what we just opened in January of this year, and that is our groundwater replenishment system. 
   The replenishment system is on the cutting edge of water reuse technology. It will purify 70 million gallons of water a day to provide clean drinking water for more than 100,000 Orange County families. 
   This system is the premier groundwater replenishment project in the world. And Orange County is often visited by other people from our country and from dignitaries from around the world, scientists from around the world, engineers from around the world, who want to come and see what we are doing. And yes, basically what we're doing is that we dispose of the water by flushing the toilet, send it into a tertiary process, clean it purer than the water you would find in the ground. We put it into the ground, and about 3 or 4 years later the same water is being used through your house once again. This makes it self-contained. It means that in a desert like southern California, we are not importing water for our usage, we're actually using our own water over and over, and this is the wave of the future. As I said, so many from around the world, from Israel and from other places, are coming to take a look at what we have done. And even just recently, the Mayor of Los Angeles said he would like to try to make a system like that work in the County of Los Angeles. 
   So the Orange County Water District's vision and initiative in establishing this system is the reason that it received the 2008 Clair A. Hill Award from the Association of California Water Agencies, and it was also named the Public Water Agency of the Year in 2008. 
   Throughout its 75-year history, the Orange County Water District has proven that it is a leader in identifying and creating new and existing options to meet the water needs of California, of our Nation, and of the world. Along with the entire county delegation, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote for this resolution today.

   Sister McNerney's dedication to the youth of Santa Ana continues in her retirement, as she is encouraging Taller San Jose to find someone new, new leadership to infuse that leadership into that group. 
   She is an extraordinary example of community leadership. She is a friend, and I thank her for her years of service to our community.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   I reluctantly rise today to express concerns about the current economic crisis and the proposed financial recovery package. 
   For several years I ave been concerned about the road our economy was heading down. 
   In June 2005 at a Joint Economic Committee hearing I asked then Federal Reserve Chairman Allen Greenspan about the dangers of the housing bubble. 
   And he responded that there was no ``substantial'' threat of a housing bubble and that even if home prices were to decline they were ``not likely to have substantial macroeconomic implications.'' 
   Unfortunately, he was wrong. 
   If the severity of the financial situation had been acted on back in 2005, or even 1 year ago, I think we would be in a better situation today. 
   However, instead of pro actively addressing this brewing financial crisis, as recently as April 2008 the goal of this Administration was to reduce regulation with the expectation that ``market-discipline'' will be the ultimate regulator. 
   Well, we have learned that there is no ``market-discipline'' without regulation and without  the threat that people and I companies will have to pay for the mistakes they made. 
   And so today we are considering a financial recovery package to save the financial industry from its mistakes, a package that is paid for with tax dollars earned by hardworking Americans. 
   My constituents in Orange County, CA, are asking me: Where was the Government to save my house from foreclosure last year? Where was the Government to save my neighborhood when half the houses on my block were foreclosed on? 
   Unfortunately the Government was not there to help my constituents and the millions of Americans that have lost their homes. 
   Since the Bush administration requested a $700 billion blank check from Congress and the American people, our leadership in Congress has worked very hard to negotiate a more responsible package. 
   The recovery package on the floor reflects a big improvement over the original Bush-Paulson plan. 
   I am pleased that this package includes safeguards to protect any taxpayer investment in saving the financial industry. 
   These safeguards include: 
   Warrants from financial institutions that receive assistance so the Government can recover the taxpayers' money once the financial industry recovers; an insurance program funded by the financial industry to guarantee troubled assets and protect taxpayers; and a plan to charge the financial industry fees to recoup the taxpayers' investment if there are still losses after 5 years. 
   However, this package does not do enough to help the average American keep their home, and to ensure that the Wall Street executives that got us into this mess don't walk away with millions of dollars.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill. As you know, I chair the Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee, and I have been working on port security issues for many years, and I was extensively involved in the SAFE Port Act that was signed into law last year. 
   One important provision of the SAFE Port Act was the requirement that the Coast Guard implement a long-range vessel tracking system. More than 60,000 vessels traverse the world's oceans annually, and more than 8,000 deep-draft vessels call on United States ports every year. 
   Implementation of a long-range vessel tracking system is critical to ensure that maritime operations are conducted in a way that keeps our Nation safe and secure. In addition, it will make international commerce more efficient for our Nation's port operators. 
   Chairman Price, while your bill does not allocate a specific amount of funding for the implementation of the required long-range vessel tracking system, I have noted that there is a funding stream of $40 million for activities mandated by the SAFE Port law, and I want to clarify your support for the implementation of the long-range vessel tracking system required in the  SAFE Port law and that part of the $40 million in funding could be used towards meeting that mandate.

   Over the first 10 years of its existence, from 1994 to 2005, the COPS hiring grant programs have helped local law enforcement agencies hire 117,000 additional police officers. As a result there have been significant drops in the crime rates across our Nation. Unfortunately the previous Congress drastically reduced and then eliminated funding for the COPS hiring grants in the 2005 and 2006 funding cycles. 
   H.R. 1700 will reinvigorate the COPS program by authorizing $600 million a year for hiring grants. This level of funding will help put an additional 50,000 police officers in our communities over the next 6 years. I am proud that this Congress is acting to restore funding for these hiring grants that are so critical to local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
   In addition, this legislation will authorize $350 million for COPS technology grants. These grants will help local law enforcement agencies buy critical technology like computers for patrol cars and crime mapping software. I have seen this type of crime mapping software at work in the city of Santa Ana, California, in my district. This technology acts as a force multiplier, allowing each officer to be more effective in fighting crime and keeping our communities safe. 
   H.R. 1700 also authorizes $200 million for programs that focus on hiring the community prosecutors that play a critical role in following up on police work and convicting criminals. 
   All of these COPS grant programs will provide critical resources to local law enforcement agencies across the country that are facing a variety of challenges including emerging and ongoing gang activity. In previous years, a COPS grant provided funding to the Santa Ana Police Department for Firearms Identification technology that can read the unique fingerprints that connect bullets and guns. The Santa Ana Police Department has been able to solve many gang-related shootings and other violent crimes by using this ballistics technology. I hope that the passage of this legislation will help ensure that law enforcement agencies across the nation benefit from the valuable COPS grant programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1700.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (HOUSE DEMOCRATS ADDRESS HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, the Children's Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP, was created as a partnership between the States and the Federal Government to ensure that more children would have access to health insurance. Over the last decade, it has been received as a strong, bipartisan effort. 
   The success of the program is not questioned. Thanks to CHIP, the number of uninsured children has decreased every year for the last decade, except for this past year when the number of children actually increased. 
   This week, the House will vote on the CHAMP Act, a bill that strengthens the Children's Health Program so that it reaches nearly all of the children that are eligible for the program. Currently, CHIP reaches 6 million, but there are 6 million kids that aren't insured yet. 
   Today, there is simply not enough funding to enroll more children. But that is going to change this week,  when the House adds on an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years to the CHIP program. That will ensure that an additional 5 million children are insured. 
   Let's once again act in a bipartisan fashion this week and pass the CHAMP Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, was before us at the Joint Economic Committee. Chairman Bernanke noted many negative factors for the current economy, increased unemployment claims, increased food and energy prices, and it has reduced Americans' confidence in the economy. 
   Recently, we have all seen news reports about the Federal Reserve's unprecedented actions aimed at increasing liquidity, stabilizing credit markets, and protecting a Wall Street investment bank from bankruptcy. Despite these dramatic measures, liquidity remains limited, and with only news reports to go on, the American public seems unsure about whether government is acting in their best interest. 
   The Federal Reserve needs to start clearly informing the American public about the impact of its actions. This openness would encourage sensible economic policy, bring stability to the markets, and help restore individuals' confidence in the government and in our economy. 
   Millions of homeowners are struggling to make mortgage payments or have already lost their homes, and they do not feel like their government is helping them. The Federal Reserve needs to clearly communicate better to the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring urgent attention to the deteriorating human rights conditions in the country of Vietnam. 
   Most recently, Vietnamese students and bloggers have been harassed and detained for peacefully voicing their concerns about the Vietnamese government's policies. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Government of Vietnam is not living up to its commitment to honor and to protect human rights. 
   This month, over 3,000 Vietnamese Catholics were harassed by Hanoi's police with tear gas, electric batons and other repressive measures while attending a peaceful Thai Ha prayer vigil. We are continuing to see more and more activists being detained and imprisoned for exercising their freedom of speech, religion and expression, rights that are guaranteed under the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights.  
   This week, I, along with six other Members, sent a letter to President Nguyen Minh Triet to express outrage over Vietnam's ongoing human rights violations, and to urge the Government of Vietnam to stop using violence against its own people. 
   I encourage my colleagues to continue addressing this serious issue and speaking out for those in Vietnam who are putting their lives in danger in the name of freedom.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank the kind chairman for not only allowing me to speak on this, but also for all the work that you've done to put this together. 
   I rise today in support of the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. 
   A lack of action by the previous Republican-led Congresses and policies of the Bush Administration have led to skyrocketing gas prices while Big Oil companies are earning their largest profits in American history. We need to act now. We need to pass a balanced energy bill, which is exactly what H.R. 6899 is. 
   Many Americans are facing financial hardship because of our country's energy struggles. This bill expands domestic drilling, it protects States' rights to maintain control over their shores, and it allows America to move towards the future by investing in new sources of energy. 
   Despite some of the speeches we have heard on the floor today, the American people and the States are not unanimously in favor of an offshore drilling free-for-all. 
   The looming expiration of the offshore drilling ban on September 30 would allow drilling as close as three miles offshore in my home State of California. That's very concerning for Californians who are committed to protecting our shores from any drilling. And I support their sentiment. 
   This bill provides a compromise, ensuring that States like California can opt out of offshore drilling. Quite frankly, it seems like those people who would be for States' rights would support this provision that ensures that States are involved in the decision of whether to drill between 50 and 100 miles off of their shores. 
   In addition, the remaining Outer Continental Shelf beyond the 100 miles would be open to oil and gas leasing. As you might imagine, that doesn't thrill Californians, but this is a compromise; it's a compromise that gives States control over the waters closest to them while also advancing the Federal drilling interests further offshore. 
   In addition to the drilling provision, this bill will help enhance our national security and move toward energy independence by investing in renewable sources of energy. This legislation expands and extends tax incentives for renewable electricity, energy such as solar and wind and plug-in hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes and buildings and appliances. 
   I urge everybody to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This intelligent bill increases Federal scholarship amounts and loan limits to provide students with additional assistance in paying for college, and to help them rely less on costlier private loans. 
   In fact, when I went to school, college, 25 years ago, college tuition at my university was $8,000 a year, and my Pell Grant was $2,700 a year. Today, that very school costs $38,000 a year, and the Pell Grant is $4,100 a year. We need to do something about this situation. 
   As part of this legislation, I am pleased to see that the Congress is moving to enact $5,000 of Federal student loan forgiveness for students who are using the education they receive to serve their community and country in areas of national need. 
   Loan forgiveness provides a powerful message to a student: Your Government will help you if you choose to help your Nation. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act is an important step towards investing in American college students and our future workforce, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, and I am glad it will pass today in the House of Representatives, because for too long the disparity between the wealthiest and the poor has been going on and continuing to grow in America. And it is in no small part due to the Republicans not raising the minimum wage in almost 10 years. 
   Imagine this, you work for $5.15 an hour. You work all year round, and not your take-home pay but your gross pay is $10,700. That is $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three every year. 
   The minimum wage has not gone up. Real income, the buying power of the dollar has gone down for Americans. And the cost of health insurance, of gasoline, of home heating, of tuition at college has gone up by $5,000 since the year 2000. So this is an important law to pass today.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, legislation that will reduce interest rates for student borrowers. 
   Now, we all know that the cost of college has gone up every year. In fact, over the last 7 years the cost of a public school education, on average, has increased by 41 percent and at a private school by 7 percent. That is in real dollars. 
   So, how do lower income and middle income students go to higher education? They do it with Pell Grants. In California we do it with the State grants, but we also do it by borrowing. And so I believe that we should lower the interest costs so that anybody who wants to have a higher education, if you want to go back and get your master's, if your child wants to go and get their B.A., that we should be a partner in investment with them. Investing in our people is the most important thing our country can do to be competitive vis-a-vis the rest of the world.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mrs. Maloney of New York for coming up with this, for working with so many of us, because we have heard from so many of the people we represent asking for just some better and fairer types of practices for credit cards. I rise today as a cosponsor of this bill. 
   While the economic crisis on Wall Street is on the front page of every newspaper, many American families are actually dealing with their own crisis at home, and that is this crisis of how they get credit and how they manage credit. 
   Credit card debt in the United States has reached a record high, nearly $1 trillion, and unfortunately, many Americans are subjected to these excessive credit card fees and unfair interest rate increases with no warning, among other misleading and questionable tactics. 
   This legislation today would end practices that would require credit card companies to provide 45 days' notice before interest rate increases, and mailing billing statements 25 calendar days before the due date, instead of only 14. 
   In addition, this bill would prohibit double cycling billing so that companies cannot charge consumers interest on debt that they actually have already paid on time. 
   This legislation provides consumers with needed protections, while allowing credit card companies to balance the financial risk of the consumers they lend to. I think that's what's important, that the credit card companies also have to take responsibility for the type of credit risk that they're taking on. 
   We're talking so much today about credit risks. Well, this is one of the areas that is incredibly important. This has been going on for too long. Credit card companies just give credit to anybody, and they're really not taking the responsibility of what type of risk is there. 
   We have to protect the access to credit, but we also have to take into account and protect Americans against some of these bad practices.

   Women in every country around the world face an every-day battle for their safety, and for equal rights, civil rights, and human rights. 
   Even here in this country, every day, women are victims of sexual assault, abuse, and domestic violence. 
   Today, I stand with my colleagues in the House--with women in this country, and with women around the world--to make a commitment to work together to end discrimination and violence against women. 
   Yesterday, I returned from a trip where I led a Congressional delegation of female members to visit Iraq. While. we were there, we met with Iraqi women who told us that they are treated like second class citizens. 
   This is unacceptable. Women in Iraq deserve the same basic human rights and civil liberties as men. It is fitting that we should take this occasion, on the day before March 8th--International Women's Day--to restate this basic and essential message. 
   I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution, a message to women everywhere--that this House is committed to fight for their civil rights, human rights, and their right to live each day without fear of sexual abuse, assault, and domestic violence.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Leo McCarthy, former Lieutenant Governor of California, who passed away last month after a long illness due to a kidney ailment. 
   Born in New Zealand, Leo began his lifetime of public service for his adopted country as a member the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command in the Korean War. 
   His political service began in 1963 when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and later to the California Assembly, where he had the honor and distinction of serving as speaker from 1974 to 1980. 
   In 1982 he was elected Lieutenant Governor--a position he held until 1994. 
   Leo's dedication to his community was clear from the diversity of issues on which he worked: from assisting welfare recipients, to increasing breast cancer awareness, to finding ways to stop toxic contamination. 
   He also worked to promote tolerance by establishing the Lieutenant Governor's Commission on the Prevention of Hate Violence. 
   After leaving the political field, Leo continued to serve the community by founding the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco. 
   This Center, where young men and women can learn and be inspired to pursue a life and career of ethical public service, is a fitting legacy for a man whose life was devoted to serving the community. 
   Leo McCarthy is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, their four children and eleven grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1175, a bill that I have introduced for two consecutive Congresses. I am pleased to see that the bill is on the Suspension Calendar today. I would like to thank the House leadership for making that happen. 
   H.R. 1175 would increase the ceiling on the federal share of the Orange County, California, Regional Water Reclamation Project--from $20 million to $51,874,849. This project will ultimately allow Orange County to complete its innovative groundwater replenishment system, which is designed to reuse advanced treated wastewater to recharge the aquifer in northern Orange County. 
   This aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for over 144,000 families in Orange County each year, serving about 2.3 million residents from north and central Orange County. This reclamation effort has the potential of creating a new water supply of 72,000 acre-feet per year. 
   The OC Groundwater Replenishment Project is an innovative program which has drawn national and international attention. Many U.S. states and foreign nations--including Japan, Korea, Taiwan--have come to Orange County to look at our tertiary cleaning system. They have observed that reusing recycled water--especially important in the arid west--will help preserve and recharge overdrawn river and groundwater supplies, and will help protect our environment from unexpected scarcity of water. 
   What this bill does is to increase the federal share of the project, bringing it closer to the 25 percent level, the level at which almost every other reclamation project is funded in the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act of 1992 and the Reclamation Cycling and Water Conservation Act. 
   The project is not just important to Orange County, California, but also to the entire western United States. By recycling our own water, we will not rely so heavily on the Colorado River Aqueduct or water from the San Francisco Bay Delta. 
   Members from both sides of the aisle recognize the need for this project and have been consistently supportive of this effort. I would like to thank, in particular, my colleagues from Orange County who are all original cosponsors of this bill. I appreciate their continued support for this legislation, and this important project. 
   Let me thank, again, the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. Rahall, for his support, as well as Ranking Member Young, Subcommittee Chairwoman Napolitano and Ranking Member McMorris for their overwhelming support of H.R. 1175. 
   Finally, let me thank Denis Bilodeau, Irv Pickler, Virginia Grebbien, Philip Anthony, Craig Miller, and everyone affiliated with the Orange County Water District and Orange County Sanitation District for their hard work and leadership in groundwater treatment and recycling. Their innovation has put Orange County at the forefront of water recycling and groundwater replenishment technology. I thank them for all they continue to do for Orange County. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. Speaker, over the past 3 months, the new Democratic Congress has reached across the aisle to work with Republicans on legislation that is going to produce positive results for the American people. We vowed to run this House differently than the Republicans, and since day one, we have lived up to that promise. 
   During our first 100 hours, we passed legislation increasing the minimum wage, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, making college more affordable, securing our Nation by implementing the 9/11 recommendations and ending subsidies for big oil companies. 
   Since that time, we passed legislation that changes the direction of the war in Iraq, but also fully funding our troops and supporting our veterans. At the end of last month, we also passed a budget resolution that balances our budget within 5 years, something that the Bush administration and his budgets have not been able to do. 
   Not only is our budget fiscally responsible, it also increases the funding for children's health care, for education and for veterans health care, all without raising taxes. Yes, we are going in a new direction.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Head Start Program and I am encouraged by H.R. 1429, the Head Start Improvement Act of 2007. 
   I am a Head Start kid. I have firsthand experience of the comprehensive education programs and opportunities that Head Start provides to low-income families. 
   Head Start programs promote school readiness by assisting with the social and cognitive development of young children. Research consistently identifies the early years of a child's development as ever more crucial to the child's lifetime success. 
   Many Head Start programs already try to incorporate new research into their strategies through education, health, nutrition, and social services. This bill ensures that local Head Start programs have the resources to undertake the best practices for furthering a child's development. 
   Head Start is about the family. As I received education and health services, my mother learned valuable lessons on how to become a more active and involved parent in America's public school system. 
   I am glad to see that this bill maintains the existing shared governance structure to help empower parents and allow programs to be responsive to local needs. 
   What's more, this bill is good for Head Start teachers. This bill takes the necessary steps to ensure that Head Start teachers' salaries and professional development are in line with the responsibility that we assign to them. 
   The Head Start Improvement Act of 2007 is a good bill that will keep Head Start strong so it can remain the great program that it was for me, and continues to be for so many Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in opposition to the President's decision to send more of our troops to Iraq. 
   I was against this war from the onset. On October 10, 2002, I was one of  the few who voted against the resolution authorizing the President to use military force in Iraq. But the authorization passed, and we went to war. At that point we supported our troops and we wanted to win, and we want win. And I have voted for every appropriation bill to give our troops what they need to achieve their mission. 
   So here we are, more than 4 years later, and what do we have to show for this war? Violence in Iraq continues to skyrocket. This past December was the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians since the war began. 
   Over the course of this war, 45,000 to 65,000 Iraqi civilians have lost their lives, maybe more; we really don't know, because nobody is counting here in America. And over 3,000 brave American troops, men and women in our Armed Forces, have lost their lives. My home State of California sends the most to the services. We alone have lost 325 men and women in Iraq, and we have sustained about 2,500 injuries to our military personnel, more than any other State in the United States. 
   And Iraqis have paid the price. Our military, their families; the families of our military are the ones sacrificing in this war. They have paid the price, and our country has paid the price for this President's war. 
   Yet Iraq is less secure than ever, even before the President's ``mission accomplished'' declaration. There is no functioning infrastructure, no banking system, zero economic stability. Iraq is not secure, Baghdad is not secure. The Iraq Study Group reported that the President's strategy in Iraq is failing. It is failing. 
   And how does our President respond? With more of the same. He wants to send 21,500 more of our men and women into Iraq to carry out the same failure. 
   The President has failed to articulate what these new troops will do that is different from what has been done over the past few years. What is his plan? Four surges? Four surges that didn't work. He wants to do it again? 
   And believe me, sitting on the Armed Services Committee, I have been here to see it. I was the one in the first few months who told General Franks, this is an insurgency, it is guerrilla warfare. He refused to call it that. I was the one that went to Iraq when General Odierno told me there were only 359 insurgents left, that we were almost there, while the day before, his boss, Abizaid, had said he thought there were about 5,000. That was 2 years ago. 
   I was there when Secretary Rumsfeld was saying we have trained 89,000; 2 days later, 95,000; a week later, 160,000 Iraqi Army. This was 2 years ago. Just pulling numbers out of the air, that is what they were doing to America. 
   And I was there in Iraq the day that General Petraeus, who was successful in Mosul, and then Mosul fell because he pulled his troops from there to Fallujah, and to try to take Fallujah. And he said to me with tears in his eyes, We couldn't hold Mosul because we had to take the troops to go to Fallujah.     
   At that point he said, We didn't have enough troops. But the President didn't listen. The President fails to grasp that military action alone is not sufficient to stabilize Iraq. And without a legitimate diplomatic component, there will be no end to the civil war in Iraq. But the President has refused to engage the powers in the region. He has outright rejected the notion of dialogue with Iran and Syria, a key suggestion from the Iraq Study Group. It is not the role of Congress to command our forces. That is the constitutional responsibility given to the Commander in Chief. But he has to do it right. And we have to hold him accountable for our failures in Iraq.  
   As Commander-in-Chief, that responsibility is up to President Bush. 
   The President must be frank with Congress and with the American people, and admit that the strategy in Iraq to date has been a complete failure. 
   The President must come up with a new strategy to stabilize the situation in Iraq, one that ends with the redeployment of our troops home. What is his plan? 
   My message for the President is this: 
   The voters have told you, Mr. President, that they have had enough of your failed strategy in Iraq. 
   And today, Mr. President, this Congress is telling you that we too have had enough of your failed strategy in Iraq. 
   Our troops deserve more from you. You have ignored the American people's wishes. You have ignored the Iraq Study Group's recommendations. 
   Today, I hope you will not ignore this Congress. I hope you will not send any more of our Armed Forces into harm's way, until you have a plan to win. 
   Our military is the strongest and most capable in the world, but they cannot continue to be overextended and asked to participate in your failing strategy. 
    Mr. President, I ask you to listen to the American people, the Iraq Study Group, and this Congress. 
   We are telling you clearly that we do not want you to send any more troops to participate in a failing strategy. It is your responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief, to come up with an actual plan to stabilize Iraq and begin bringing our troops home to their families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I do not think I have to further remind this Congress about how far off base the President is over the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The health care system is failing our Nation's children who are in need. Too many are without health insurance and do not receive the regular care they need. 
   For this President, the supposed evil of two million children possibly switching health coverage to state sponsored healthcare is enough to block coverage for six million additional poor children. 
   Seven hundred and fifty thousand children were added to the rolls of the uninsured last year and the number of employers that offer health benefits to the children of workers continues to shrink. 
   Yet the President stands firm to a proposal for SCHIP that would not even be able to maintain existing coverage and would impose unconscionable hurdles on families whose children need health care. 
   One must question the principles of this President. How, in good conscious, could he ask for an additional $190 billion for a war that two-thirds of the American people oppose while calling $5 billion for one of our nation's most successful programs reckless spending? 
   The American people deserve better and our Nation's children deserve the right to have health insurance.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in jubilant support of H. Res. 471, recognizing the Anaheim Ducks and their victory over the Ottawa Senators in the National Hockey League Stanley Cup Finals. I applaud the House's consideration of this exciting measure. 
   The Ottawa Senators proved to be worthy opponents, but they were no match for the hard hitting, exciting brand of hockey of Ducks general manager Brian Burke and head coach Randy Carlyle. 
   The 6-2 win to clinch the title was a display of solid teamwork as five different Ducks scored goals. 
   The Ducks teamwork was buttressed by the awe inspiring defensive work of Scott Niedermayer, who was honored as the most valuable player of the NHL post-season. 
   Their work is a true accomplishment. Not only did the Anaheim Ducks bring the Stanley Cup to Anaheim for the first time, but they are the first team from California to win it all. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, we congratulate the Anaheim Ducks for their marvelous play and celebrate their victory in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.  
   The resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, on May 18, 2007, a young mother was executed in cold blood by her former live-in boyfriend. The woman's 11-year-old daughter was in the house and heard her mother begging for her life, then a pause, then a gunshot, and then silence. 
   Santa Ana Police Detective Chuck Salle, badge number 2005, was on assignment to the United States Marshall's Fugitive Task Force and was tasked with tracking down and arresting that suspect. 
   Task force members located the suspect in a crowded restaurant and arranged a meeting away from the public area. Detective Salle approached the suspect, identified himself as a police officer, and the suspect pointed his gun directly at Salle's head and fired. The bullet missed, officers returned fire, and the suspect fell to the ground fatally wounded. 
   Today, the Treasury Department will recognize Officer Salle with the highest valor award that they honor ATF agents with. 
   Today, I publicly commend and thank Detective Salle, the United States Marshall's Fugitive Task Force, and law enforcement officers all across this great Nation for their efforts in protecting and serving our communities, day or night, rain or shine, every minute of the day.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express concern about the ongoing subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis and the administration's ``plan'' to address the crisis. 
   The administration proposed a 5-year interest rate freeze, something that should have angered the investor community. I should know; before I came to Congress, I was an investment advisor. But the investor community was not upset. We ask, why? Well, the reason why is that the voluntary rate freeze will only apply to a small number of the subprime loans that are in danger of default and foreclosure. The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that the administration's plan will affect 7 percent of subprime borrowers. 
   This plan is based on the unrealistic belief that the subprime market failure will cure itself. Real leadership is needed to help homeowners and the United States economy. The President needs to show support for the House-passed legislation that provides additional options for borrowers in distress and strengthens the regulation of the mortgage lending practices.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   I would like to thank my chairman, Mr. Skelton, for his really great work in producing a Defense bill with support from both sides of the aisle. It is commendable that Chairman Skelton was able to pass this bill on a vote of 58-0, given the heated and the very polarized debates that we were having in the House Armed Services Committee, especially with respect to the war in Iraq. 
   And as Chairman Skelton has repeatedly said, the purpose of this bill is to provide our troops with the equipment and the support that they need to carry out their mission. 
   I, for example, voted against granting the President the authority to use force in Iraq, and I have continued to question his repeated surges and his failing policies in Iraq. I have repeatedly asked the President to provide a plan to safely redeploy our troops to come home from Iraq. 
   But, having said this, until we can get our brave men and women home from Iraq, we must provide them with what they need to perform their mission. And that is what this bill does. At the same time, it asks the tough questions of the Defense Department and of this President.  
   One question, for example, that I have for the Department of Defense that I have been asking over and over for the last 4 years, what happened to the approximately 329,000 Iraqi security forces that had been trained? Specifically, where are they assigned? Are they reporting for duty? Or are they now working for the insurgency? And this bill asks that question. 
   The Defense authorization bill as a whole asks for accountability and for oversight from the President and from the Department of Defense. And I ask my colleagues to stand together and to pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, President Bush and congressional Republicans know they have a perception problem with the American people when it comes to being fiscally responsible. 
   The fact is, they inherited a record surplus from President Clinton back in 2001, and over the next 6 years they turned that surplus into record deficits. In fact, it's so bad that President Bush has the distinction of borrowing more money from foreign nations than all of his 42 predecessors combined. That is not a record to brag about. And so now the President and some Republicans are attempting to wipe away 6 years of fiscal mismanagement by opposing a bipartisan bill that would provide quality health care coverage to 10 million children. 
   The problem is, the bill that they are opposing is completely paid for. You see, when we took over the House in January, we restored pay-as-you-go rules so that we could finally tackle our Nation's deficit. The bipartisan children's health care bill would not add one cent to our Nation's deficit. And House Republicans need to realize that this bill is bipartisan for a reason.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, the children's health insurance legislation passed by the House last month was a bipartisan bill that provided health care coverage to 10 million American children. Although it received overwhelming support from the American people, from 43 Governors, and a veto-proof majority in the Senate, the majority of House Republicans rejected it and said they had specific concerns. 
   To address their concerns, House Democrats met with Republicans and introduced a revised SCHIP bill last week. We clarified three key points. One, there wasn't any possibility of higher income families being eligible; two, it further clarified that immigrants without documents would not have access to the program; and, three, it phased out over 1 year the coverage of childless adults. 
   But, Madam Speaker, Republicans in this body just can't take yes for an answer. Even after addressing their concerns in this revised bill, many of our colleagues still insisted on standing with President Bush, instead of with working American families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I wish to thank Chairman Skelton for his hard work and leadership in developing this important piece of legislation. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, I would also like to say to the gentlemen who are retiring this year, I think just on the top row of our committee, we are probably losing collectively about 65 years of experience on this committee, and it has been my pleasure over the last 12 years to serve on this committee with you all, and you will sorely be missed and the institutional knowledge that you carry will be missed also. So we have a lot of good colleagues who are leaving the Congress this year. 
   This legislation provides critical support to our Armed Forces through many important initiatives. I'm proud that the legislation, for example, provides a 3.9 percent across-the-board pay raise for the members of our services. And in addition, H.R. 5658 prohibits the implementation of the President's proposals to increase health care co-pays and cost sharing for beneficiaries of the TRICARE health care and pharmacy services. 
   This bill also takes a step in providing for the first time ever the military preventative health care programs, which will improve the lives of our servicemembers, of our retirees, and family members. Preventative health care has been proven to improve individuals' long-term health and to provide substantial cost savings since healthier people require less medical service. And I'm very pleased that Chairwoman DAVIS proposed this innovative health care program and that it is also paid for. 
   This bill also includes several proposals that I sought to have included. And as the ranking woman on the Armed Services Committee, I am proud that one of these provisions establishes a centralized case-level database of information about sexual assaults that involve our servicemembers. The database will be consistent with all privacy guidelines and restrictions while tracking information about the nature of assaults and the outcome of any legal proceedings in connection with the assault. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank the chairwoman for the 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this historic case took place in my hometown and I get to represent that area of central Orange County. The case is really about many families. The Mendez family was the first family in the brief. It was also about many areas of Orange County, not just Westminster. It covered the central portion because in those days, of course, there were the white schools and there were the Mexican schools. 
   Now the Mexican schools were interesting because it wasn't just Mexicans who went there. It was anybody who looked different. Japanese Americans went there. Native Americans went there. Black Americans went there. 
   And the case in point was that when the Japanese family was interned and was able to hold onto their property by having Gonzalo Mendez farm it, he began to make more money and so he was in a position to hire lawyers, a lawyer out of Texas and a lawyer out of Los Angeles, to come and fight the issue of why do some children go to the white school and some go to the Mexican school. 
   You see, when Sylvia's aunt took her children and Sylvia down to the school that day, now that they had moved to a new property where they could farm, when they went down the block to the local school, the children of the aunt were allowed to go to the school because they were lighter in skin. But Sylvia was darker in her complexion, and she was told that those children must go to the Mexican school across town. And having taken these children back with her and saying that was not fair, the discussion went on in the family. And Felicitas, I know, like any mother and any wife would do, sat up all night and shook her husband Gonzalo and said: You're making money now, this isn't fair, do something about it. And that is how they came together as families to put forward such an important decision. And Thurgood Marshall was part of that, representing the NAACP at the time. And, in turn, when we were able to change the law in California, that law was part of the basis for Brown v. Board of Education at the national level. 
   Why do we pass such a resolution today? Because we have to keep reminding ourselves of our history and of the importance of change and what that means. I will tell you why. Sylvia Mendez, the darker daughter who was not allowed in the school, the very case around her, she didn't even know that this had occurred. Sylvia read it in college in a history book. And as she was reading it, she said, Could that be me and could that be my parents? And why didn't they ever tell me about it? 
   This is the reason we remember, so that all children across our Nation will  understand that all of them will get the opportunity that is America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to set the record straight. This administration has accused Congress of being a ``failure,'' and that is simply not true. I think the President has this Congress confused with last year's ``Do-Nothing Congress.'' This Congress has successfully passed numerous pieces of legislation that have been supported by the majority of the American people and the President has signed into law. 
   We passed, for example, H.R. 1, to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations and to provide greater protection for first responders and security for our country. We have raised the minimum wage, improved our economic competitiveness, and enacted the College Cost Reduction Act. I am particularly proud of this law, which increases funding for Federal Pell Grants by more than $11 billion and will make college more affordable for low-income students. 
   And then of course there is SCHIP. This Congress has bent over backwards to address concerns about the legislation, and yet this administration continues to oppose health care for our Nation's most vulnerable children. I am proud to go home this weekend and tell my constituents about what this Congress has done.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1401, The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, of which I am an original cosponsor. This legislation will make long overdue security improvements to the rail, transit, and surface transportation systems in our nation. 
   In the last 80 years there have been over 900 attacks on public transportation systems around the world. In recent history, the horrific attacks in Madrid, London, and Mumbai have been unfortunate reminders that we must do more to secure our Nation's transportation systems. For too long, our country has not done enough to improve the security of our transportation systems. In fact President Bush's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal included $41.4 million in the Transportation Security Administration budget for surface transportation security, less than 1 percent of the TSA budget. Clearly the past level of funding has been inadequate to address the security of the surface transportation system. I am very pleased that H.R. 1401 authorizes three grant programs that will make more funds available to enhance the security of rail, public transportation and over-the-road systems. 
   The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 requires rail and public transportation systems to submit vulnerability assessments and security plans to the Department of Homeland Security. Each system is then placed into a risk tier, those in medium and high risk tiers have to have Department of Homeland Security approval for their security plans. Each transportation system will then employ security measures to address the type and degree of risk they face. This approach will help increase the security of our transportation systems, while allowing them the flexibility to adopt measures that meet their needs. 
   I am particularly pleased that the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 requires that rail and public transportation systems provide their employees with adequate training. This training requirement will enable employees to respond efficiently to prevent potential terrorist attacks and to minimize the damage and loss of life if an attack does occur. I am also pleased that this legislation establishes a rail and public transportation security exercise program so that systems can practice and perfect their responses to potential attacks. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank both my chairmen for the time. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. As the chairwoman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism, I have the jurisdiction over the Coast Guard's security missions. I am very pleased that the Homeland Security Committee had the opportunity to mark up this legislation and that we included several provisions that will strengthen the Coast Guard's maritime security activities. 
   This bill increases the Coast Guard's end strength by 1,500 members to ensure that there are adequate personnel to carry out all of the Coast Guard's missions. This addresses my long-standing concerns about inadequate staffing at the Coast Guard. 
   The legislation also requires the use of security zones around all liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facilities. This is a critical step in stopping these facilities from becoming targets as the number of LNG imports increases. 
   This bill will also improve the lot of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC, by providing more facilities where workers can submit their fingerprints so they can enroll in TWIC more efficiently and meet the September 25, 2008, deadline. This affects 650,000 port workers. In addition, the legislation enhances oversight of TWIC by requiring reports to Congress and the GAO on ongoing program implementation. 
   H.R. 2830 requires the establishment of an additional maritime security response team. Currently there is only one in the Nation, and it is based on the east coast. It makes sense to have a second one, because, of course, there are plenty of people on the west coast, and we need it. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and its many provisions. It strengthens the security operations and the safety operations that our Coast Guard does. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of those who worked so hard on this bill.

   Among all of the dedicated first responders in our cities and towns, several local agencies have taken their commitment a step further by sponsoring Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces. There are 28 Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces around the country, including one in my own district, sponsored by the Orange County Fire Authority. 
   These task forces stand ready to respond to natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes, and to terrorist attacks. For example, FEMA deployed 25 of the 28 on 9/11, and 28 of the 28 task forces to Hurricane Katrina. 
   Despite the fact that these task forces are deployed by FEMA, they  have not been authorized by the Congress and as a result, the task force members are not eligible for Federal disability or death benefits if they are injured while federally deployed. 
   I have introduced H.R. 4183, the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act of 2007, which could give them the protections that they deserve. I hope all Members will join me in moving this legislation forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it feels great to call you Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Implementing the 9/11 Recommendations Act of 2007, and as a Member who has been on the Homeland Security Committee since its inception and a ranking member on one of its major committees, I am really thrilled that we are bringing this legislation on the real first day of legislative business. 
   There are some really essential things in this. One major thing would be to achieve real security by implementing and distributing most homeland security grant funding on the basis of risk. After the Department of Homeland Security's completion of a comprehensive risk assessment, States with lower risks will be guaranteed 25 percent funding, or 45 percent if that State has an international land or sea border. This is important because, as we know, there are many States that need that money, and they need it now. 
   Another important provision of this will be the infrastructure database, one that I have been talking about for the last 4 years and trying to get together. Let's just get that done. These requirements would satisfy the 9/11 Commission recommendation for the development of a reliable and complete list of the Nation's critical infrastructure to be used so we can help to assess the threats and allocate the limited resources that we have. 
   Of course, I am particularly pleased we are going to have an Office of Appeals and Redress. This is something that I offered as an amendment in committee which is included in this legislation so that people who are on the terrorist list have some way to get off if they are innocent.  
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Implementing the 9/11 Recommendations Act of 2007. 
   Over the last several Congresses, my work as the ranking member of the Economic Security, Infrastructure Security and Cyber Security Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee has focused on the threats to our Nation's security and how we can best protect ourselves from those threats. 
   This legislation is an essential step towards achieving real security by implementing outstanding 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   One major security enhancement in this legislation is the move to distribute most homeland security grant funding on the basis of risk. 
   After the Department of Homeland Security's completion of comprehensive risk assessments, States with lower risk will be guaranteed 25 percent of all homeland security funding, or 45 percent if the State has an international land or sea border. 
   This provision strikes an appropriate balance between allocating most of the funding based on risk, while ensuring that every State will have the funding to maintain the necessary level of preparedness. 
   Another important provision in this legislation requires annual updates of the National Asset Database, and the creation of a subset, the National At-Risk Database which will list the infrastructure most at risk to terrorist attacks. 
   In addition, the provision requires the Department of Homeland Security to consult each State annually to discuss their assets, and confer with them before removing a State asset from the Database. 
   These requirements satisfy the 9/11 Commission recommendation for the development of a reliable and complete list of the Nation's critical infrastructure to be used to assess threats and allocate infrastructure protection grants. 
   I am also particularly pleased that a provision to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress that I offered as an amendment in Committee was included in this legislation. 
   I drafted this provision in response to my constituents' frustrations when they were held up because they had the same name as someone on the no-fly list, a frustration that I experienced personally several months ago. 
   The establishment of this DHS-wide office will ensure a timely and fair process for individuals that are wrongly identified, to seek redress, correct their records and reduce, or end, repeated delays and missed flights. 
   These are just a few of the important provisions in H.R. 1 that will improve our Nation's security. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank my colleague for putting together this hour to discuss what I think is something that is very important; that is, what the Blue Dogs are thinking about in this Congress and what we have been trying to do. 
   Now, I will tell you that I have been in the Congress for 11 years. This is my 11th year. I have been a Blue Dog the entire time. And that really comes from the fact that before I came to the Congress, I was an investment banker. I am an MBA, I have been in the international finance arena for 14 years before coming to this Congress. 
   So people ask me, what is the thing that you worry about the most when you go to sleep at night? And the answer is always the same for me: The structural financial debt and deficit that we have in Washington, D.C., because most people have not looked and seen and realized what has been going on here in Washington, D.C., but I have seen it in the last 11 years.     
   That is why, as a Blue Dog, I also have that sign up that says what today's national debt is and how much of that $29,000, if every man, child, woman in America, would give us $29,000 today, we would be able to bring down the national debt. But the fact of the matter is, we don't. We don't, and the debt keeps climbing. 
   So a few years ago, we were trying to think about, well, how is it that this has happened? Because when I came, it was in 1997. I had 4 years under President Clinton, and at that time, the debt of this Nation, the interest payments on that, was 18 cents of every dollar that we collected, 18 cents. 
   That means if we collect a dollar from you in taxes, 18 cents of it we don't spend because we are paying the interest cost on that. Imagine if you did that in your home for every dollar. 
   So what did we do? We worked hard. We instituted PAYGO. What does that mean? Well, it means you don't make any new spending unless you are going to tax, put in an amount of money for it, or you are going to take it away from some other area you are already spending on in order to spend in your new priority area, much the way people do it at home when we have to decide among the priorities. 
   Okay, well, this month, September, I have to get the shoes for the kids for school, so that means that there are going to be no days out of that month that we get to go out and eat at a restaurant. I mean, you just make up for it in one way or another. 
   But the Congress and the United States do not do this. They keep spending, even when they give tax cuts. So that means if your boss told you we are going to give you a 70 percent cut in the amount of money you take home, and you go home and you tell your husband that, but he still keeps spending the same amount of money every month, he doesn't bring his expenses down. 
   So it is a problem. So we spend, I would say, honestly, about 700 to $800 billion more a year than the monies we take in. 
   Now, we will throw numbers around, to $143 billion, deficit, $400 billion, deficit, $358 billion. No, no, no, no, no. The reality is that we are overspending by anywhere between 700 and $800 billion every year. That is why this number goes up, because we cannot get this under control.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Absolutely. So I started in this Congress 11 years ago, and we spent 18 cents of every dollar just on paying interest on interest payments. Then we tightened our belts; we did PAYGO. President Clinton and others, we worked together, we brought it down. In the year 2000 when President Bush took over, we were paying 11 cents of every dollar on interest. So we had brought it down. 
   Then, of course, the President decided to give tax breaks to some of the wealthiest Americans. I know, because I got a tax break, but not everybody got a tax break. The real people who really needed the tax breaks, I think, did not receive them. That is why I didn't vote for it. I received it because the majority, the Republicans at that time voted it in, but I didn't vote for it because I know what fair is fair. 
   If you get opportunity in this country and you work hard, and you get a few breaks and a little bit of luck along the way, that can happen in America for almost anybody. And some of it is luck, and you happen to make money. I think you should understand that to keep America full of opportunities, we need to pay our taxes. 
   So I am willing to do that, but not this President, because he cut the taxes on the people who had lots of money and who were making lots of money. His own comptroller told us several years ago that 70 percent of the deficit every year in this country is due to the tax breaks that the President gave. In other words, we kept spending even though we didn't take in revenue. In fact, we returned back revenue. 
   Then, of course, we have the $3 billion a week of money we spend in Iraq. I will not tell you the way I feel. This President went into Iraq on the cheap. He didn't think that Americans would really want to spend the kind of money it took to put in 200,000 or 300,000 troops to do the job the day we went in. So he told his Secretary of Defense, despite what the generals told him, Shinseki, who said we need at least 200,000 or more troops in there, they did it at the level of 110, and now we are paying for it. Now we have been in a war much longer than we ever anticipated, much longer than the President ever anticipated.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (PELL GRANT EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 990--The Pell Grant Equity Act of 2007. This legislation is a simple measure to reduce the real and perceived barriers to a higher education for many low-income families across the United States. 
   Community colleges and other low-cost institutions offer life-changing educational opportunities for motivated students. Pell grant recipients are by definition motivated. 
   The Pell grant program works as a contract between the Federal Government and the individual. The Government says, ``we will provide you with the means to get a higher education if you desire to invest in yourself.'' 
   Removing the tuition sensitivity provision of the Higher Education Act will help students cover the full cost of attending college, which is significantly higher than tuition alone. 
   For over 30 years, Congress has consistently increased funding available to the Pell grant program and increased the maximum grant that each student can receive. Why? Because the program works. Pell grant recipients regularly go on to succeed in jobs with career potential and upward mobility. 
   Increased access to higher education is an important goal for the Congress because having an educated workforce is essential to our country's future. As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said to me, ``if our people are educated there isn't a problem we can't solve. If they aren't, there isn't one that we can.'' Eliminating tuition sensitivity from the Pell grant program is a positive step towards making college education available to everyone who wants one, and there isn't a higher goal than that.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. 
   H.R. 3915 restricts the harmful mortgage lending products that have wreaked havoc on our local communities. 
   In my district in Orange County, California, the cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana are feeling the effects of irresponsible lending practices that resulted in numerous foreclosures. 
   One-third of the homes on the market in those cities are available because they were foreclosed on. 
   Borrowers who will only purchase a home once or twice in their lifetimes should not be blamed for the current situation. 
   Through the licensing of mortgage loan originators, the establishment of loan origination standards, and the enhancement of consumer protections, H.R. 3915 takes appropriate steps to stop predatory lending practices without placing an undue burden on responsible mortgage originators and lenders. 
   These new standards will provide needed safeguards without preventing potential homebuyers from obtaining loans. 
   Eventually, the financial services industry will recover from the current mortgage crisis, and we must ensure that the predatory practices of the past are not repeated in the future.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California. 
   Juanita Millender-McDonald was my friend. I used to love coming into the Chamber and sitting down next to her and asking, ``What's up, what's going on,'' because Juanita knew. She knew what was going on in the Congress. She was the mayor of Congress, if you will, being the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee. And Juanita knew what was going on back in California. 
   When I first decided to run for Congress and nobody knew, Juanita called me up and said, ``I'm stuck on the freeway, but I'm coming down to walk precincts with you. So let's hope the sun stays up and we get to go and walk together.'' And we did, and that is how I met Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   When I first came to the Congress, and coming as a young woman which, quite frankly, 12 years ago there weren't a lot of us, it was always very difficult and hard to be accepted. It is always hard to find your way in the Congress. But Juanita was right there. She was like a touchstone. She was somebody that I could talk to and tell her my frustrations or the happy points here. She really is what I would call a friend, and to many of us here she was a friend. She is a friend back in her district. 
   I wish the people of the United States really understood the work that Juanita did. The Alameda Corridor was her dream. It was her project. This was the project to move goods that come to this country from the port across and through L.A. and out into the rest of the United States. When you think of the fact that 50 percent of everything that comes into the United States comes through the ports that were right there at Juanita's side, you would understand how important it was to each and every American. You see, if that cargo didn't leave L.A., if you were an auto worker in Tennessee, building a car, and you were waiting for inventory just in time, it wouldn't get there in time if it hadn't been for Juanita. And last year on the very last day of the 109th Congress, we passed the Safe Port Act. That really was Juanita's legislation. 
   She will be remembered for a long time in this country and in this Congress. Juanita, and to her family, I love her.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6028, the Merida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008. H.R. 6028 creates a foundation for future cooperation in assisting our neighbors to the south in combating the rise of organized crime. 
   This legislation is a good starting point but much more work will need to be done, including significant transnational and interagency cooperation, in order to ensure the success of the Merida Initiative. I was disappointed that the House Homeland Security Committee was not included in the development of this bill, despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security will play a large role in the Initiative by coordinating its agencies that are already assisting Mexico and other foreign governments to address smuggling, trafficking and violence on our borders. 
   Last week the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism, which I have the privilege of chairing, had a hearing entitled ``The Merida Initiative: Examining U.S. Efforts to Combat Transnational Criminal Organizations.'' This hearing highlighted the importance of the Merida Initiative in stemming the growing transnational crime in the United States and on our borders. For example, in my home district in Orange County, CA, gang violence is on the rise as a result of the huge presence of the largest transnational gang in the United States, Mara Salvatrucha, in Los Angeles County. It is reported that there are over 900 members of Mara Salvatrucha in Los Angeles County, and many of these gang members are in the United States illegally. The rise of this type of gang in the United States can be linked to a practice by many of the drug cartels of ``contracting out'' drug, ammunition, and weapon smuggling activities to these gang members. The Homeland Security hearing emphasized that many agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security will need to work together closely to stop these growing transnational crime networks. 
   H.R. 6028 must ensure interagency cooperation within the United States in order to succeed abroad with the foreign governments we seek to assist. As I stated earlier, much more needs to be done in order to help stem the violence along the U.S. and Mexican border, but this bill helps build the necessary foundation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to help ensure further cooperation between the key departments involved in its implementation.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the service of Anaheim City School District Superintendent Sandra Barry and to wish her luck in her upcoming retirement. 
   Throughout her 11 years with the school district, including the last 8 as superintendent, Mrs. Barry has done an excellent job leading the Anaheim City School District, which is the largest elementary school district in Orange County and one of the largest in the State of California. 
   I applaud Superintendent Barry's commitment to the entire Anaheim community. Mrs. Barry has given her time and energy to many causes, including being on the board of directors for the Tiger Woods Foundation, the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA and the Police Chief Community Advisory Board. Her dedication to the community and the future of our Anaheim children is clear through her many achievements. 
   I sincerely thank superintendent Barry for her leadership, her commitment and her dedication to brightening the academic future of every Anaheim elementary student. She will be missed, but her lasting influence, and especially with respect to all the educators in the district, will go on for a long time in Anaheim. 
   I wish my good friend the best in her retirement, and I thank her for making the Anaheim City School District a great place to learn.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in full support of H.R. 3043, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. By bringing this bill to the House floor, we demonstrate again the hard work of the Democratic majority to reverse the trend of critical cuts to programs that improve the lives of all Americans. 
   The bill includes an additional $750 million for the National Institutes of Health, another $400 million for the Social Security Administration to address the backlog of disability cases and reviews and, most dramatically, $2 billion additionally to improve the requirements of No Child Left Behind. 
   Additionally, Head Start will get $75 million in additional funding under this bill. But when you look at it, in real dollar terms, that's actually a decrease. Head Start is widely recognized as one of our most productive education programs. For every dollar that we spend on Head Start we bring in $9 in future benefits in taxes. So the benefits of Head Start do not end just with the preparation for school. 
   And I understand there are budgetary constraints but, Mr. Speaker, I hope that in the conference committee we can actually put real money into Head Start.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3887, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   This is an issue that impacts countries around the world, whether they are a source or destination for trafficked persons. Official estimates are that between 2 to 4 million persons are trafficked each year, including approximately 17,500 individuals who are trafficked into the United States. 
   One country that is a major source of trafficking victims is Vietnam. The congressional district that I represent in Orange County, California, is home to one of the largest Vietnamese constituencies outside of Vietnam. Hence, I have met with many people who have been trafficked from Vietnam, as well as advocates who work to help these victims. 
   I have personally visited Vietnam 3 times, and it has been apparent from my trips that human trafficking is a major problem facing women, children, and men in Vietnam. Vietnamese women are trafficked to other countries in Asia and elsewhere, where they are subsequently forced into marriage, labor, and prostitution. 
   Often, Vietnamese women are promised employment, and given fake working papers, but then they are instead sold into marriage, the commercial sex industry, or labor. These women often find themselves in a foreign country, with no legal status, and no ability to speak the language. 
   Given the large numbers of trafficked persons from Vietnam, and around the world, I am glad that the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act adds technical assistance and support to assist foreign governments with the prevention and prosecution of human trafficking cases. 
   It is critical that the United States share its resources to combat trafficking with the rest of the world. All of the members of our world community must work together to fight human trafficking. 
   The United States must also work to improve its efforts to combat trafficking within our own borders. This bill will assist with enhancing the rights of victims, who are trafficked into the United States, and will provide special protections to child victims. 
   H.R. 3887 is an important step in the worldwide fight against human trafficking. At the same time, we must continue to work on this issue in our local communities. In my district, a number of agencies, including law enforcement, service providers, and community organizations have joined together to form the Orange County Human Trafficking, Task Force (OCHTTF). 
   This task force operated for several years without any funding. I am proud that I was able to help them secure funding to continue their collaborative efforts to fight human trafficking. I commend the OCHTTF for its efforts, and hope that more local communities will stand together to protect the rights of all persons to live free from forced marriage, prostitution, and labor.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 868, honoring the 100 year anniversary of the Muir Woods National Monument. 
   Throughout his life, John Muir was concerned with protecting nature to enhance the spiritual side of civilization and progress. His words and deeds led to the establishment of the U.S. National Park System. In addition, John Muir was the founding president of the Sierra Club, which remains one of the leading American grassroots organization for protecting wilderness and the human environment. 
   On January 9, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Muir Woods America's 10th National Monument. When he heard of President Roosevelt's act Muir wrote, ``This is the best tree-lover's monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world.'' 
   Today, Muir Woods attracts about 1 million people every year, and inspires them with redwoods over 260 feet high and more than 1,200 years old. Part of the Golden Gate National Parks, Muir Woods is a living and enduring symbol of John Muir's conservation ethic that nature must be preserved if humanity is to continue to thrive on this planet. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and honor the legacy of a great American, his vision of environmental conservation, and the truly remarkable Muir Woods National Monument.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 954, a resolution honoring Senior Border Patrol Agent Luis A. Aguilar, who recently lost his life in the line of duty. 
   We are fortunate to have a dedicated, brave group of men and women working to secure America's borders. Their efforts and expertise are critical to the success of any border security strategy, and to protecting our nation from dangerous individuals and goods. As the chair of the House Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism, I am familiar with the terrain, conditions, and challenges of the southwest border and I deeply respect and value the work of our Border Patrol agents. 
   I am saddened to rise today to recognize the loss of one of our dedicated Border Patrol agents. On the morning of Saturday, January 19, 2008, Senior Border Patrol Agent Luis A. Aguilar lost his life in the line of duty as he attempted to stop a suspected drug smuggler fleeing through California's Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area outside Yuma, Arizona. We have heard that Agent Aguilar, an El Paso native and nearly 6-year veteran of the Border Patrol, was not supposed to be working that day. However, he reported to work when he realized he was needed. 
   Aguilar's father, a bailiff in El Paso for Judge Mary Ann Bramblett, said senior Agent Aguilar felt a strong commitment to his job and to preventing the flow of illegal drugs across our borders from reaching our communities and families. Judge Bramblett, who knew senior Agent Aguilar since he was a boy, said, ``One of the ways he felt he could really give back to the country was to serve in the Border Patrol. Serving his country and serving his family were the two most important things Luis had in his life.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Senior Border Patrol Agent Luis A. Aguilar gave his life serving our nation. I urge my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Agent Aguilar's extraordinary sacrifice, and in offering our sincere sympathy to his family, friends, and loved ones.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this month is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This is a national celebration which continues to highlight and bring awareness to the many contributions of the Asian Pacific Americans who have made this country their home. 
   I want to thank Mr. Honda, who will be leading a special order in just a few minutes, with respect to all the accomplishments of the Asian Pacific Americans in the United States. 
   I am fortunate to represent one of the largest Asian Pacific populations in Orange County, California. It's full of Japanese, Korean, Hmong, Cambodians, Laotians, Chinese, Hawaiian Pacific Islanders and, of course, the largest Vietnamese population outside the world resides in Orange County, California. Representing that community I see firsthand the rich culture and the contributions and all of these communities bring to my hometown of Anaheim and Orange County. 
   More than 30 years ago, with when the Vietnamese arrived, my district was full of orange groves. They took these orange groves, some of the dilapidated commercial centers, and they made these block-long business districts that generate today, multibillion dollars for our local economy. 
   While being an integrated part of the American social fabric is important, these communities also bring with them a rich awareness of what is going on around the world, in particular, what happens in their homeland. 
   I enjoy an open dialogue, for example, with the Vietnamese American community, especially about the continuing situation in Vietnam, where human rights and religious freedoms, remain a distant dream for the peoples of that country. 
   Now is the time to remember and to celebrate the successes and the contributions that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders bring to the diversity of America. 
   Although it is important to recognize the achievements made by this community, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month must also provide a forum to focus on the problems that face these communities, such as affordable housing, racial profiling, and language barriers. 
   In particular, the health care issues that are so important, so many health care issues that happened in this particular community like hepatitis C, diabetes, and some of the other larger issues which affect us all. 
   One of the problems facing the APAC community is the perception that all the members of their communities are thriving. If you are Asian or Pacific Islander, you must be going to the Berkeleys of the world, you must be doctors, you must be thriving, you must be engineers, you must be great business people. But the reality is that there are large populations, API populations who still have low access to real quality education and they face tremendous language barriers. The API community has come a long way, sacrificing for our country and contributing to our growth and prosperity, and I  look forward to continuing that relationship with the Asian Pacific Islander community to celebrate its contributions and to overcome the ongoing challenges that these communities face.

   This Act will allow for appropriations through 2011 to assist in combating human trafficking and to further provide protection for victims of human sex trafficking in the United States. 
   As the Chairwoman of the Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Counterterrorism, I held a series of hearings entitled ``Crossing the Border: Immigrants in Detention and Victims of Trafficking.'' These hearings identified and discussed many urgent issues related to the prevention of human trafficking and assistance for victims of human trafficking. 
   These issues impact countries around the world, whether they are a source of or destination for trafficked persons. Official estimates show that between 2 to 4 million persons are trafficked each year, including approximately 17,500 individuals who are trafficked into the United States. 
   The United States must also work to improve its efforts to combat trafficking within our own borders. This bill will assist with enhancing the rights of victims, who are trafficked into the United States, and will provide special protections to child victims.

I am very proud of the Task Force's work to reduce human trafficking in southern California, and I urge my colleagues to support these types of task forces as communities around the country work to stop human trafficking 
   H.R. 7311 also provides critical assistance to victims seeking relief and access to special U.S. visas to protect them from their traffickers.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538--the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. 
   At the beginning of this month, when I was in Iraq, I spoke with soldiers who had just learned that their tours had been extended. 
   They said to me, ``Please, can you help us get us out of here.'' These troop extensions are really having an impact on the morale of our military men and women. 
   To add to that, soldiers see what has been going on at Walter Reed and they wonder whether they will be able to get the care they need. 
   The President has sent our troops into harm's way, extended their tours to support his surge, and has allowed these unforgivable lapses in the care of our wounded warriors under his watch. 
   When our men and women sign up for military service, recruiters assure them that the military will take care of them. The failure at Walter Reed calls the commitment given by our military recruiters into question. 
   The bill before us today will go a long way in making sure that the troops get the care they need and deserve. 
   I would like to thank my chairman, Mr. SKELTON, and all my colleagues for their work in developing this important legislation.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3021, a bill that will help our local schools build the high-quality classrooms that our students deserve. 
   This responsible legislation, which we will consider today, provides for needed investments in public school facilities, investments that will result in improved student performance. 
   Our Nation's public school facilities are in disrepair. This is a disgrace, and it impedes our students' ability to learn. Local education agencies want to make a difference, but they need our help. 
   With our younger students, we know that maintenance issues draw them away from focusing on what they need to focus on in the classroom, when they see chipping paint, water dripping from ceilings, poor heating and cooling. We need to change that. And older students cannot be prepared for the 21st Century if they don't have a 21st Century classroom. 
   These examples are not just anecdotal. There is firm evidence that suggests that we must invest in our school facilities in order to improve students' performance. By failing to do so, we are sending our youth a message that we don't care about them. 
   So I hope that my colleagues will vote with the best interests of our students and vote on this legislation in the affirmative today.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, today we have the opportunity to right a wrong, the President's wrong in vetoing SCHIP reauthorization. Rather than admit that this veto is in error, the Bush administration has embarked on this misinformation campaign. 
   This legislation does not expand SCHIP eligibility. It does not extend coverage to households with incomes up to $83,000 a year. It does not promote government-run health insurance. 
   Rather, this legislation has targeted uninsured American children living in poverty, children who already qualify for SCHIP but that don't have health care due to a lack of funding. 
   One of the most important reforms in this legislation is the creation of an incentive fund, a fund for States to enroll the 4 million children who currently are eligible for the program but are not enrolled. 
   Further, this legislation phases out the use of SCHIP funds to cover adults. Let's not forget it was the administration who allowed States to put adults into this program. Please, let's get this right. Override this veto.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2008 Authorization bill. 
   As the Vice Chair of the Homeland Security Committee I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important, bipartisan authorization bill that will provide much needed guidance to and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, and will be the first DHS Authorization bill voted on by the House. 
   H.R. 1684 contains many key provisions that will improve the Department's long range planning, accountability, personnel development. It will also provide long-neglected authorization for critical programs at the Department. 
   This legislation authorizes an Undersecretary for Policy and a Comprehensive Homeland Security Review at the start of each new Presidential Administration. 
   These provisions will help ensure that the Department is looking beyond the crisis at hand, planning for the future, and keeping its resources aligned with its mission and the National Strategy for Homeland Security. 
   In addition, I am pleased that this legislation includes a sense of the Congress that the consolidation of the Department's headquarters on the West campus of St. Elizabeth's Hospital should move forward rapidly. 
   I believe the establishment of this headquarters will have a positive effect on the efficiency, operations, and morale of the Department. 
   In terms of accountability, H.R. 1684 requires enhanced oversight of large contracts under the Department's Secure Border Initiative. 
   Personnel development is a major issue for the Department. This legislation authorizes expanded procurement training for acquisition employees; and enhanced incentives for the recruitment and retention of Border Patrol agents. 
   The bill also addresses several key policy areas. These include requiring the Department to plan for the implementation of the biometric exit component of the US-VISIT program. 
   This is an essential border security issue that will enable us to know who is in the country, and to better track people overstaying their visas. 
   In addition this legislation provides five year authorization of the Metropolitan Medical Response System, a critical program to ensure response capabilities for all-hazards mass casualty events. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1684, and in working together to have a Homeland Security Authorization bill signed into law this year for the first time ever.

   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. 
   Now you can imagine how Democrats felt when the Republicans hijacked the whole idea of putting benefits into Medicare for prescription drugs. Not only did they do a bad job with the regular program with the doughnut hole  and higher prices, but on top of that, they added two additional things. 
   One, they made criminals of people who would go to Canada or Mexico to get the same drugs for lower prices because, of course, our pharmaceutical companies charge the highest price for drugs right here in the United States. 
   Secondly, they prohibited the United States Government from doing what all other health plans do: negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the people who are in their health care program. 
   Well, guess what? Today we will right that. Today we will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate on behalf of Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I rise today as a cosponsor of H.R. 2956, and although I support this resolution, I must express my sadness that it has come to this point. 
   This President was wrong when he claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He has had over 4 years. He has asked for more time, for more troops, for more surges. And regardless of what our military experts and our troops on the ground say, this President continues to claim that we are winning the war in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, what reports are you reading? Whom are you listening to? Certainly not the reports that I have read or the military officials I have spoken to, who tell a very different story about what is happening in Iraq. To me it is with sadness that this Congress has to tell you that your war in Iraq is a failure and that we will not let you leave our brave men and women over there when you have no plan to allow them to succeed. We will not let them be targets any longer. 
   History will show, Mr. President, that your war was a failure. But today the Congress stood up to you and said enough is enough.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on  Homeland Security and a conferee on this legislation, I rise in strong support of the Conference report on H.R. 1, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. 
   This report implements several of the 9/11 Commission's key recommendations, including increasing the amount of Homeland Security grant funding that is distributed based on risk. 
   This extremely important change will ensure that the states at the highest risk for terrorist attacks will have the needed resources to prepare for and respond to attacks. 
   I am also particularly pleased that this report increases the authorized funding for the Emergency Management Performance Grant program which provides all hazards preparedness funding to States. 
   I have been a long-time advocate of increasing EMPG funding, to ensure that all of our communities have the ability to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made. 
   There are many other excellent provisions in this conference report, including the establishment of an office of appeals and redress at TSA and a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review of the national Homeland Security Strategy. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF A NATIONAL CHILD AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to recognize the many charities across this nation that serve children, and to support H. Res. 1296. 
   Declaring September as National Child Awareness Month will provide an excellent collaborative opportunity for children's charities and youth-serving organizations by bringing national attention to issues of vital concern to our children such as education, healthcare, social service, active living, arts and character development. 
   Children's charities and youth-serving organizations come in all shapes and sizes from the Boys and Girls Club to the Saint Joseph Ballet in Santa Ana, California. However, no matter the size, their mission is to improve the lives of the children they serve. 
   The enhanced awareness of children's charities and youth-serving organizations, that will be made possible by this resolution, will assist these organizations' efforts to raise needed funding and to encourage volunteers to become involved in the lives of the most disadvantaged children in their communities. 
   This Congress has made many symbolic gestures in support of children in the past. It is my hope that this resolution will have a greater impact resulting in the official declaration of September as National Child Awareness Month.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1089, which I introduced on Tuesday, calling for an end to the Vietnamese Government's imprisonment, detention and harassment of those who signed the Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy For Vietnam. 
   On April 8, 2006, 118 Vietnamese citizens signed a manifesto in support of peaceful action to bring democracy and basic human rights to the Vietnamese people. Thousands of Vietnamese people have since signed this document, refusing to be silent while their government continues to violate their human rights. In retaliation, the Government of Vietnam has jailed, detained and harassed those brave people. 
   I introduced this important resolution to mark the 2-year anniversary of the original signing of the manifesto and to highlight the ongoing human rights atrocities in Vietnam. 
   Not only does my resolution call on the Government of Vietnam to release peaceful advocates, but it also asks our State Department to establish a list of Countries of Particular Concern based on human rights violations, which would hold nations like Vietnam accountable.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor of H. Res. 593, a resolution congratulating the scientists whose work led to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. 
   The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty that has been a critical part of the global commitment to improving the environment for ourselves and future generations. The treaty was a science driven effort to address a specific human action that has real consequences on the ozone layer. 
   Yesterday, September 16th was the 20th anniversary of when the Montreal Protocol was first made available for signature. Although the benefits of the Montreal Protocol are being realized worldwide, the science that led to its implementation is entirely homegrown. 
   In 1973, scientists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina began their work at the fantastic University of California, Irvine, in Orange County, California. Rowland and Molina researched the depletion of stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbon gases. These CFC gases were used worldwide in many products as refrigerants and aerosol propellants. Like all scientific endeavors, Rowland and Molina started with a hypothesis. They realized that CFCs are very stable compounds in the lower atmosphere. Because of that, the compounds could travel to the upper atmosphere and interact with other compounds that are critical to the upper atmosphere. 
   By June of 1974 the hypothesis of Rowland and Molina was confirmed by their own research; CFCs are broken down by ultra-violet radiation in the upper atmosphere and then interact with and deplete ozone molecules. Their work was published in the scientific journal Nature to a mixed reaction because CFCs were considered by many to be a wonder product that had many benefits and no negative consequences. However, a mixed reaction to a published article is not necessarily a bad thing since it is necessary for published scientific work to hold up under intense peer review and scrutiny. 
   The National Academy of Sciences began testing the work of Rowland and Molina and by 1976, the Academy released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis. To the credit of this institution, Congress acted quickly in response to the confirmed work of Rowland and Molina. 
   In 1978 the use of CFCs in aerosol propellants was banned in the United States. With the United States leading the way and significant studies being conducted by the Dutch scientist Paul Crutzen, the Montreal Protocol came into full force on September 17, 1987. To date, 191 nations have signed on to the Montreal Protocol. 
   In 1995, Rowland, Molina, and Crutzen were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in recognition of their work--this was quite an achievement for UC Irvine as well. On the twentieth anniversary of the Montreal Protocol, let's once again recognize the homegrown science of Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina, and Paul Crutzen that has had an ongoing and significant positive impact on the Earth's ecosystem. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 593.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak today on this issue of the Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007. 
   As you know, I represent the largest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam in the world, and so I've had the chance to visit Vietnam now three times. Actually, I just finished visiting in April of this year. Before that, I had been denied a visa to visit Vietnam for three times in the past 2 1/2 years. 
   Now, I rise today in support of my colleague's House Resolution 3096, because this is a very critical time in our relationship with Vietnam. 
   Before being accepted in the World Trade Organization in January, the Government of Vietnam assured the world that they would make significant progress in the area of human rights, things that we, as Americans, really sometimes take for granted; freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of collective bargaining, freedom to assemble as we wish, and most importantly, really one of the reasons our country was founded, freedom of religion. 
   As my colleague from New Jersey stated, we had put Vietnam on the List of Particular Concern with respect to the infringement on religious beliefs of the people of Vietnam, and even they were taken off in anticipation of this issue of going into the WTO. Many, many promises in the 11 years that I have served in the Congress, many, many promises by the communist Government of Vietnam, yet nothing ever holds up. And in this particular case, every person who has stood up to speak inside of Vietnam for democracy, for democracy, for something other than the communist party, for free elections, for return of land confiscated by that government, for their ability to practice the religion that they want, for their ability to assemble three or four or five on a street corner with a simple sign, asking, wanting, searching for democracy. And each and every one of these people are under house arrest, have been put in prison. One of them, Father Ly, for example, was given a trial, a trial that lasted one day, no attorney available to him, in a very famous photograph sent across the world of the communist government with their hand over his mouth at his very own trial because they didn't want him to be heard by the world. 
   The venerable Thich Quang Do, a Buddhist, through peaceful means saying we need religious freedom, recognize the church where most of the Buddhists in Vietnam want to belong. But nothing. Instead, he is under house arrest. All of these dissidents, and yet they continue to speak up and try to tell the world that there is no human right in Vietnam. And they continue to fight. 
   Many of my colleagues on the other side and on our side of the aisle have been working to get this message out. So then they got WTO, and they imprisoned everybody. I was there in April. There were no dissidents to meet. I asked to go to the prisons. I asked to go see those who had been put behind bars. They laughed. They would not let me. They said, How dare you ask. You know better than to ask to see these people. And our ambassador, at his residence there, put together a tea of the wives and the mothers of the dissidents, not people who had spoken up, simply because they were married and these women were worried about their husbands. And they came to talk to us. They were stopped at their homes. They were barricaded in their homes. The streets were barricaded to their homes so they couldn't get out. And the two who made it, now in a very famous video playing on the Internet, as I came to the home, so did those women, the two who got through. And about 25 communist government soldiers descended upon us, pulling us apart and dragging away one of the women. The ambassador came out. He said these women are simply here to come and have tea with us. But they would have none of it. This is democracy? These are the human rights that this government promised? 
   So I say today, let us not be conspirators with this government in the backslide of progress. Please, I ask my colleagues, join us in voting for this resolution today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the House-Senate compromise language for the FY09 National Defense Authorization Act. I am happy that the House and Senate were able to come to an agreement to provide critical support to our Armed Forces. 
   I am particularly pleased that a number of provisions that I advocated for are in this final language. These provisions include the establishment of a Sexual Assault Database to provide a centralized, case-level database of information about sexual assaults that involve service members. I am also proud that my colleagues supported my efforts to require the Department of Defense to conduct a study of its bandwidth needs in the near and long term. Ensuring adequate bandwidth is essential to the military's ongoing readiness. 
   This bill takes critical steps to restore the readiness of our Armed Forces by providing an equipment reset of $8.6 billion for the Army and $1.8 billion for the Marine Corps. It also ensures full utilization of our depots in the future. 
   There are also a number of provisions to protect our service members in the battlefield. These include $1.7 billion for MRAP vehicles for our troops overseas and authority for the Department of Defense to conduct oversight and testing of personnel protective equipment. 
   In addition, this bill prohibits increased premiums and co-pays for TRICARE recipients and provides tuition assistance and training for military spouses. This bill also establishes a task force on suicide prevention and authorizes $3.2 billion to expand quality family housing. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation and I urge the other body to move quickly to pass this compromise language that will continue to prepare, support and protect our Armed Forces. Thank you and I yield back.

<DOCNO>Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 700, Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, a reauthorization of a Pilot Program for Increasing Usable Water Supply. As you well know, this Pilot Program for increasing usable water supply was authorized for 2002 through 2004, but the previous majority never appropriated any funds and let the authorization expire. 
   I want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues just how important it is to supplement existing water supplies by providing reliable high-quality sources of water, particularly in areas of the country that are under the threat of the desert. In California, especially in Orange County, the population is increasing; so is the need for water. 
   For over 15 years, the Orange County Water District has maintained a Groundwater Replenishment System designed to reuse advanced treated wastewater to recharge the County's groundwater aquifers and basin. This will help them meet the annual water needs of over 144,000 families that keep growing. Also, the county is barely 3 miles from the coast and has an added need to protect the Basin  from further degradation due to seawater intrusion. To this end, the OCWD under its Phase I project provides over 72 million gallons of water per day to replenish its aquifers as well as protect them from seawater intrusion by pumping water through injection wells. This phase will end in September, 2007. 
   In Phase II of the project, they will be able to process over 250 million gallons of wastewater per day and have enough to support the recharge effort and combat seawater intrusion. There are currently 30 such injection wells that can pump water up to 60-100 feet depth. 
   The beauty of this project is the collaboration the Water District has with the County's Sanitation District (OCSD) who provides the wastewater that would have been pumped out to the ocean thereby which would have deprived the Water District of the water that is now being reclaimed for the replenishment of groundwater aquifers. And the State Health Department provides the oversight, to make sure water quality is maintained. 
   With projects like this, communities such as Orange County will benefit tremendously. This OCGW project has attracted experts in public water management systems from other States and countries (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who come to Orange County to look at this tertiary system and learn from it. So, this is of national and even internatIonal significance. Also, projects like the OCGWR provides for the necessary investments to ensure water security for the future. 
   This bill will help improve water availability and quality by authorizing a total of $125 million to fund projects that increase usable water supply by encouraging innovation in water reclamation, reuse and conservation. The Orange County Water Reclamation Project is a perfect example of such a project and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 700.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA T. SANCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6045, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2008. 
   Bulletproof vests and body armor have saved thousands of law enforcement officers since the introduction and improvement of bulletproof material. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program provides our brave law enforcement officers with the vital equipment they need to save lives in the line of fire. 
   This grant program was created in 1999 by the Department of Justice to provide protection to state, local and tribal law enforcement officers by assisting officers in purchasing the protective equipment they need. 
   Since its inception, the grant program has purchased more than 1.5 million bulletproof vests for over 40,000 jurisdictions in the United States. In 2007 alone, the program provided $28.6 million to state and local law enforcement agencies across America and purchased over 180,000 new bulletproof vests. 
   In my district, this grant program has awarded more than $45,000 to law enforcement officials in the cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana. As a result, these cities were able to purchase more than 400 vests for their officers. 
   I am pleased that the House of Representatives is acting to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program for another three years. 
   Brave law enforcement officers risk their lives on a daily basis to protect our communities, and this grant program ensures that their communities can help protect them.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, the situation in the housing market is well documented. 
   Unscrupulous practices by mortgage brokers in search of fees and the unrealistic belief that housing prices would continue their meteoric rise is resulting in the most perilous situation for the housing sector, and the economy as a whole since the Great Depression. 
   The most urgent action for this Congress is to encourage actions that enable families to stay in their homes. 
   Today we will consider H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. This bill takes the crucial step to restore fundamental fairness for homeowners in financial distress by revising language in the tax code that includes discharged home mortgage debt as taxable income. 
   Homeownership, especially among minorities, is at an all time high. It has contributed greatly to our economy and our social fabric. Foreclosed, empty homes only impose costs that everyone must bear. 
   Now is the time to make sensible reforms to protect families and consumers who are on the verge of losing their home. 
   I commend the Committee on Ways and Means and the House Leadership for bringing this important bill to the floor.
