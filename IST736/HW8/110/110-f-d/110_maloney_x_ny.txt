<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MINIMUM WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, millions of workers will be getting a much-deserved raise. 
   In the first 100 days of this New Direction Congress, we voted to raise the wage floor for workers nationwide. Today, the Federal minimum wage goes to $6.55 per hour. This raise was long overdue. 
   Prior to passage of this legislation, the minimum wage had sunk to its lowest point in over half a century. Most minimum wage workers are adults, many of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families. 
   Families are being squeezed by the rising costs for basic necessities and wages that are failing to keep pace. I call this economy the stag-gas-food-lation economy; stagnant wages, many workers have lost up to $1,200 since this administration took office; rising gas and food prices; and now inflation.  
   Today's raise in the minimum wage provides an important boost for the millions of workers who have been left behind in this administration's economy.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlemen for yielding the time, and I appreciate their leadership. 
   Madam Speaker, today we will vote on an important bipartisan achievement, an economic stimulus package that is truly timely, temporary and targeted. Under the plan, more than 100 million families squeezed by the high cost of basic living expenses will get a meaningful tax rebate, and it is targeted to those families most in need. Millions of families can get help to avoid losing their homes, and small  businesses can take advantage of tax cuts that will help spur investment and job creation. 
   This package will provide a boost to the economy by putting hundreds of dollars into the hands of middle and lower income families who will generate demand without the fear of igniting inflation. 
   Our plan also temporarily raises the mortgage lending limits for FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to increase affordable refinancing options for those facing foreclosure and to inject much needed liquidity into the housing markets. 
   I regret that many of the aspects of the FHA reform were cut out of the bill, and we hope to have them passed in the Senate. These efforts build on the hard work of Democrats in Congress to help families stay in their homes and to prevent other crises like this from happening in the future. 
   This package is an important first step, but there is much more to do. We will keep fighting to restore the American Dream and to help America's hardworking families.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank our chairman for his heroic leadership on this, along with the New York delegation, GARY ACKERMAN, and many, many others. This is an absolutely necessity for New York City and for our country and for our economy. 
   After 9/11, I have never seen this body so united and determined, and I thank you for all of your help. But by far, the most important action by this Congress was enacting TRIA. Before TRIA, we could not even build a Popsicle stand in lower Manhattan. No one could build anything. Critical to our economic recovery was the passage of this Federal backstop, and I implore my colleagues to join the leadership, Mr. Frank and others, in passing this. 
   They say it is not needed, but I hear from businesses in New York they cannot get insurance. Some have gone to Lloyd's of London. They get insurance policies that say you have this policy on the condition that TRIA is reauthorized. This is critically important. 
   And I would like to stress to my colleagues that a very important part of our homeland security is our economic security. TRIA not only helped the rebuilding of New York City, it created jobs and helped America's economy grow despite the continuing terrorist threats against the United States. 
   TRIA has no cost to the taxpayer unless there is a terrorist attack. And in that terrible event, if it happens, and I hope it doesn't, TRIA saves the government money by structuring what would otherwise be hastily drafted emergency spending. Of course, setting up a public/private partnership to provide insurance coverage is more cost-effective than throwing money at the disaster after the fact.  
   So this is very important. I would like to be associated with the comments of my colleagues Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Frank on the reset and the need for long-term planning, 15 years. I thank my colleagues for your help after 9/11. Give our economy help now. Vote for this.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. This amendment effectively guts a provision of this bill which is essential for the recovery of localities that are the subject of terrorist attacks. 
   As we know in New York, insurance companies are reluctant to write coverage at all for sites of terrorist attacks because they find the risk of another attack too high given the deductible under TRIA. Insurance companies aren't willing to pay the higher deductible more than once, in other words, for any given site. We in New York face this problem today as there is far less coverage available for lower Manhattan than is required, but this problem will confront any locality that is the subject of an attack. 
   The reset mechanism in the bill solves this problem by lowering the deductible for any locality that has been the subject of a significant attack. It applies nationally and will greatly help with economic recovery by helping to provide adequate terrorism insurance. 
   We have worked on a bipartisan basis to make sure this reset mechanism works for the whole Nation, for industry, for policy holders and that it is fiscally responsible. 
   This amendment guts the reset mechanism by mandating large and rapid increases in the deductible once it resets to a lower number after a large terrorist attack. 
   Under this amendment, the reset deductible could rise in a short time to as high as 19 percent, which is almost the same as the original deductible of 20 percent. This defeats the purpose of the reset mechanism, which we worked so hard to craft as a balanced and effective tool.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this very important rule, and I rise in strong support of the rule and for the underlying bill, a housing stimulus package that will provide real relief for struggling homeowners and will bring certainty to the markets. 
   We are at a critical juncture in the subprime mortgage crisis. All of the data we have clearly demonstrate the severity of the problem. We have seen the perfect storm of stagnant wages, rising mortgage payments, and decreased home values, all of which have led to a record level of delinquencies and foreclosures. One recent study by the Pew Charitable Trust has found that one in two New York homeowners is projected to face foreclosure, primarily in the next 2 years, due to the subprime crisis. 
   This same study documents the ripple effect this crisis is having on our entire economy. Their analysis found that 52 percent of all homeowners will likely feel the ripple effect of foreclosures from the subprime loan crisis. Communities are negatively affected as foreclosures drive down home prices overall, diminishing homeowners' equity in entire neighborhoods. Costs also accrue to our local government in the form of lost tax revenue and direct expenses for securing, policing, and disposing of abandoned properties. 
   This is why this housing stimulus package is so terribly important. This is a well-crafted package which includes an expanded FHA Refinance Program totaling $300 billion. This voluntary program would permit FHA to provide up to $300 billion in new guarantees to help refinance at-risk borrowers into viable mortgages. 
   The only way we are going to solve this problem is through a multi-prong strategy. We have fully engaged the regulators, industry is working with homeowners; but we also need sound public policy that allows for many of these unaffordable subprime loans to be refinanced into viable mortgages homeowners can afford. 
   Another key part of this package includes the FHA and GSE modernization bills which we have already passed in this House but has yet to pass the Senate. The FHA bill will modernize the program opening it up to new homeowners and providing opportunities for long-term fixed mortgages. The modernized FHA will be the new financing option of many previous subprime borrowers, and it will be done in a way to ensure borrowers are receiving viable and affordable loans. The GSE bill will provide for a strong dependent regulator for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the 12 Federal home loan banks. 
   Again, this is a well-crafted package. I ask permission to revise and extend to include all of the important parts of this package. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this underlying bill.  
   I rise in support of a housing stimulus package that will provide real relief for struggling homeowners and will bring certainty to the markets.

It will also enhance Freddie and Fannie's mission to provide affordable housing. This bill will also make permanent the increased loan limits passed as part of the economic stimulus package. This increase is incredibly important in high-cost areas such as New York City in ensuring these products are available to our constituents. 
   Again, this is a well crafted package and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 294, high speed rail, incredibly important in Amtrak.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 294, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. As a New Yorker, I strongly support making travel easier, safer, and more affordable for my constituents and for all Americans who choose this method of travel. This bill mandates that preference be given to rail projects that have high levels of projected ridership and punctuality which will include the development of a high speed rail project between Washington and New York City. S. 294 serves to improve not only the quality of service on the most popular rail line in the country, but also will increase the availability and accessibility of mass transit to individuals. In this era of skyrocketing energy costs and global warming, encouraging the development of efficient mass transit options is very important to improve our economy and protect our environment. 
   As a frequent Amtrak user, I know how important it is for rail service in the Northeast Corridor to be in a constant state of ``good repair.'' I am sure that thousands of my fellow passengers, men and women traveling for business or personal reasons on this popular railway also will appreciate this requirement.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MONEY SERVICE BUSINESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4049, the Money Service Business Act, is bipartisan legislation that has been cosponsored by the chairman and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, as well as the ranking member of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, Congresswoman Biggert. This bill passed out of the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous vote. 
   The Money Service Business Act addresses the critical problem of money service businesses, MSBs, being denied access to the banking system. MSBs have experienced blanket terminations of their commercial accounts over the past several years due, in part, to banks responding to unclear guidance from regulators. 
   This bill establishes a mechanism that would allow MSBs to self-certify their compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, while allowing banks to make risk-based decisions about banking particular MSBs. 
   MSBs, which include check cashers, money transmitters and money order issuers, have served our Nation's community for years. If this issue is left unaddressed, the viability of MSBs will be compromised, potentially pushing many of these transactions underground and potentially untraceable to law enforcement. 
   Banks, reacting to regulatory fears, have terminated MSBs accounts in a blanket fashion in an attempt to minimize exposure to ``high risk'' businesses. Without a banking relationship, MSBs are unable to provide financial services to communities, making it difficult for millions of Americans to pay bills, send money, or cash checks. 
   Federal regulatory agencies, recognizing the problem facing MSBs, have sought to address this issue through agency guidance and regulatory changes, with little effect. This legislation addresses this problem by enabling MSBs to self-certify their compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements. 
   This approach is not novel. It is similar in principle to that used for international correspondent banking. It would not relieve banks of their due diligence responsibilities with regard to their MSB customers, rather, it would permit appropriate reliance on self-certification to relieve banks of being the de facto regulators only of MSBs' Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance. 
   The mechanics of this self-certification will be handled by regulations set forth by the Secretary of the Treasury, and the certification will be filed with the financial institution where the MSB has a commercial account. To ensure that there is appropriate access to these self-certifications, it has been requested that the Secretary of the Treasury, while promulgating the regulations to implement this legislation, should require a duplicate copy of the self-certification to be filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, and that the Department of Justice have access to these files. I am fully in support of this suggestion and believe it will allow for even greater transparency in the self-certification process. 
   I do want to mention that even with the implementation of the self-certification, MSBs would continue to be responsible for complying with all other existing provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and will continue to be the subject of rigorous on-site examinations by IRS examiners. 
   MSBs are also State regulated in many jurisdictions. Currently, 28 States and the District of Columbia require MSBs to be licensed and/or regulated by State banking agencies. Both MSBs and the financial institutions banking them will still be required to fully comply with all other aspects of the Bank Secrecy Act, including the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports and Currency Transaction Reports. Any violation of their certification would render the same civil and criminal penalties provided for by the Bank Secrecy Act and the anti-money laundering provisions. 
   This is a well-crafted bill that allows law enforcement to continue to track the transactions of money service businesses while allowing the MSBs to have access to the banking accounts they need to conduct business. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus,  and Financial Institution Subcommittee Ranking Member Biggert for their cosponsorship and support in bringing this important bill to the floor today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (34TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1974 ILLEGAL TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. As cochair and cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, I wish to extend my support to Cypriots of Hellenic descent here in our country, on Cyprus, and all around the world as we mark the tragic 34th anniversary of the 1974 illegal Turkish invasion of Cyprus. I have commemorated this day each year since I became a Member of Congress. 
   For the past several years, the Hellenic Caucus has been very engaged on the issues facing this divided island. Many members of the Caucus remain concerned about the continued occupation and division of the Republic of Cyprus. 
   Turkey illegally invaded Cyprus in 1974. As a result of the Turkish invasion and occupation, 160,000 Greek Cypriots, amounting to 70 percent of the population of the occupied area and over a quarter of the total population, were forcibly expelled from their homes, and approximately 5,000 Cypriots were killed. More than 1,400 Greek Cypriots, including four Americans of Cypriot descent, remain missing and unaccounted for since the Turkish invasion. 
   Famagusta was a thriving port city in Cyprus until 1974. Its industrial sector supplied vital jobs to the nearby population, and it was an important tourist destination. In 1973, 88 percent of all imports and 73 percent of all exports went through Famagusta. Tragically, a few short weeks after Turkey invaded Cyprus, Famagusta was bombed relentlessly by Turkish troops. I have many constituents that I represent who told me about that fateful day, how they had to crawl out on their hands and knees begging God for their life. They want desperately to return to their homes. 
   Many Greek Cypriots fled, as my constituents did, in terror, and the city was sealed off with barbed wire fences by Turkish forces. I have been to and seen the 113 miles of barbed wire, and we hope that this barbed wire will finally be removed. 
   Ultimately, 45,000 citizens of Famagusta became refugees in their own country, losing their land, businesses, homes and neighborhoods. Today, 34 years later, Turkey continues forcibly to occupy more than a third of Cyprus, with more than 43,000 illegal Turkish troops. 
   The peaceful and cooperative spirit and the person-to-person, family-to-family interactions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots is an encouraging sign for the successful reunification of Cyprus. However, it is time for Turkey to remove its troops from the island so that Cyprus can move forward as one nation undivided. 
   As a member of the European Union, Cyprus is playing a vital role in European affairs, while also strengthening relations with the United States. It has joined with us on issues important to our own security, including the fight against terrorism and other forms of international crimes. 
   Cyprus was the very first EU member to join the ship boarding protocol of President Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative, particularly important because Cyprus has one of the world's largest commercial shipping registries. 
   As Cyprus developed into a regional financial center, the government moved aggressively and put in place strong anti-money laundering legislation. On March 21, 2008, President Christofias and Turkish-Cypriot leader Talat agreed to establish working groups and technical committees as a stipulation in the July 8, 2006 agreement for which the House of Representatives expressed its full support by passing H.R. 405 last year. 
   On April 3, 2008, the Ledra Street crossing point opened. I have introduced legislation which expresses the strong support of the House of Representatives for the positive actions by the Republic of Cyprus aimed at opening additional crossing points along the cease-fire line, thereby contributing to efforts for the reunification of the island. 
   I strongly support legislation introduced by my colleagues, including H.R. 1456, introduced by Congressman Pallone, which would enable U.S. citizens who own property in the Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus to seek financial remedies with either the current inhabitants of their land or the Turkish Government. 
   I strongly support H.R. 620, introduced by my good friend, Representative Sires, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Turkey should end its military occupation of the Republic of Cyprus.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (BUSH ECONOMIC RECORD -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the President says his policies are working to make the economy strong and that all Americans are benefiting. But evidence of a slowing economy is building, and anxiety over the state of the economy remains high. 
   The credit crunch, the worsening housing slump, market volatility and weak consumer confidence point to a gathering storm that could drag down the economy, taking thousands of American jobs with it. 
   Risks in the housing market and weak business investment point to the growing uncertainty of which way the economy is heading. We are facing a tsunami of defaults and foreclosures in the subprime market which could have broader implications for the overall economy. 
   RealtyTrac reported that foreclosures in August increased 36 percent since July and 115 percent since this time last year. Expectations are that the next 18 months will be even worse as many subprime loans reset to higher rates. 
   The ability of American consumers to keep spending may be flagging with the cooling housing market. Consumer spending has been propping up the economy, but high energy prices and a worsening housing slump could force consumers to cut back, putting the economy at even greater risk. 
   American families are understandably worried about the future because the economy is weakening even before many have shared in the gains from the economic growth we have seen so far. 
   Employee compensation has lagged far behind productivity in this recovery. Some workers are beginning to see some gains in their paychecks after inflation, but they still have a great deal of lost ground to make up. Median family income has actually fallen by nearly $1,000 since President Bush took office. 
   The divergence between the ``haves'' and the ``have nots'' in the Bush economy stands in marked contrast to the second term of the Clinton administration when real wage gains were strong up and down the wage ladder, to the wealthy, to the poor, to the middle class. 
   And our economic foundation is simply not on solid ground. The administration is responsible for the three largest budget deficits on record, including a $413 billion deficit in 2004. The gross Federal debt is now almost $9 trillion, or my colleagues listening tonight, each of us owes $29,000 per person. Every citizen in America owes $29,000 to the Federal debt. 
   Our current account deficit with the rest of the world, the broadest measure of our trade deficit, rose to a record smashing $856 billion in 2006, the largest ever in the history of our country. The amount of Federal debt owned by foreigners has more than doubled under President Bush, with Japan and China alone holding nearly half of our $2.2 trillion debt. We have become a Nation of debtors vulnerable to the economic and political decisions made half a world away. 
   Despite 4 years of economic expansion, job growth has been modest. Wages are barely keeping pace with inflation. Employer-provided health insurance coverage is declining, and private pensions are in jeopardy. These are the economic barometers that matter most to American families. 
   Democrats in Congress are taking action to restore a sense of economic security to the middle class and ensure long-term economic growth for our Nation. We started by presenting a realistic budget plan that adheres to PAYGO principles for bringing down the deficit but that does not shortchange our national defense or our citizens. We are not going to spend money we do not have. 
   Our priorities include providing health care for millions more uninsured children as we did tonight, adding 10 million uninsured children, providing coverage for them, making investments in veterans' benefits, and restoring crucial funding for first responders and local law enforcement. 
   In order to spur innovation that will keep America number one, Democrats will increase funding for cutting-edge research, invest more in math and science education, and make college more affordable. 
   We also have a plan to expand renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce global warming and dependence on foreign oil. 
   And Democrats want to bring tax relief to those who need it most, by shielding 19 million middle-income American families from the alternative minimum tax. 
   Mr. Speaker, after 6 years of irresponsible policies, Democrats are working hard to get our economic house back in order.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, every month this year the Bush administration and the Bush economy has shed more jobs than it has produced, leaving millions of American workers competing against each other for the remaining jobs. We haven't seen this many people enter unemployment so quickly in over three decades. 
   Today, the House will consider providing up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits to workers who have exhausted the 26 weeks of regular benefits. The bill will provide relief to American families struggling through these tough economic times. 
   Unemployment benefits are also important to economic recovery, with absolutely every dollar of the benefit checks going right back into the economy. And while the economy continues to weaken and costs for gasoline and food skyrocket every day, the need for government help is clear. 
   Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues continue to oppose these efforts to assist millions of out-of-work Americans, even though they supported a similar extension in 2002, when job loss numbers were not nearly as bad as they are today. 
   Mr. Speaker, as our economy continues to face tough times, Washington should explore every possible option to help those struggling. That is exactly what Democrats will do today in Congress, extend those benefits.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in the last 2 weeks, we have seen a tsunami of foreclosures and turmoil in the subprime markets. The Federal regulators' recent joint guidance to stop issuance of loans that borrowers can't repay in full is a good first step, but lenders won't make bad loans if no one will buy them. The secondary market must stop buying the loans causing this crisis. 
   Freddie Mac did this voluntarily, and I am introducing legislation to require all the housing GSEs to do the same. In the interim, I call on Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Banks to follow Freddie Mac and stop buying these risky loans. Both Congress and the GSEs must act to protect homeowners and stabilize the system.

   We have made improvement over the years, and I am pleased to have been one of the authors of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act of 1996. This important law was intended to make FOIA more efficient by providing public access to information, including in an electronic format. 
   The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I am a member, has held many hearings on FOIA over the past few years, and we have learned that it has not progressed as well as we had hoped. Some agencies and Departments are doing a better job of fulfilling freedom of information requests, while some continue to have terrible records and lag far, far behind. Requesters often wait months or years to find out the status of their requests or to obtain the information. And I am pleased that we have report language that clarifies that they have to get back quickly on requests and at least let them know where they are. 
   As a result, the backlogs at agencies and Departments continue to grow, and frequently the only recourse for the denial of requested information is to file lawsuits. But many people, many Americans cannot afford the high costs associated with court costs. So by not moving in a timely manner, you are depriving them of this information. 
   H.R. 1309 includes many important provisions that my colleagues have spoken about and that I hope will improve the process and eliminate the problems that exist in today's system, including an amendment that I offered in committee that would provide for greater disclosure to the FOIA requester about the exemption under which a deletion has been made from requested material. 
   I often hear from constituents, they come to my office with piles of FOIA requests and like the whole thing is redacted and there is absolutely no explanation why. This is really not fair, and we hope that this amendment will improve the process. 
   I am pleased that it was accepted in a bipartisan way by Ranking Member Davis and Ranking Member Turner. I really feel this legislation is long overdue, and I commend Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis and Chairman Clay and Ranking Member Turner for bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor with the many other very important sunshine bills to make our government more open and accountable to the American public.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, as a cosponsor of this legislation, I rise in strong support of H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act. 
   I think one thing we can all agree on is that the current system is broken and whistleblowers are simply not being protected. 
   Too often our system retaliates against whistleblowers rather than thanking them for standing up for what is right. 
   The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has heard from many of them, including Sibel Edmonds, the former FBI Translator who was fired for raising concerns about the way the FBI was translating important information about our security. 
   Her reward for blowing the whistle included having her security clearance stripped, being fired from her job and being forced to endure a years-long court battle that prevented her from any sort of normal life. 
   Things were so bad with her case that when she testified before the committee she literally could not tell us anything about her life--where she was born or which languages she speaks. 
   Sadly, she is not alone. 
   The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) has been weakened by court cases in recent years and even the weak protections offered under the WPA do not apply to national security whistleblowers or contractors at those agencies. 
   The Oversight Committee repeatedly has heard from people who have had their security clearances revoked after blowing the whistle. 
   We have been told that wrongdoers have been allowed to continue their actions while the whistleblower has been the one made to suffer. 
   In the 109th Congress I was joined by my colleague Representative Diane Watson in offering an amendment during the Committee's consideration of the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act that would have extended whistleblower protections to employees in national security and the intelligence community. 
   I am thrilled that this legislation will extend these important protections to employees of intelligence agencies and to federal contractors. 
   Passage of this bill is long overdue. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of the rule, H. Res. 239, and the underlying bill, H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. 
   And I want to commend, not only the Rules Committee for coming forward with a fair rule, but also Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for moving this important bill out of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee on which I serve. 
   The Whistleblower Protection Act has been weakened by court cases in recent years, and even the weak protections offered under the Whistleblower Protection Act do not apply to national security whistleblowers or contractors at those agencies. 
   The Oversight Committee repeatedly has heard from people who have had their security clearances revoked after blowing the whistle. In some cases they have been fired for pointing out lapses in security, for pointing out waste, fraud and abuse. 
   We have been told that wrongdoers have been allowed to continue their actions, while the whistleblowers have been the ones that have been made to suffer. This is absolutely wrong. 
   In the 109th Congress I was joined by my colleague, Diane Watson, in offering an amendment during the committee's consideration of the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act, that would have extended whistleblower protections to employees in national security and in the intelligence community. 
   I would argue, and I believe many of my colleagues would agree, that revealing lapses in the security of our  Nation is a national security priority above all. Whistleblowers in these categories should be protected. 
   And I am thrilled that, under Democratic leadership, this has been included in the bill, that these protections have been extended to employees of intelligence agencies, and to Federal contractors in intelligence agencies. This is an important step forward for the American public. This is an important step forward, I would argue, for the national security of our country. 
   Whistleblowers are heroes and heroines. They should not be turned into villains and be harassed out of their jobs, denied their security clearance because they see a breach in security or a breach in accountability in our government. 
   So I am thrilled with this Democratic bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and also for the underlying bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. It had bipartisan support coming out of our committee.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Lantos for his leadership on this important bill and in so many other areas; and I rise in strong support of the Afghan Freedom and Security Support Act. 
   The bill includes provisions from legislation that I introduced earlier this year, H.R. 937, the Afghan Women Empowerment Act, which targets critical assistance to Afghan women and girls. The bill authorizes $45 million each year from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 for programs in Afghanistan that benefit women and girls, as well as the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs. 
   The funding would be directed toward important needs, including medical care, education, vocational training, protection from violence and civil participation. 
   In 2003, I successfully attached, with the leadership and help of Chairman Lantos, an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 emergency supplemental bill that provided $60 million in funding for Afghan women and girls NGOs, including $5 million for the creation of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.     
   During the past several years, the U.S. has invested in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, both because it is the right thing to do and because it is also critical to our national security. However, like many of my colleagues, I am troubled by the challenges facing Afghani women. In March, I had the pleasure and on other occasions of meeting with Dr. Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. She says Afghan women are losing ground. Many women continue to endure hardships including targeted violence, limited mobility, and a high rate of maternal mortality. I am also deeply concerned about reports that girls schools continue to be targeted for violence, including dozens in this past year. 
   Clearly, we have a great deal of more work to do. And by giving women access to the skills and opportunities that they need, they will become partners in creating Afghanistan's future and we will ensure that women will no longer be second class citizens. 
   I deeply thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership in getting this important bill to the floor, and I also want to acknowledge Congress Member Abercrombie for his strong support for this legislation and his efforts on its behalf, along with the Feminist Majority, led by Ellie Smeal. 
   This legislation is another critical step in helping Afghan women, and I commend the House for passing this legislation today.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (PAY DISCRIMINATION -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to women pursuing pay discrimination claims. 
   For the majority of her 20-year career, Lilly Ledbetter was paid less than her male counterparts, including those with less seniority for doing the exact same work. By her own calculations, she was now being shortchanged by about $15,000 annually. 
   Her experience is, unfortunately, a common one. In the Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire, the Court ruled that she had missed her window of opportunity to file a claim covering the many years of discrimination she faced. 
   We need to close this loophole by making every pay period a new infraction. This way, employees can challenge unfair practices that persist over time but don't come to light for years later. 
   Inequality still exists. It is our job to fix it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my good friend's amendment. The census is critically important. It's even required in our Constitution. The importance of an accurate census cannot be overstated. The Founding Fathers of our country understood it; they wrote it right into Article I, section 2 of the Constitution. 
   It is very, very important for the reasons that Chairman Mollohan mentioned, but it's absolutely our constitutional obligation to conduct the census and to do it to the very best of our ability. 
   To delete very important programs that put together data on which we make decisions, policy decisions, in our country is extremely short-sighted. 
   I rise in strong opposition, not because I oppose the program it seeks to add funding to, but because I oppose the offset, the cut to the census. And I think that it's easy to say that programs that fight crime or aid local law enforcement need this money more than the census. On the surface the census does not seem to have the direct connection to public safety that some of these programs do.     
   What many people do not realize, however, is that local law enforcements rely on the Census every day and an inaccurate count could jeopardize their ability to fight crime. Our businesses rely on it. Our funding formulas are tied to it. 
   We are required to conduct the census every 10 years by our Constitution in order to have reapportionment. Our representation is tied to it. So when you cut the money to the Census, you are cutting representation. You are cutting accurate data so that we can make accurate decisions in this body. It is very short-sighted.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment, not because I oppose the program it seeks to add funding too, but because I oppose the offset. Every year we have the same fight to maintain funding for the Census Bureau. I don't know how many times I've had to come down here to try and explain how essential it is that we not cut funds for the Census Bureau. 
   The Census is the largest peacetime mobilization in history. It requires recruitment and training of over 500,000 enumerators and census workers, to count more than 300 million residents at 130 million unique addresses. All of this massive preparation takes place according to a strict, decade-long schedule. The closer we get to the decennial, the more important it is to adhere to that schedule. In 2008, there are two full dress rehearsals planned, one in California, and one in North Carolina. 
   Former Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt once said that it is difficult to do a really good census, but it is easy to do a bad one. If we cut funds to the Census Bureau, we will easily do a bad one. 
   Census as a Good Taxpayer Investment 
   The Federal government depends on census data in three important ways. First, to distribute funding through eligibility criteria and allocation formulas. 69.3% of the Federal grants given out in FY2004 (the most recent year that we have this data for) were allocated based on Census Bureau data. Second, census data are used to enforce Federal civil rights and anti-discrimination laws such as the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. Third, the Federal government uses census data to create models and estimates for various Federal programs, and to then evaluate their efficacy. 
   State and local governments use census data for different purposes. They allocate criminal justice resources based on crime maps and demographic profiles. They base disaster response plans on census data. They analyze their transportation systems using information from the Census Bureau. The list goes on. 
   Not only do governments of all levels rely on the census, but the private sector does as well. Businesses conduct market research based on census data. Hospitals identify their constituencies and how to better serve their needs based on census data. The real estate sector uses it to ....... 
   One can argue, therefore, that the census is essential not only to democracy, but to the U.S. economy as well. With so many governments and businesses who rely on data, it is absolutely essential that that data be accurate. 
   Over ten years, the 2010 census will cost approximately $11.5 billion. That's an average of $1.2 billion per year. Divide that by the population of the U.S., and the cost is approximately $4 per person, per year. Four dollars. That's it. I don't know about you, Mr. Chairman, but I am willing to spend $4 a year to ensure that Federal, State, and local governments, businesses and non-profits, all have accurate data to conduct their business. In fact, considering the enormous benefit that the economy gains by having an accurate census, I'm willing to wager that this is one of the most cost-effective uses of taxpayer dollars. I urge my colleagues to spend your constituents' tax dollars wisely by opposing any amendments that cut funding from the census.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, 4 years that have been difficult for our country, we have had to watch the administration bungle the war in Iraq in just about every way imaginable. As war became civil war in Iraq, we watched our colleagues on the other side of the aisle act as a rubber stamp for this misguided war while refusing to ask the pertinent questions, the questions we were asking, the questions the American people were asking. And we watched as 3,200 of our brave troops lost their lives in another country's civil war, while 24,000 came home with permanent injuries and billions upon billions of our taxpayers' dollars have been sunk into the quicksand Iraq has become. 
   This will be the case no more. 
   With the scores of oversight hearings our leadership has already conducted this year and now with this legislation, we are, for the first time, bringing accountability, timelines and end to the mismanaged war in Iraq. 
   Congress is no longer a rubber stamp. 
   The President has asked us time and again for money for this war without any strings. This, despite the fact that they let many of our troops go to battle without the proper equipment, and that they can't even account for $12 billion of taxpayer money for reconstruction. 
   With this bill, we will bring accountability as well as money for our injured soldiers who have been neglected. We are adding a total of $3.4 billion for the military health care system, including money to address the problems at Walter Reed and money for head injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   For 4 years, the administration's war policies have been risking lives and spending this country's treasure without any accountability. 
   This legislation will end the free ride and it will end the war. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (TO ELIMINATE THE EXEMPTION FROM STATE REGULATION FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES DESIGNATED BY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGES -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2868, bipartisan legislation that would enhance the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets by allowing exchanges to establish developmental tiers to expand listing opportunities in the U.S. for smaller companies. 
   H.R. 2868 would remove the barrier to creating developmental listing tiers on several of the major exchanges in the U.S. by amending Section 18 of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA). Under the bill, all securities listed on a developmental tier would be subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight and state blue-sky regulations in an effort to uphold investor protections. 
   Right now, the inability to develop an additional, developmental tier can be a significant impediment to an exchange's ability to compete in the global marketplace. These barriers make our markets less competitive for small cap listings and can drive companies to list outside the United States. 
   London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for example, is attracting capital worldwide and recruiting U.S. IPO's. According to a recent International Herald Tribune report, companies listed on London's AIM raised $30 billion in capital in 2006. The exchange has tripled its number of listed companies to 1,640 since 2000, with about one-third of them international. A total of 63 companies worth about $11 billion are from the United States--the highest representation on AIM.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. In the first 100 hours of this new Congress, the time finally has come to end the royalty rip-off, which has lined the pockets of Big Oil at the expense of the American taxpayers for entirely too long. For years, I have been working to ensure that Americans get what is owed to them from oil and gas companies through my work on the Government Reform Committee, scathing reports from the Government Accountability Office, and offering amendments here on the House floor. I am thrilled that we finally have the opportunity to give this issue the full attention it deserves. 
   It is indisputable that the American taxpayers are losing billions of dollars in royalties due to them by the oil and gas companies who are taking valuable resources out of Federal lands. The GAO estimates that because price thresholds were not included in deepwater leases from 1998 and 1999, the government has already lost up to $2 billion in royalties and could lose as much as $10 billion over the life of the leases. 
   H.R. 6 addresses the problem by requiring current offshore fuel producers with royalty-free leases to either agree to pay royalties when fuel prices reach certain thresholds or agree to pay a new ``conservation of resource fee.'' It would also close loopholes and end giveaways for Big Oil in the tax code and in the 2005 Energy Bill. 
   Together these savings would generate $14 billion to create a Created Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The majority of the American public support investing in alternative energy sources to end our addiction to oil, and even President Bush promised to invest in clean renewable fuels and cutting-edge technologies in his 2006 State of the Union Address. This clean energy fund will be used to pay for upcoming legislation to encourage people to use clean domestic renewable energy resources already in existence, promote use of energy-efficient products and practices, and increase research and development of new cutting-edge technologies. 
   Today, we must take the opportunity to show the American people that we are with them, not with Big Oil. H.R. 6 is an important first step towards a smart energy policy and a clean energy future, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his important leadership on this bill. 
   I rise in strong support of the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act. This bill was marked up earlier this month in the Financial Services Committee and was passed by a strong bipartisan vote. 
   I not only thank the chairman and Ranking Member Bachus, but Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Biggert. Chairwoman Waters led many hearings and meetings and conferences on this, going to New Orleans and Mississippi, meeting with the families, with the authorities, and working with really great devotion and determination to move this bill to the floor to help the people in the gulf region. 
   This bill is a victory for those people who have suffered so greatly not only through Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but an awe-inspiring amount of bureaucratic red tape, trying to get the help and the assistance that they need. 
   This bill will finally provide comprehensive housing relief for the hurricane-impacted areas of the gulf coast, and it will expedite and move forward and cut through the red tape so that the money and the services get to the people they were intended for. 
   It provides increased flexibility and oversight, while preserving Federal housing assistance and providing assistance to landowners and communities who helped evacuees. It provides flexibility by freeing up $1.2 billion in funds for Louisiana's Road Home program for which FEMA is currently withholding use by transferring the funds to the Community Development Block Grant account, and it eliminates an unnecessary restriction imposed by the prior Congress against CDBG funds being used to meet matching requirements under other Federal programs. 
   It increases oversight by requiring the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the entity that administers the Road Home program, to report on their progress every 30 days on exactly what they are doing to help the people.     
   It preserves Federal housing assistance by including a number of provisions to rebuild the stock of affordable housing and to ensure that the administration will not shrink the level of housing assistance that supports that housing stock. 
   It provides assistance to communities that assisted evacuees by authorizing reimbursement for communities that used their own CDBG funds to provide rental assistance to evacuees after the storms hit, and it also provides such reimbursement to landowners who assisted the people. 
   This is a good bill. It cuts through the red tape. It provides assistance to the people, and I congratulate all who worked on it, particularly the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. Waters.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6604, the Commodity Markets Transparent Accountability Act. 
   Before I outline my opposition to this legislation, I want to be clear that I am seriously concerned about the cost of oil and the cost Americans are paying at the pump. To this end, I have been proud to support a series of other bills that this House has considered to  help bring down the cost Americans are paying at the pump as well as efforts to create new alternative and renewable sources of energy. I have been a long-term supporter of reforming the royalties the oil and gas industry pays for the natural resources they extract from public lands. Last year I was proud to stand with my colleagues as we, for the first time in a generation, increased the fuel efficiency standards on cars sold here in the United States. Just yesterday, I was pleased to vote in favor of H.R. 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. The legislation is a bold step forward, helping end our dependence on foreign oil and increase our national security. It launches a clean renewable energy future that creates new American jobs, expands domestic energy supply--including new offshore drilling--and invents and builds more efficient vehicles, buildings, homes, and infrastructure. It will lower costs to consumers and protect the interests of taxpayers. It is a comprehensive strategy and the product of bipartisan compromise. 
   I want to be clear that I am completely opposed to energy manipulation, which is a crime, but what we are talking about here is the role of legitimate investors in the commodities market. To that end, my main concern with this legislation is that it would crack down on legitimate trading practices, resulting in the loss of American jobs. 
   Additionally, I am concerned that this legislation will significantly reduce liquidity in the U.S. futures and derivatives markets and drive trading overseas at a very precarious time for U.S. financial markets. This legislation also could create legal uncertainty and could also increase market disruption in the over-the-counter, OTC, markets. Moving this trading overseas and creating legal uncertainties could result in lost jobs here in the United States, especially for our constituents who work in these markets. At a time we are fighting to keep New York City and the United States as the financial capital of the world, any measure that could cost our economy quality jobs without providing any benefit in return is not a measure I can support. 
   Joining me in my skepticism that speculators have been able to manipulate the oil market is what many may consider an unlikely source, Paul Krugman of the New York Times. 
   In a May 12, 2008 column, titled ``The Oil Nonbubble'', Krugman writes: 
   ``The only way speculation can have a persistent effect on oil prices, then, is if it leads to physical hoarding--an increase in private inventories of black gunk. This actually happened in the late 1970s, when the effects of disrupted Iranian supply were amplified by widespread panic stockpiling. 
   But it hasn't happened this time: all through the period of the alleged bubble, inventories have remained at more or less normal levels. This tells us that the rise in oil prices isn't the result of runaway speculation; it's the result of fundamental factors, mainly the growing difficulty of finding oil and the rapid growth of emerging economies like China. The rise in oil prices these past few years had to happen to keep demand growth from exceeding supply growth.'' 
   To be clear, I stand ready to support legislation that will reduce the cost Americans are paying at the pump, and I am fully in support of efforts to create new, affordable and renewable energy options that will move us towards energy independence. However, this legislation, while certainly well intentioned, could potentially create more harm than good and lead to the loss of American jobs.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him so much for his leadership on this bill and so many other important issues to our State and country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for National Security FIRST, the underlying bill, and in strong support for the open rule that is before us. 
   Democrats have pledged a return to democracy on the floor of the House of Representatives with an open rule process, and I am very happy to support that pledge with a debate on my bill, H.R. 556. 
   As Congressman Dreier said last night in the Rules Committee, he said that this doubles the amount of times the Republicans allowed for an open rule on a legislative bill in the last Congress; of course this is legislative bills, not appropriations bills. And even though this bill has strong bipartisan support, we did get several amendments last night. 
   I appreciate deeply that Chairman Frank supported and called for an open rule, and that in addition he asked for and obtained a preprinting requirement, since the bill is complicated, and Members on both sides of the aisle need to have time to read the amendments and put them in context. 
   This is the second time this bill has come to the floor. It passed overwhelmingly last year, 421-0, and it is a sound bill that strengthens national security, while encouraging safe foreign investment that helps create American jobs. 
   I hope and expect that the bipartisan effort that got this bill passed in the last Congress will be here today, and I believe that this open rule reflects the spirit of our bipartisan work. 
   I would just like to point out that a year has passed since the Dubai World's fiasco, the scandal, and if you had told me that it would take a year to pass this bill, I would not have believed it. And I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share this sense of urgency to get this bill done. I am deeply grateful for their support. This is not a political issue; it deserves strong bipartisan support. Nothing is more important than our national security, our homeland security and promoting American jobs. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership. 
   I want to thank in particular Chairman Frank for making this bill, the National Security FIRST Act, a priority of this Congress. Democrats and Republicans have supported this bill, demonstrating a desire to enhance national security while avoiding a freeze of beneficial and safe economic investment in our country. 
   I would like to thank in addition my other Democratic colleagues, Luis Gutierrez and Joe Crowley, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Deborah Pryce, Roy Blunt and Ranking Member Bachus, for their continued support and leadership on this important legislation. 
   A year ago, Mr. Speaker, Americans woke up to find out that six of the largest ports in our Nation would be controlled by a foreign government, the United Arab Emirates, under the Dubai Ports World. Even worse, this deal had been approved by our government through a secretive process no one had ever heard of. In fact, Congress and senior administration officials learned about this deal by reading about it in the newspapers. 
   Even before the Dubai Ports World fiasco, the General Accountability Office had criticized the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, for being overly focused on bureaucratic goals, basically getting deals done with little oversight, without causing a fuss. 
   Well, the Dubai Ports World deal showed the world the weaknesses in the CFIUS process. The decision was  made, and when they did make that decision, they did not involve any high-level government officials. They did not report to Congress. They used a very out-of-date definition of national security. 
   Surely anyone in a post-9/11 world would consider our largest ports a national security concern. The 9/11 Commission called it one of the areas that we have the most problems and one that needs the most attention. 
   As a Representative from New York, which is both target number one for terrorism and the financial capital in our Nation, I felt very strongly that we needed to get something done. 
   At the time, along with Deborah Pryce, I was the ranking member on the subcommittee which we both served on with jurisdiction over CFIUS, and so we had a front-line responsibility for the issue, and we worked together to put forward this legislation. 
   Our legislation passed the last Congress 421-0. We hope we get the same result today, and we resubmitted the bill again earlier this year. It is past time to get this done. If you had told the American people that a year after Dubai Ports World and the scandal involved with it we would still be debating CFIUS reform and had not strengthened the system already, I think they would be very surprised. 
   The need for reform remains even after DPW. The CFIUS process is not catching all the deals that it should. 
   Last year I personally called to the attention of CFIUS the fact that a company with ties to the Venezuelan Government had purchased a major voting machine manufacturer in our country. CFIUS did initiate a review, and after some time in the process, the company announced that it would withdraw from the U.S. market. Surely we would consider a foreign government owning our voting machines a national security concern. 
   In the end the process did work, but it worked only after prodding, and it should work better. That is what this bill would accomplish. It puts national security first, addressing the weaknesses in the Dubai Ports World. 
   The bill requires high-level attention and sign-off on every transaction, and particular attention to transactions involving foreign-government-owned entities.     
   The bill also creates a formal role for the intelligence community and sets up an independent intelligence assessment. It requires a broad and flexible definition of national security that includes the concerns of 12 different agencies, and it sets up a system for monitoring deals that are withdrawn from the process. 
   The bill contains very tough provisions to protect national security, including the ability of CFIUS to reopen reviews when companies do not comply with mitigation agreements designed to reduce security risks. This is such a severe remedy that we have hedged it with many procedural protections, and we expect CFIUS to use it only in exceptional cases. 
   This bill also puts Congress in the picture, making sure that we learn about these deals from CFIUS, not from the newspapers but after the decisions have been made. And by providing greater certainty and predictability in the process, we can encourage foreign investors. I am glad he yielded me this time, because a very important part of CFIUS is we build in predictability and clarity for foreign investment, so that it is not gray, but black and white of where they can go to get a swift approval for safe foreign investment. 
   This is critical to our economy. Over 5.1 million jobs came into our economy from foreign investment in 2004, and there were 50,000 jobs recently created in New York City after 9/11 from foreign investment. It is very important to economic growth in our country. We want to encourage it, but at the same time, we want to protect our citizens, our number one responsibility. 
   Mr. Chairman, may I say to Ms. Pelosi, I appreciate your making this a priority and moving it to the floor so quickly. We will be able to work with our colleagues in the Senate to get a strong bill and pass it and sign it into law. I appreciate the support from the business community, the intelligence community, and from the executive office. 
   I request unanimous consent to place in the Record the statement from the Executive. 
   What can I say, it is a win-win situation. It is a bipartisan bill. Let's move forward and pass it and enact it into law.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Reclaiming my time, I will yield to the gentleman on his own time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The CFIUS process already requires comprehensive reporting to Congress on just about every factor conceivable that is relevant to the subject of national security and foreign direct investment. That is the purpose of this bill. 
   This is not the place to evaluate whether our tax or our regulatory system, our jobs should be changed to encourage foreign investment. That is not the purpose of this bill, and we cannot dress it up like a Christmas tree with all these other items. 
   I would suggest the gentleman put forward a stand-alone bill or address it in an economic development package, but that is not the purpose of this legislation.     
   The CFIUS process is put in place and should focus on national security. And while we value foreign investment, we certainly do not want CFIUS to be weighing the value of foreign investment, as per regulation or tax burden or jobs, against any national security risk. The primary purpose is national security. And if there are national security risks that cannot be fixed with an agreement, these transactions should not go forward, period. 
   I would like to add that the process that we have, the CFIUS process, requires annual reporting to a board setup of a committee on, among other things, all filings with CFIUS, details on the trends in filings, investigations, withdrawals, and Presidential decisions. It requires reporting on mitigation agreements and enforcement, the impact of foreign investment on critical infrastructure, critical technologies, and whether there is a coordinated strategy by one or more countries to acquire critical technologies in the United States. 
   But to force CFIUS to opine on policy matters outside of its mandate and expertise, CFIUS is not the right body to report on regulation matters or tax matters that the gentleman has put forward in his amendment, and this requirement will also distract CFIUS from focusing on its prime focus, which is protecting our American citizens, our national security first. 
   These are legitimate issues to raise, and I compliment the gentleman on his thoughtful research and concern, but this is not the area where it should be legislated. 
   So I join the chairman in strongly urging a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I join Chairman Frank and my colleague from New York in stressing that the CFIUS process is first and foremost for national security, and to give clear guidelines and predictability to foreign businesses to invest in America. 
   The CFIUS process is supported, if the gentleman is concerned about jobs and the private sector, this is supported almost unanimously by the business sector of our country. They have come out, a whole list of groups, supporting this well-balanced legislation and have called upon it not to be dressed up like a Christmas tree. My other colleague said this did not dress it up like a Christmas tree, yet it is adding unrelated items to the bill. We have bills on commerce, we have bills on education, we have bills in other areas, and that is where this should be discussed. 
   Foreign investment is very important to our country. It provides 5.1 million American jobs, $1.9 trillion in equity investment; and some 50,000 jobs in New York City are created at this point by foreign investment. But not one of these jobs or dollars is worth risking our national security. That is why we have CFIUS. We do not want to risk our national security for any job, and we have a template, we have a procedure placed in the CFIUS process for direct, safe foreign investment. 
   I join my colleague in opposing this amendment.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, last night when Congress passed its year-end spending bill, our Nation took another step forward in caring for the heroes and heroines of 9/11. 
   By including $108 million for the health needs of the World Trade Center first responders, residents, students, and others exposed to the deadly toxins at Ground Zero, we again show that we will not turn our backs on those who came to New York from every single State in our Nation to help in the aftermath of 9/11. 
   And in the new year, I look forward to continuing to build support for the bipartisan 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which I introduced with my colleagues Jerry Nadler, Vito Fossella, and George Miller. 
   Caring for the heroes and heroines of 9/11 is our duty. They were there for us, we were there for them last night in our budget, and we need to be there in the future. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support, especially for the leadership of Mr. Obey and Speaker Pelosi.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my colleague for his work on this bill. 
   The bill we are moving forward today is necessary, significant, and timely. There are few issues that are more important to our Nation's economy than a stable, long-term Federal support system for our terrorism risk insurance. 
   I am disappointed that this final TRIA bill omits key elements of our stronger House legislation, but this is a solid compromise law that will help stabilize the market and ensure the ongoing availability of affordable terrorism risk insurance. 
   TRIA keeps Americans working, even in the face of terrorist threats. It is a powerful statement of our determination to keep our markets open, our cities vibrant, and our productivity strong. 
   What markets hate most is uncertainty. This longer term bill will allow our economy to grow while protecting our economic security, which is an important part of our homeland security and our national defense. 
   I am delighted to see this bill on the floor. I thank Chairman Frank, the New York delegation, Ranking Member Bachus and many, many others for their support of this important legislation.  
   By renewing TIRA with a long-term extension we stand strong in our resolve not to allow terrorists to destroy our economy and our way of life. 
   That requires a Federal commitment to provide a backstop and cut off the tail of an otherwise almost infinite risk curve so that the private sector can plan and put in place a framework of insurance that protects all of us.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the administration's answer to record gas prices today is to allow drilling in Alaska's pristine wilderness and off our shorelines for little payoff a decade from now. 
   What they don't tell you is that big oil companies already lease 68 million acres of public lands that they are not developing. Big oil companies are sitting on 81 percent of America's Federal oil and gas reserves, but all they are producing are complaints that it's not enough. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6251--the ``use it or lose it'' bill. This legislation would compel the oil industry to start drilling on the acreage they already lease before obtaining any new leases. 
   Madam Speaker, if domestic drilling can bring relief to American families, what are the oil companies waiting for?

   His cross-country journey started in New York just after the sixth anniversary of 9/11. It continued through Washington, DC, in early October where he met with Members of Congress about legislation that is pending here. We met, and he continued on his journey. 
   He finished in California last Saturday, and is now having a well-deserved rest. George is an inspiration to those of us in Congress who are working hard to pass H.R. 3543. We have over 115 cosponsors. It is the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, and it is for the heroes and heroines of 9/11. It would treat and monitor all of those who were exposed to the deadly toxins, and it would treat those who are sick. It is the least we can do for these heroes and heroines. We should pass it before the seventh anniversary of 9/11.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6184, America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act, introduced by my good friend and colleague from Delaware, Congressman Castle. 
   I have had the great pleasure to work with Mr. Castle on several coin bills of this nature in the past, the very successful State quarters and most recently the Presidential dollars. I am proud to be the Democratic lead sponsor of this bill, and I am happy to report that it has strong bipartisan support, as shown by the fact that it passed out of the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous vote in support. 
   I want to thank Congressman Castle for all of his hard work on this legislation, as well as Chairman Frank for his support, and the support of the staff of the Financial Services Committee and our individual staffs for their hard work on this bill. Of course, all of us love our national parks, and especially those of our home State, which will be honored on each of these coins. 
   Beginning in 2010, new quarters will bear a design representing a national park or site in each State and the District of Columbia at the rate of 5 new designs a year. The sites will be selected at the beginning of the process by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the States, and the coins will be minted in the order in which the sites selected were established as national sites, which I think is a very clever touch. 
   As a former teacher and educator, I am always excited about the new designs on everyday coins because they encourage more Americans of all ages to pay attention to the coins in your pockets and learn a few facts about what is depicted. I can say of the very successful State quarter program, it became a very popular teaching tool. Many teachers devised lesson plans around the quarters, and many of my constituents collected these coins. My own daughter had a book with each of the quarters in it; and many people would ask me, when is the next quarter coming out? And because it was so successful, the 50 State quarter program raised $6.2 billion over the past 10 years of its life span which is just ending this year. And we can hope that we will have similar results from this series of coins. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. It is an education tool. It also will generate needed revenues for our Treasury. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my dear friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle who has attacked the Speaker of this House really unfairly and with false statements. 
   The point is and the reality is that we have two oil men in the White House and their policies are the ones that have benefited Big Oil and hurt the American consumer. Now under the leadership of the Democratic Speaker and the New Direction Congress, we have been passing solutions for the first time to help American consumers and to help this country move into the 21st century with policies that are important for conserving energy, renewable energy, efficient technologies, and reducing energy prices for the long run. 
   No, I will not yield. I have my time; you had yours. 
   First of all what, the New Direction Congress passed was the first new vehicle fuel-efficiency standards in 32 years. We also passed an historic commitment to affordable American-grown biofuels. If the other side of the aisle was interested in moving us into the 21st century and conserving energy, why in the world didn't they pass new vehicle fuel-efficiency standards? We passed it. This Congress passed it. The Democrats passed it, and are forcing the car builders and others to move in with fuel-efficient standards. 
   We also took action to lower gas prices by suspending oil purchasing for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These are very important initiatives. 
   Now the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, my very good friend, talked about the need to build new refineries. Well, ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP and Shell have publicly stated that they have no plans to build new refineries; instead, they prefer to expand existing facilities. These are their statements. Shell and BP all testified that they were unaware of any environmental regulations preventing them from building new refineries or expanding old ones. They can do that now. 
   Internal memos from oil companies make it very clear that oil companies decided that they needed to reduce refinery capacity to drive up their profits. And the New Direction Congress is  continuing to bring real relief to those feeling the pinch of the high gas and diesel prices, and ensuring the needs of families and businesses are put before the interests of Big Oil companies. 
   Now my dear friend on the other side of the aisle talks about drilling, drilling, drilling, drilling, as if we could drill ourselves out of the challenges we face. 
   The fact is that there are over 68 million acres on shore and offshore in the United States of America that are currently leased by oil companies and they are open to drilling and actually under a lease to do so but are not developed. Now we are talking about leases on 68 million acres of land that is owned by the American people. Now what Chairman Rahall says is use it or lose it, and I think he is absolutely correct. I support his bill, to say that you either drill on those 68 million acres or you give up your lease and let someone else drill there. That's what the Democrats are saying. We are not going to hand out more leases to the oil companies on public land that is owned by the public and is the land and the reserves of this country. We are saying to them if you have a lease, you use that lease. You drill. You're not going to get another one. And if you're not going to drill, then let's put it out for competitive bid and let someone else come forward and drill on that land. 
   The fact is that 80 percent of the oil available on the Outer Continental Shelf is in regions that are already open to leasing, but the oil companies haven't decided if it is worth their time to drill there. The fact is that drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield any oil for 10 years, and then would only save the customer, the consumer, 1.8 cents per gallon in 2025. The fact is that America uses a quarter of the world's oil consumption every day, but only 1.6 percent of the world's supply, so there is simply no way to drill ourselves to a solution. 
   I repeat, while my colleagues were running this body, where were their solutions? I didn't see any. I didn't see them raising the mile per gallon of gas, I didn't see them conserving. I didn't see them investing in biofuels or moving forward with innovative energy solutions, as this new Democratic leadership has been doing. They have just held onto the failed policies of the past which have gotten us to where we are. As I repeat, we have two oil men in the White House that have been behind these policies. 
   So I would say that the Democratic leadership has done a great deal to help the American consumer. They are facing many challenges. Their wages are stagnant. The price of gasoline is now over $4 a gallon. The price of milk is over $4 a gallon. So they are facing really inflation and many, many challenges. 
   The Democratic leadership has come forward with a stimulus package to help the American taxpayer, the American citizen. We have come forward with a fuel-efficiency standard. We have come forward with many hearings today on the possible manipulation of oil in the futures market so that we can curb those abuses if they are documented. We are for drilling on the 68 million acres that are currently under contract and should be drilled on. 
   So this Congress, I congratulate the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats and the relevant committees. We have passed legislation, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. We have passed the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act. We have passed the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act which will provide consumer relief by giving the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate energy prices. President Bush has threatened a veto of this very commonsense consumer protection measure. 
   So I say with all due respect to my wonderful colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle, where were your ideas when you could pass them? Where are your ideas now? The ones that we are passing that helps the consumer and moves this country into the 21st century, and that makes a profitable use of land that is owned by the American people instead of giving more, and in many cases in a no-bid process to oil companies who are just sitting on it and not doing anything to help the American consumer. 
   So I would say you brought it up, so I am just responding to some of your allegations. 
   I feel this is such an important issue that I would like to yield 2 minutes to my distinguished colleague from the great State of New York, Congressman Serrano, on H.R. 6184, and I thank him for his leadership on this important bill.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Just to respond to my dear friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle, I'm very appreciative that you're supportive of the bill before us, but I want to point out that there is nothing in this bill that would in any way prevent drilling. In fact, they can drill now on 68 million acres of land on which they have a lease. 
   And we did have a vote, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not support the vote that would compel the oil industry to start drilling or lose permits on this 68 million acres of undeveloped Federal oil reserves which they are currently warehousing and keeping domestic supply lower and prices higher. I believe that's a very balanced premarket approach. Use it or lose it. Let someone else drill there. 
   And industry is only using a fraction of its leases now. And refining is not an issue. Refineries are running below capacity.     
   But we have enacted in law, past laws, that are laws now, the Energy Independence and Security Act. This historic Act would increase vehicle fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon, and this is the first congressional increase in more than three decades. And this would be very helpful. 
   And I'd like to place into the Record an entire list of laws that have been enacted by this Democratic leadership, laws that are coming up to be considered, including cracking down on price gouging, and legislation that the House has passed and we're waiting for the Senate to act on: the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act, the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act. These are all important concrete steps, not rhetoric, but concrete steps to help consumers.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his hard work on so many important issues to the great city of New York and our country. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3033, the Contractor and Federal Spending Accountability Act, legislation I have authored to help bring integrity and accountability to the Federal procurement system. I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis, Chairman Towns and their staffs, and my own staff, for working so hard on this legislation. 
   The bill before us today has been modified from the version reported out by the committee to address concerns raised by some Members, including Ranking Member Davis. I want to thank him for his positive efforts on this bill, and for many positive efforts he has given to this committee in working in a collaborative way, and express my regret that he is retiring this year from this body. 
   Also, the concerns of the Chamber of Commerce have been addressed in the underlying bill. H.R. 3033, as amended, will fortify the current Federal suspension and debarment system by establishing a centralized and comprehensive database on actions taken against Federal contractors and assist participants requiring a description of each of these actions. 
   While the government has several separate information systems, currently there is no centralized comprehensive database for contracting officers to review prior performance and to review information on contractors before making an award or an additional contract award to contractors. 
   It requires the contracting officer to document why a prospective awardee is deemed responsible if that awardee has two or more offenses which would be cause for debarment within a 3-year period. H.R. 3033, as amended, specifies and clarifies that a ``concluded'' proceeding is one in which there is a finding of fault on the part of the person and the payment of restitution to a Federal or State government of $5,000 or more. 
   Additionally, it improves and clarifies the role of the Interagency Committee on Debarments and Suspension, and requires the administrator of General Services to report to Congress within 180 days with recommendations for further action to create the database. 
   This legislation has been strongly and consistently supported by the Campaign for Quality Construction and the Project on Government Oversight. 
   Currently the Federal Government's watchdogs, the Federal suspension and debarment officials, lack the information that they need to protect our business interests and taxpayers' dollars. 
   This system will give government procurement officers who are making these decisions more information about the qualifications and track records of the contractors. Beyond a listing of currently debarred or suspended persons, officials are now limited to their individual agency's knowledge of an entity's track record. This bill will make it easier for these procurement officers to prevent them giving contracts to those who repeatedly violate Federal laws or have poor performance, and it will prevent them from receiving future dollars from the Federal Government. 
   As a New York City councilwoman, I successfully led an effort to reform the contracting system of New York City. Included in that effort was a Vendex system which checked the backgrounds and the work of the contractors before awarding contracts. It has been credited with saving the city of New York hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   The United States is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, spending more than $419 billion on procurement awards in 2006, and over $440 billion on grants in 2005. It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used wisely and not wasted, certainly not wasted in our contracting system, and we should not be giving awards to contractors who have poor performance records. 
   I believe by improving the system for awarding contracts, I believe that this is critical for boosting the public's faith in our government and it will save taxpayers' dollars. I urge my colleagues to support this reform bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the underlying bill and the Baldwin amendment. ENDA will offer real protections to tens of millions of Americans now. Right now, far too many workers go to work every day fearing that they could be fired on the spot, no questions asked, if their employer discovered their sexual orientation. This year, it is legal in 30 States to fire someone simply because he or she is gay, lesbian or bisexual. 
   Hardworking, tax-paying Americans shouldn't be forced into the shadows, and they should not have to live with the constant, legitimate fear that they could lose their jobs. That is why I strongly support providing protection from discrimination to transgender Americans, and I will not rest until their right to live their lives free of fear, discrimination, and intolerance is the law of this land. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know from my years on the city council where we worked to pass similar legislation and my years in the women's movement that we need to make history now and pass the underlying bill and protect people here in America now.  
   No one should be discriminated against because of his or her sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. And this bill will also lay the groundwork to provide sorely needed protections in the future to countless more Americans who need and deserve them. 
   This historic advance for civil rights has been more than three decades in the making--and it has not come easy. 
   When Bella Abzug first introduced a sexual orientation civil rights bill in 1974, she was able to enlist only one cosponsor, Ed Koch, my predecessor in the district that I represent. It stood absolutely no chance of passage. 
   We've come a long way since then, but our progress has been hard-fought and incremental. 
   Most of our greatest legislative victories have only been achieved step by step. The measure before us today is by no means complete or definitive. 
   The sad truth is that transgender Americans need and deserve protection from employment discrimination. All too often they bear the brunt of brutal bigotry, and are subject to unspeakable hatred and violence. 
   That is why I strongly support providing protection from discrimination to transgender Americans. And I will not rest until their right to live their lives free of fear, discrimination and intolerance is the law of the land. 
   In 1986, when I served on the New York City Council, we succeeded in passing legislation to bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment and housing. That bill had come before the Council repeatedly since 1971. It took 15 years, but we finally managed to pass it. It was only later that the Council enacted specific protections for the transgender community. 
   Many said the 19th Amendment didn't go far enough when that passed. While it gave women the right to vote, it didn't address a host of social inequities between men and women, many of which persist today. Decades after that Amendment was ratified, we passed the Equal Pay Act and title VII. And, while we still haven't passed the Equal Rights Amendment, I remain optimistic that our day will soon come. 
   The New Direction Democratic Congress passed a hate crimes bill earlier this year that included important protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And we hope to have another important victory here today. I'm confident these incremental successes will lay the foundation for additional protections for the entire LGBT community in the future. 
   And so, while I deeply regret that transgender Americans are not protected by the legislation before us today, I nonetheless urge my distinguished colleagues to support it. I do so with the knowledge and the determination that we will be back to continue to press the fight for all Americans to live free from discrimination. 
   I urge my colleagues to help make history today by supporting this landmark legislation and taking this important step towards ensuring that discrimination based on sexual orientation will not be tolerated in the United States of America. 
   I would also like to thank Speaker PELOSI, Congressman FRANK, and Congresswoman BALDWIN for their leadership in this critical battle for civil rights.

   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to help make history today by taking this important step towards ensuring that discrimination based on sexual orientation will not be tolerated in the United States of America. 
   In the year 2007, it is legal in 30 states to fire someone simply because he or she is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 
   Hardworking, tax-paying Americans shouldn't have to live with the constant, legitimate fear they could lose their jobs. No one should be discriminated against because of his or her sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. 
   This bill will also lay the groundwork to provide sorely needed protections in the future to countless more Americans who need and deserve them.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered today by my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN.  
   Transgender Americans need and deserve protection from employment discrimination. All too often they bear the brunt of brutal bigotry, and are subject to unspeakable hatred and violence inspired by fear and ignorance. 
   That is why I strongly support this amendment to provide protection from job discrimination to transgender Americans. 
   Congress took an important step earlier this year when we passed a hate crimes bill that included protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. 
   It is unfortunate that there is not at this time the same degree of support in the House to pass this measure. 
   Discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression should simply not be tolerated in the United States of America. 
   And, while there may not be enough support for us to pass this amendment today, I pledge to work with my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin and other like-minded Members to educate and persuade this House of the need to enact protections from discrimination for transgender Americans. 
   We will not rest until the right of every American, regardless of his or her gender identity or gender expression, to live free of fear, discrimination and intolerance is the law of the land. 
   I urge my distinguished colleagues in this House to strike a blow for justice and tolerance by passing this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I congratulate the dean of our delegation for his leadership on this important agreement, and I rise in strong support.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   This agreement represents a new direction for trade agreements. 
   This agreement will provide greater market access for and remove tariffs on American goods with a country that already enjoys the export of a number of goods to the United States duty-free. 
   Working off the historic agreement negotiated by Democrats in May of this year, this agreement has been negotiated to include critical labor and environmental provisions and will help ensure the economic and national security of the region. 
   It was the lack of these environmental and labor standards that led me to vote against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). 
   Among the labor standards negotiated in this agreement are worker rights and protections for which we have fought these many years. 
   As a result of the May 10 agreement negotiated by House Democrats, the labor chapter of the Peru FTA includes a fully enforceable commitment that countries adopt and enforce the five basic international labor standards. 
   In addition, this agreement also includes commitments to enforce a sixth set of rights--those pertaining to acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health. 
   This agreement includes critical new environmental provisions. 
   It requires Peru to adopt, maintain, and enforce obligations under seven common multilateral environmental agreements; specify numerous concrete steps that Peru must take to curb illegal logging and impose a clear schedule for doing so; and it gives the United States  an unprecedented set of enforcement tools to ensure that Peru meets its environmental commitments. 
   These provisions are a far cry from the ``enforce your own laws'' of NAFTA and CAFTA. 
   Beyond the labor and environmental standards negotiated in this agreement, I believe this agreement is a vital instrument towards economic and political security. 
   Having a strong and stable ally in Latin America will allow aid to the United States in our continued battle against narcotic trafficking. 
   Again, I support this agreement and I urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on this important bill. 
   The economy has shed nearly 1 million private sector jobs this year and 9.5 million workers are unemployed, 2.2 million more than a year ago. As this chart shows, unemployment is particularly high in nearly half of the States. The red shows where unemployment is over 6 percent, the orange is where it is 5 percent. 
   In high unemployment States, over a third of the workers who have lost their jobs, through no fault of their own, are exhausting even their extended unemployment benefits. Nearly 800,000 workers will be left without additional Federal jobless benefits starting next week when their extension is set to run out. Over half of these workers live in high unemployment States. 
   Congress has extended benefits to the States hardest hit by unemployment in every other downturn in the past 25 years. This bill will bring relief to families struggling to find work and make ends meet and also boost our sagging economy. 
   In light of today's jobless numbers, I urge a strong yes vote on this important bill.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his extraordinary leadership, and I rise to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the financial rescue plan. The risk of not acting is just too great for Americans to bear. 
   Today's grim jobless number showed that the problems facing Main Street are mounting. If we do not pass a financial rescue package today, credit markets may fail and working families and businesses will suffer. Consumers are the lifeblood of our economy, and most families need access to credit to make major purchases like buying a home, a car, or paying for college tuition. 
   Without financing, families will cut back on spending, businesses will see sales plummet, our economy will weaken, and even more jobs will be lost. A credit freeze also means small businesses may have trouble making their payrolls. Credit card interest rates could soar, and businesses could be unable to borrow and create new jobs. 
   This is a first step. We are continuing with hearings on Monday and Tuesday of next week. I congratulate Mr. Bachus for his work with the chairman for putting in tough safeguards for taxpayers, oversight and homeowners.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. It is long overdue.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   This bill requires group health plans to cover mental health and substance-related disorders the same way they cover medical and surgical disorders. 
   It's time we permanently end discrimination on the basis of illness. 
   We all know that mental illness is just like any physical illness. But we would never think of limiting treatment for cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. 
   People would be outraged. 
   So, it's amazing to me that some people still see mental illness as different and separate from physical illness. 
   In New York City, since 9/11, we have all seen an increase in the number of people seeking mental health services. 
   No one should feel ashamed for seeking needed healthcare and no one should be denied care simply because they cannot afford it. 
   More than ever, our returning soldiers, our firefighters, and our police officers, are suffering from traumatic events and need the proper care. 
   Our soldiers are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental health problems. 
   Too often, the stigma associated with mental health prevents them from seeking the care they so desperately need. 
   In my own district, our police officers and others are still coping with the horrors they witnessed after the tragedy of 9/11. 
   Thanks to the New York City Police Foundation's program, Project COPE, civilian and uniform members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) are able to access mental health services. 
   Project COPE is an example of an outside group providing mental health services because too many people are going without proper treatment. 
   I am proud that today, as a bipartisan body, we will pass legislation that will help ease access to treatment and will help millions of people and their families battling mental illness.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise to express my deep sadness to learn of the passing of one of my good friends and colleagues, PAUL GILLMOR. 
   PAUL was the ranking member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee that I chair, and I had the great privilege of working with him on so many important issues throughout the years. In fact, this morning at the hearing we were holding on the subprime mortgage crisis, I had reserved 4 minutes for PAUL to speak and he didn't come to the meeting. He was always punctual, and so we sent a staff member out to find him and found out the very, very sad news. 
   PAUL was a distinguished Representative representing Ohio for many years. He held some partisan positions as the minority deputy whip; but on Financial Services, he was always ready to reach across the aisle and to work in a bipartisan way for the safety and soundness of our financial institutions and protections of consumer concerns. 
   He had a great deal of experience in banking, and in fact had run banks back in his home State of Ohio, so he brought the practical common sense of having known the business firsthand, and he always had valuable insights. 
   Just before we broke for our August work period, we had introduced a bill together on file freeze and negotiated various aspects that he thought was important for the bill. He was an outstanding person. 
   He served in Vietnam and he was a distinguished veteran. He served in the Air Force and achieved the status of captain. My brother served in Vietnam, and we shared conversations about that experience. 
   He was an extremely outstanding leader in his home State of Ohio, and actually served in the State senate and headed the State senate for five terms before becoming elected to Congress. 
   My heart goes out to his wife and children. I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that PAUL'S presence in this Chamber will be deeply, deeply missed. He was an outstanding patriot and outstanding Congressman and an outstanding spouse, husband and father. We are all deeply, deeply saddened.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2638, the FY 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. I want to commend Chairman PRICE and Ranking Member ROGERS for their leadership in getting the bill to the Floor today. 
   H.R. 2638 provides critical funding to protect the homeland in case of disasters, both man-made and natural. As a representative for New York City, terrorist target number one, I am especially pleased to see the increased funding in several important areas. The bill increases funding by $30 million over last year's amount to $800 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative grants. While I am pleased to see this increase in funding, I strongly believe that these grants should receive even more funding so that urban areas that are high-risk targets for terrorist attacks are better prepared. The bill also includes increased funding for port security grants and rail and transit grants, both of which are vitally important to New York City. 
   This bill addresses the critical needs in aviation security by including funding to double the amount of cargo inspected on passenger airplanes. After going through security checks to get on a plane, passengers should feel secure that the cargo stowed underneath their feet has been checked as well. This funding is an important step in making that happen. 
   I also want to note the language in the bill that aims to reduce the number of sole-source contracts given out by the Department of Homeland Security. The bill requires, except in emergencies and when certain distribution mechanisms already exist, a full and open competitive process for the obligation of all grant and contract funds. As a longtime proponent of fair and open contracting, this language is critical to ensuring greater accountability and transparency in spending taxpayers' dollars. 
   H.R. 2638 is a good, comprehensive bill that will improve our security and our preparedness should another disaster strike. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3920, the Trade Globalization Assistance Trade Act of 2007. 
   This legislation would overhaul the current Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, program to better meet the needs of American workers and communities affected by globalization. 
   This legislation passed the Ways and Means Committee by the strong bipartisan vote of 26-14 and I hope that we are able to provide a similar bipartisan vote again here today. 
   After years of trade policies that all too often diminished the importance of our workforce, today's legislation will rightfully support the working men and women in our country. 
   Specifically, H.R. 3920 would expand Trade Adjustment Assistance coverage to more workers, including service workers, and substantially improve the program's training opportunities and associated health care benefits. 
   The bill also creates new benefits and tax incentives for industries and communities that have been hit hard by trade. 
   Finally, the legislation would promote long-needed reforms to the unemployment insurance system, recognizing that all unemployed workers, not just those who lose their jobs because of trade, deserve our support in getting back on their feet. 
   I congratulate Chairman Rangel for bringing forth this important legislation and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Sex trafficking has been called the slavery issue of the 21st century. And because girls and women are its victims, it is one of the great women's issues of our time. 
   The lives of trafficking victims are pure horror. These photographs that are in the current issue of Prism magazine include mug shots or photographs of trafficked women arrested for prostitution over periods ranging from 1 to no more than 3 years. 
   Better than words could ever convey, the photos display the destruction that takes place for hundreds of thousands of trafficked girls and women. Notice how when they were first arrested, they all look distinctly different. But in the end, they all look the same. You cannot tell the difference from one to the other. That is because they have been abused, psychologically battered, broken and devastated at the hands of their pimps.  
   We need effective prosecution strategies against their traffickers. 
   We need to protect the victims of the sex trade industry and punish the predators who exploit them.

Two of the Dutch Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, both came from New York. 
   If you go to the City Museum of New York, there is really a beautiful exhibit that pays tribute to the many contributions in our early days by the Dutch. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution and to the preceding resolution, which honors the 95th anniversary of the Girl Scouts. I really rise today to honor the 95 years of educating, nurturing, and empowering our Nation's girls through the Girl Scout programs. Its 3.6 million members learn skills and develop character that help them succeed in the real world. 
   The Girl Scouts' Web site highlights the organization's focus on the leadership, strong values, social conscience and conviction about their own potential and self-worth of its members. These are vital attributes that help girls grow into the women who will lead our country and inspire the next generation of scouts. 
   I know personally about the power of being a Girl Scout, because I was one. The basic character and skills I learned then have served me my entire life, and they even serve me now in Congress. 
   For that I owe the Girl Scouts and the great Juliette Gordon, who founded the organization in 1912, a great debt of gratitude. I am proud that my hometown, New York City, is home to the Girl Scouts' national headquarters. I applaud the scouts for 95 years of empowerment and excellence, and I wish them many more years of helping nurture America's girls.

A wholesale failure of the banking system would be the financial equivalent of an economic heart attack, the consequences of which could severely affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of ordinary American citizens. 
   The bill before us endeavors to prevent such a calamity. I do not pretend that it is a perfect bill, and taxpayers are rightfully outraged at the prospect of bailing out irresponsible banks and those that lead them. 
   Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank have made improvements in this bill. We have imposed stronger oversight, allowed judicial review, and mandated transparency through the publication of asset purchase prices. We have directed the Treasury to safeguard taxpayer interest while reducing foreclosure, allowed the government to obtain equity warrants so taxpayers may participate in the upside of rescued banks. We have created a system under which the banks themselves will pay to insure each other's assets. 
   Perhaps most importantly, half the funds, $350 billion, will not be made available until after a 4-month cooling off period, during which time we in Congress can use that transparent reporting to examine the prices paid for the assets, the warrants obtained, and the program's effectiveness in stabilizing the financial system and aiding American taxpayers and homeowners.     
   We will continue our work on October 6 in hearings before the Government Reform and Oversight Committee in ways to reform the financial system and stabilize our economy.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  928, the ``Inspector General Reform Act'' This legislation includes provisions of a bill that I introduced last year, along with Ranking Member Tom Davis, which will provide for the enhanced protection of the Internal Revenue Service and its employees. 
   In 1998, Congress passed the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, which created the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). The legislation gave TIGTA the responsibility for protecting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) against external attempts to corrupt or threaten IRS employees. At the same time, it excluded the provision of providing ``physical security'' from TIGTA's responsibilities 
   Prior to the enactment of this law, the former IRS Inspection Service had been responsible for protecting the IRS against external attempts to corrupt or threaten IRS employees. The IRS Inspection Service was responsible for providing armed escorts for IRS employees who were specifically threatened or who were contacting individuals designated as ``Potentially Dangerous Taxpayers.'' The law transferred most of those duties to the new Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Inexplicably, ``physical security'' was excluded from TIGTA's statutory responsibilities. 
   In its current statutory mission, TIGTA investigates all allegations of threats or assaults involving IRS employees and assists U.S. Attorneys' offices with appropriate prosecutions. However, if TIGTA determines that any of the threats or assaults it investigates call for the provision of physical security, the language of the 1998 law precludes TIGTA from taking action. 
   Authorizing TIGTA to have armed escort authority would be both more efficient and more effective in advancing tax administration and ensuring the safety of IRS employees. 
   I am pleased that upon passage of H.R. 928 today, this bill will be sent to the president for his signature. I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for their support of this provision, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 928.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her extraordinary leadership, really creative leadership, along with BARNEY FRANK and others. 
   I rise in support of the bill, which will revitalize the FHA and will ultimately assist low- and modern-income families seeking the American Dream of homeownership and providing much-needed stability and liquidity in the markets with the subprime crisis. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for accepting an amendment that I authored that would expand affordable and available daycare by giving an incentive to build or include licensed child care facilities in FHA-insured properties. 
   This bill does many things that are very important. It builds on the President's recent announcement that FHA will work with homeowners who are having a difficult time paying their mortgage due to a reset in this interest rate. This will help with the subprime crisis by, number one, increasing the loan limits in high-cost areas of the country like New York City where FHA has been driven from the market, forcing many borrowers to turn to high-cost financing. It will, secondly, authorize zero down and lower down payment FHA loans for home buyers who could not otherwise make these payments. It directs FHA to underwrite to borrowers with higher credit risks than FHA currently serves. And it permanently eliminates the current statutory volume cap on FHA reverse mortgage loans to permit this program to meet the growing needs of home equity-rich, cash-poor senior citizens and, very importantly, reinvesting the increased profits created into an affordable housing fund. 
   With all the great things in this bill, I am concerned that we may be loosening the reins a bit too much by allowing mortgage brokers to bypass the current audit and net worth requirements and instead posting a surety bond to participate in FHA. I have been very concerned with the role the largely unregulated mortgage broker industry has played in the current subprime mortgage crisis. 
   I do support this bill, and I hope we can work to ensure the safety and soundness of FHA and we are expanding affordable and available housing. And congratulations to Chairman Waters.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill. And in particular, I want to sincerely and deeply thank Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh on behalf of all New Yorkers and this Nation for providing the leadership to include for the first time much-needed money for the health care needs of the heroes and heroines of 9/11. 
   These rescue, recovery and cleanup workers selflessly rushed into the flames of 9/11 to save the lives of others. We lost 3,000 people on 9/11, but many thousands more lost their health. This bill includes $50 million for their treatment. This is the first time it has been part of an appropriations bill, and I deeply thank Chairman Obey for working so hard to make this happen. In the past it has been tacked onto emergency spending and to the Iraq spending bill, but it is the least we can do to provide health care to these men and women. 
   Very importantly, the bill includes detailed language requiring the administration to develop and submit a long-term comprehensive plan to address these critical health needs. This is a tremendous step forward. I thank Chairman Obey.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment which would cut funding to the American Ballet Theater, which is headquartered in the district I represent. 
   Last year, the House of Representatives and the Senate showed their support for the American Ballet Theater by passing identical resolutions recognizing the American Ballet Theater's important role as cultural ambassador and America's national ballet company. 
   An important part of ABT's mission is to expose as many people as possible to high quality ballet. This is at the heart of the request for studio company funding to bring ABT studio company and a host of educational and cultural programs to smaller communities that have limited economic means and access to these cultural benefits. 
   Educational research strongly suggests that young people who learn about and participate in the arts acquire skills that help them in decisionmaking, problem solving, creative thinking, and teamwork.     
   An increasing number of studies also finds that art programs motivate young people to learn, assisting in improving performance in core academic subjects. 
   For some children, the arts provide the impetus to stay in school until graduation, and for others, inspire them to pursue a college education. 
   Arts education programs will continue to play an important role as the Nation struggles to improve high school graduation rates, develop pre-kindergarten programs, and counter the achievement gap in urban communities. 
   The requested funds will allow ABT to expand the studio program's outreach by completing in-depth residencies in small and medium-sized communities in five regions, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and West. Bringing world-class ballet and education programs, they're a very important part of the ABT's key mission. 
   More than simply offering performances, a studio company engagement leverages the company's resources to offer a range of educational activities and direct interaction with the company, often partnering with local ballet schools and universities to reach the local dance constituency. 
   While visiting a community, the studio company works with dance departments within universities and supplies tickets and study guides to local K-12 schools, exposing young people to dance, encouraging movement, physical fitness, creativity, and concentration. 
   Performing for local schools challenges youth to become more serious about the dance craft, while inspiring and expanding awareness of the possibilities for a career in the performing arts. The local arts community benefits from the experience of hosting ABT. 
   It appears that my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona, does not support the arts and does not appreciate the importance of arts education to our young people. 
   As I said, the arts are critical to our children's overall education. Creativity can be taught. This funding allows those communities who do not have the access to the arts to gain the benefits of having world-class arts education brought to them.  
   This is a worthy project, and I hope my colleagues recognize its importance. I urge the defeat of my friend and colleague's amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. The gentleman may not support the opportunity to bring the arts to small communities across the country that may inspire them. 
   I was very much inspired as a young person, going to the ballet. In fact, I studied for many years to be a professional dancer until I crushed my leg in an automobile accident. 
   But what the gentleman does support, he talks about what he doesn't support. But what the gentleman did support was a budget that Clinton left President Bush, a surplus well over $5 trillion that has been squandered. And what this gentleman has supported is budgets that have given this country records, but they're the wrong kinds of records. 
   We now have a record debt over $8 trillion. Every man, woman and child in America owes over $29,000 personally to that debt. And this administration gave this country record deficits, the largest in the history of this country, and the largest trade deficit in the history of this country.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1149, which expresses support for the designation of April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month. 
   Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that produces tiny lumps of cells called granulomas in the lungs, lymph nodes or skin. The cause of sarcoidosis is unclear, but it has been associated with exposures to organic and chemical dusts, metals, silica and wood dust or smoke. 
   We know that New York City Fire Fighters who responded to the World Trade Center collapses in the aftermath of 9/11 have markedly higher rates of sarcoidosis. In the year immediately following 9/11, there was a 6-fold increase from pre-9/11 levels. 
   There's no doubt that many heroes of 9/11 are sick because of their exposure to Ground Zero toxins. Raising awareness of sarcoidosis and encouraging funding for research into the disease is one small way we can honor the heroes and heroines of 9/11. 
   I thank the gentleman from Illinois for introducing this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 330, which supports the goals and ideals of National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. 
   I was the lead Democratic sponsor of the original legislation, introduced by former Representative Mark Green and signed into law in 2003, that designated April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. 
   It is important that we remember that preventing sexual assault should be a top priority during each month of the year. Every 2 1/2 minutes, someone in the United States is sexually assaulted. I have long been a champion of increased efforts to prevent violence against women and in 2004, legislation that I first introduced, ``The Debbie Smith Act,'' was signed into law. Through this landmark act, we have the ability to protect our daughters, our sisters, and our friends by putting rapists behind bars through DNA evidence. We know that DNA evidence is better than a fresh set of fingerprints. And we know that it is often better than eyewitness testimony. With ``The Debbie Smith Act,'' the hundreds of thousands of rape kits that were gathering dust across the country are finally being processed. 
   In January I introduced H.R. 5057, ``The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act,'' to extend the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Elimination Program through FY 2014. I am pleased to have been joined in introducing the legislation by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman CONYERS and Ranking Member SMITH. 
   It is vitally important that we support the Violence Against Women Act by fully funding the important programs that will help women escape abusive and dangerous situations and begin new lives that are free from violence and fear. The organizations, shelters, and counseling centers that are on the front lines of this problem need our steadfast commitment that they will have the resources to continue their important work. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (NAME DISPUTE BETWEEN GREECE AND FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the name dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). We call it FYROM for short. FYROM is located just north of present day Greece, and its capital is Skopje. It is one of the countries formed from the breakup of the former Yugoslav Republic, Yugoslavia. 
   FYROM is an interim name. The U.N. oversees a framework where Greece and FYROM have agreed to negotiate a mutually agreeable permanent name for this new nation. As the founder and cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, this is an issue of tremendous importance to Greece and the Caucus. 
   All historical and archaeological evidence demonstrates that the ancient Macedonians were Greek. Macedonia is a Greek name that was designated in the northern area of Greece for 2,500 years. 
   In 1944, the name of Skopje region was changed to Macedonia as part of Tito's imperialistic campaign to gain control of the Greek province of Macedonia. The United States opposed Tito's use of the name Macedonia at that time, but in November 2004, unilaterally and without warning, this present administration decided to recognize the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia as Macedonia, using the Greek name. It was a shock and a disappointment to the Greek American community, and myself and many others, that the White House went against prior U.S. policy to recognize FYROM as Macedonia just 2 days after the 2004 presidential election, and before talks were completed among the nations most directly affected by the outcome. 
   Along with former Representative Bilirakis and 68 of our colleagues, we sent a letter to the former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, expressing our concerns about this decision. We also organized meetings with the American Ambassador and other officials in the State Department. We believe that the name ``Macedonia'' properly belongs to Greek culture and, therefore, should not be used by any other country. Greek Macedonia is one of the oldest civilizations known to man, and the history of this name should be recognized and respected. 
   Along with my colleagues, Bilirakis, Sarbanes and Space, we have introduced legislation, H.R. 356, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the FYROM should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the U.N.-brokered interim agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding hostile activities or propaganda, and should work with the U.N. and Greece to achieve long-standing U.S. and U.N. policy goals of finding a mutually acceptable name. Our bipartisan resolution now has over 114 cosponsors. 
   I just want to say that, in a major good will gesture, Greece has already agreed with the word Macedonia in the name. And they say it would be acceptable as long as it is combined with some type of qualifier to make clear that there are no designs on the historical boundaries of the provinces of Macedonia. But Skopje keeps doing sort of antagonistic things. This week, they erected a billboard in Skopje that depicts the Greek flag, but in the area where the cross is, they have put in a swastika. I would like to say to my colleagues, if someone erected billboards with the American flag and put a swastika where our stars are, we would be somewhat upset. 
   Also, in their textbooks, and I have examples here, they print maps that show that Skopje includes territories of Greece. They have also printed on their currency the symbol of Greece; the white tower was on their currency. We have since had them remove it. But I would say to my colleagues, if at the height of the power of the USSR, if they started printing maps that showed their boundaries, including Alaska, and decided to take our Statue of Liberty and put it on their flag, I think we would be a little upset that our symbols and our territory had been used in such a way.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act. 
   I want to commend Chairman Miller on this legislation, which provides the single largest investment in higher education since the GI bill--at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   I am proud that this Democratic Congress has tackled the college cost crisis: the time to act is now. Over the last 5 years, college costs have grown by nearly 40 percent. Students across the country are graduating with more and more debt. In my home state of New York, the typical student with need-based loans graduates from 4-year public schools with over $14,000 in debt. And each year nearly 200,000 students in our country hold off on attending college, or opt out altogether, simply because they cannot afford to go. 
   This historic bill would make college more affordable by cutting interest rates on subsidized student loans in half over the next 5 years. In New York, this means an average student saves $4,570 over the life of their loan. 
   It will also increase the purchasing power of the Pell Grant Scholarship, upping the maximum scholarship by at least $500 over the next 4 years and ultimately reaching a maximum scholarship of at least $5,200 by 2011. In New York, this increased purchasing power could directly help over 420,000 students. 
   Under the College Cost Reduction Act, students from New York and all across the country will be better able to achieve their goals and reach their dreams. Our Nation and our economy also benefit when we strengthen the middle class by making college more affordable. I am proud to cast my vote for this historic bill, which makes a tremendous step towards ensuring that no one is denied the opportunity to go to college simply because of the price.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Representative WAXMAN, that would make important reforms to the contracting process. 
   Particularly, I want to note my support for provisions in the amendment based on my legislation which passed the House last month, H.R. 3033, the ``Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act.'' That bill and this amendment would fortify the current federal procurement system by establishing a centralized and comprehensive database on actions taken against federal contractors and assistance participants. It requires the contracting officer to document why a prospective awardee is deemed responsible if that awardee has two or more offenses which would be cause for debarment within a 3-year period. Additionally, it improves and clarifies the role of the Interagency Committee on Debarments and Suspension, and requires the Administrator of General Services to report to Congress within 180 days with recommendations for further action to create the database. 
   Currently, federal agency officials lack the information that they need to protect our business interests and taxpayers' dollars. This amendment will make it easier for these individuals to prevent those who repeatedly violate federal law from receiving millions of dollars from the federal government. 
   As a New York City Councilwoman, I successfully led an effort to implement a similar system. This system has aided the City of New York tremendously, and it has helped to prevent habitual bad actors and felons from being awarded city contracts. 
   The United States is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world spending more than $419 billion on procurement awards in FY2006 and $440 billion on grants in FY2005. It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers' dollars are used wisely and not wasted by some contractors who are more interested in lining their pockets with profits than providing the American people with the goods and services they are paying for. 
   I also want to acknowledge Representative MARK UDALL for his supportive efforts to improve the federal contracting system, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   House Democrats plan to send the President a smaller war funding bill than the one he requested but one with a bigger message: Start bringing our troops home now. 
   Without a change in course, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Federal spending on the war could reach $2.4 trillion by 2017. A new report from the Joint Economic Committee finds that when you add in the ``hidden costs'' of the war, such as higher oil prices, interest payments, and helping to take care of our wounded veterans, the total economic costs will rise by over $1 trillion to $3.5 trillion.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, later today, this House will consider H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. It is landmark reform that will level the playing field between credit card companies and consumers. 
   For too long, card issuers have been able to do anything they want any time they want, and cardholders can take it or leave it. But credit cards have become an essential part of most households, and when rates are hiked retroactively, double-cycle billing charges interest on balances already paid, and when multiple over-limit fees are charged for just one over-limit transaction, something has gone haywire and consumers on Main Street often face the same kind of credit crunch that Wall Street is now coping with. Even the Federal Reserve calls these credit card practices ``unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive.'' 
   Every game needs an umpire, and today the House can help ``backstop''  American consumers with these reforms by passing the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. I urge support for this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule on H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. The rule before us gives the House an opportunity to have a clear up-or-down vote on meaningful credit card reforms that will level the playing field between cardholders and credit card companies. 
   This legislation passed the House Financial Services Committee on July 31 on a vote of 39-27 and has the support of 155 cosponsors in this House. 
   For too long our constituents have found themselves on the wrong side of a very uneven playing field between them and their credit card companies. This bill restores fairness to credit cards and brings back the notion that a deal is a deal. 
   The bill that this rule will allow for consideration represents a work product that the committee and I started at the beginning of this Congress. We met with the stakeholders, issuers, consumer groups and the regulators and economists. We listened to real consumers and experts in consumer law and economics. We held six hearings in my subcommittee on the reforms contained in this bill and the reforms that are proposed by the Federal Reserve. 
   A year ago I held a round table which produced gold standard principles to guide voluntary issuer action. Several issuers announced changes in policy consistent with the principles, and I applaud their efforts. 
   In May, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administrator released proposed rules to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices that track the key provisions of my legislation. These regulations have received an astonishing, record-breaking 56,000 comments from consumers in support, the largest ever in history. 
   But without legislation, regulations can be stopped or scaled back, and lucrative abuse of practices will continue, and issuers who gave them up will lose profits and their market share. We need legislation to level the playing field for consumers and issuers so that the normal forces of the free market can work together again. 
   The bill has been endorsed by 12 consumer groups. I would like to place their names in the Record and applaud their hard work. Labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, and especially the SEIU, and civil rights organizations, the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, the NAACP, and the National Council of La Raza. Editorials and op-eds endorsing the need for credit card reform have run in more than 55 newspapers across the Nation, and these editorials can be seen on my Website. Commentators from Pat Robertson of Christian broadcasters and Lou Dobbs of CNN have consistently supported this effort. Senator Barack Obama has called for a Credit Cardholder's Bill of Rights, and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin has said that Republicans should get on this issue and not leave it to Democrats. So it is a bipartisan effort. 
   Even four of the five banking regulators have called for the specific reforms contained in this bill. I say this because some on the other side may argue against this rule. But I want the American people to understand all of the work that has gone into this work product. This bill, this process has been open and bipartisan. 
   Today, with the rule now before us, we get to preserve the core principles of this legislation, and this rule gives us a chance to have a clean up-or-down vote on meaningful credit card reform. I support this rule and look forward to the underlying debate. 
   I would like to conclude by saying that it is now clear that in the area of consumer credit, the same lack of reasonable regulations, transparency and prudent lending has led to a level of pain on Main Street that matches or exceeds the pain on Wall Street. This is our chance to do something about it. 
   We are called upon to come forward with a $700 billion backstop for Wall Street. This legislation gives a backstop and support to Main Street. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. I introduced this bill, together with Chairman Frank. This important legislation has 155 cosponsors. A dozen national consumer groups have not only endorsed this legislation, but have made it one of their top priorities. The AFL-CIO and especially the SEIU have strongly supported the bill. Major civil rights groups saw this bill as necessary to stop abuses to their constituents. 
   Over 50 newspapers from all over the Nation published editorials and op-eds in support of credit card reform, from California to Florida and even my own hometown paper, The New York Times. 
   The Federal Reserve, whose first priority is protecting the safety and soundness of our financial institutions and our economy, has called the credit card practices addressed in this bill ``anticompetitive for markets and unfair and deceptive to consumers.'' Some 56,000 Americans wrote in in support of the proposed Federal rule, more than any in the history of the Fed, commenting in support of this bill. 
   Rarely do we get an opportunity to vote for legislation with such deep and widespread support. In the midst of the financial turmoil in our markets, Congress has been asked to provide $700 billion for Wall Street. Now we have a chance with this bill to do something for Main Street. 
   Credit cards are an essential part of our economy, but for too long card issuers have been allowed to do whatever they want, any time, for any reason. A deal is a deal, but what sort of a deal is it when one side gets to make all the decisions? This bill will get credit card practices back to basic principles of contractual fairness.     
   No other industry is allowed to raise the price of a product after the consumer has bought it. 
   Also, the credit card bill of rights bans ``any time any reason'' rate increases on existing card balances. It bans double cycle billing which charges interest on debt already paid. 
   It gives consumers 45 days notice of any rate increases so cardholders can decide whether to pay off their balances and shop for another card. The bill makes sure that consumers who borrow high rate balances such as emergency cash advances can pay them off by requiring issuers to credit some part of the payments to the high rate balances. 
   The bill stops due date gimmicks that trick cardholders into paying late and racking up unjustified fees. It prevents subprime cards from trapping the most vulnerable cardholders in a cycle of debt, and it prohibits issuing cards to vulnerable minors. 
   The bill will demonstrate, once and for all, that Congress is protecting working Americans, as well as large institutions, from the current financial storm. Unfair credit card debt is as toxic to ordinary citizens as subprime debt obligations are to investment banks. 
   This is an issue that cuts across social and economic groups. Everyone has a credit card, and too many have a credit card story of getting hit with an unfair or deceptive practice. 
   I expect opponents of reform will argue that we should wait for the Federal Reserve to act or, as they put it, Congress should defer to the Fed; but this Congress and this majority cannot abdicate our responsibilities. This country cannot afford to wait for this administration and its regulators any longer. We need to take action now on this critical issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Enough is enough. It is time to help consumers. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We drafted and put in our bill in February. In May, the Federal Reserve came back with recommendations that mirrored our bill almost completely. 
   I would like to point out to him that the Federal Reserve is not in the Constitution, and we didn't leave it up to the regulators in the foreclosure crisis. We passed a bill to help homeowners stay in their homes. As we have seen Wall Street under attack, we are not leaving things up to the regulators. We passed legislation giving new direction to the Treasury to help the GSEs, investment banks, and insurers. So you are very selective on your comments that we should step back and let the Fed do everything. 
   I now recognize an outstanding member of our committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) who is co-chair of the Literacy Caucus on the Financial Services Committee.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his comments. I have been a supporter of transparency and fairness for consumers in the financial services area since I came to Congress. I believe consumers should have complete information so they can decide how to manage their money more efficiently and better. 
   I commend the gentleman from North Carolina for his efforts to provide consumers with robust information, and I would be happy to work with him on including these provisions.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, in response to my good friend's comments, the bill is very close to the rule, and opponents of the bill also oppose the rule. Industry opposes my bill and has filed arguments opposing the rule. The OCC opposes the bill and also opposes the Fed rule. The Federal Reserve and two other regulators support the substance of the bill. The administration opposes provisions of my bill that are identical to the Fed rule. 
   So it would be one thing if you supported the regulations you so passionately argue we should be waiting for; it is another thing to argue that we should wait for something that those who oppose protecting consumers, giving them information and providing fairness in the contractual agreement between credit card issuers and consumers. 
   I now yield 2 minutes to my good friend from the great State of Colorado, Mark Udall, who has been a leader in this debate and has had constituents who have come before the committee to testify. We thank him for his leadership.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. In response to my good friend and colleague, there is no evidence to support that claim. The argument that this will raise the cost of credit and restrict access to credit is an assertion that has absolutely no basis in fact. We asked the industry, at our six hearings, for some evidence to support this claim, and they had none. 
   The Federal Reserve and the General Accounting Office have said in reports that there is no evidence to support the argument that these abuses have lowered rates or increased access to credit. And these reports are on my Web site and also on the industry's Web site. 
   Getting rid of anticompetitive practices will increase access to credit. The Federal Reserve has called these practices anticompetitive. Getting rid of them will not hurt the market. Getting rid of these practices will help competition and increase, not decrease, access to credit. 
   As I mentioned earlier, we had a roundtable where many of the issuers participated, and some of them voluntarily started following the proposals, voluntarily. And they tried to move to the higher goal standards, and they were turning their backs on these unfair and deceptive practices. But they found that they were losing profit and market share. So we need to level the playing field not only for consumers, but for the industry itself. 
   I would now like to yield 2 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Christopher Shays, who is a member of the Financial Services Committee.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. In response to my good friend on the other side of the aisle, this has not been a rush to judgment. Democrats have been working on this bill for well over 2 years. My subcommittee has held 6 hearings, numerous meetings, roundtable discussions with consumers and issuers. The gentlelady claims that Reg Z is the bill. Reg Z is not at all the same as this bill. Reg Z from the Federal Reserve deals just with disclosure, and the Federal Reserve has said disclosure is not enough. They have called the practices unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive, and have come forward with recommendations that, in many ways, resemble the bill that is before us today.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to my good friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Castle, for whom I have great respect, and we have worked together productively in many ways. If you support these reforms, as you have so stated, then you should vote for them, and you should not vote for delay and weakening by waiting for some action that may happen in the future. If you support these reforms that have been called unfair and deceptive, then I hope you will join us in a bipartisan effort to correct the system. 
   Now many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that we should not act. But how in the world can we not act now? We are providing a $700 billion rescue for banks. How can we not provide basic fairness to consumers and some help and rescue to Main Street? 
   These practices have been called by the Fed unfair and deceptive and anticompetitive. We are helping consumers and the market by getting rid of them. The current situation makes it more urgent that we do so, not less. 
   Many, many people worked long and hard on this bill, and I would like to first and foremost thank the chairman of this committee, Barney Frank, for his consistent support and input; the 155 cosponsors of this legislation; other members of the Financial Services Committee that took a leadership role, Keith Ellison, Emanuel Cleaver, Lincoln Davis; also Mark Udall, Peter Welch, and Louise Slaughter for their leadership on the issue; Walter Jones and Chris Shays who were supportive from the beginning; the many consumer groups without whom we could not have gotten the broad base of support for this legislation; the labor unions, the AFL-CIO, especially the SCIU, which made this a top priority, civil rights groups; and certainly, the staff: my own staff, Eleni Constantine and Edward Mills, who have poured their heart and intelligence into this effort for 2 years; and the staff of the full committee, Michael Beresik, Patience Singleton, Charles Yi and Rick Maurano. Thank you for your efforts. 
   I urge very, very strong support for this long overdue reform.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Then regretfully I oppose your motion to recommit because it would effectively kill the bill because we are in the last week of session, and it is yet another delay tactic. If this was a serious concern, you would have raised this in the committee, and it is obviously just another effort to kill the bill. 
   We are being called upon to help Wall Street. We should also help Main Street, and I would urge my colleagues to understand that this bill has been supported not only by 155 of their colleagues but over 52 major publications across this country in editorials or op-eds, every single consumer organization in this country, and three of the regulators, including the Federal Reserve. 
   Rarely are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle given an opportunity to vote against stopping unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices that have been endorsed and called upon by many in this country to stop. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this motion to recommit. It is an effort to kill the bill. It is an effort not to help consumers, and it is an effort that would roll us backwards. They say they're for it. Well, we're giving them an opportunity to vote for consumers with this bill. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit. It kills the bill.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my colleague from New York for his tremendous leadership and my friend from the other side of the aisle for her support for this critical bill and so many others that are important to our country. I would like to thank Chairman Berman and Representative Brad Miller for their leadership along with 39 of our colleagues who have cosponsored this important Resolution 1227. I thank my colleagues for highlighting the sexual violence crisis that is plaguing the women and girls of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the DRC. 
   The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the world's richest countries in natural resources, but it has been recognized as the worst place on Earth to be a girl or a woman. Women and girls from the age of 8 to 80 are being violently raped systematically on a scale unimaginable in the hundreds of thousands. As a strategy of war, they are often raped with guns and knives which destroy their sexual organs and forces them into a life of suffering from fistula and other deformities. 
   As my friend from the great State of Florida mentioned, there are hospitals that are dedicated only to trying to restore their destroyed bodies from not only rape but the use of a knife or a gun. Countless women are being sold in sexual slavery for months on end. According to UNICEF, the DRC is currently witnessing the world's deadliest humanitarian crisis since World War II. 
   In this war, the battlefield is literally the bodies of women and girls. Congress must continue its commitment to the people of the DRC as it has demonstrated in the past. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support. The women in DRC and the girls deserve justice.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support for voting rights for residents of the District of Columbia. 
   I would note, Madam Speaker, that this month is Women's History Month, and it took women many, many long years to gain the right to vote. It took a constitutional amendment in 1920 to give women the right to vote. But today we can vote to give the vote to the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   I would note that it was not until 1965 that the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law to outlaw discriminatory practices like literacy tests and to ensure that all Americans, regardless of race, had access to the ballot. Today we have the opportunity to take another historic step in the right direction by ending the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of tax-paying Americans. 
   The people of the District of Columbia contribute to our national economy, they fight in our wars, and it is simply wrong that they not have representation. 
   I rise in strong support of voting rights for these residents.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1433, the ``District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act,'' introduced by my good friend and colleague, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. 
   She has been a steadfast champion for her constituents on many issues, and has worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to the floor today. 
   I want to commend her for her commitment to the residents of the District of Columbia, who for too long have been denied a voice in the House of Representatives. 
   We have seen through our own history the great struggles that have been endured to win the right to vote. 
   For women, it took a constitutional amendment in 1920 to give us the right the vote. 
   It was not until 1965 that the landmark ``Voting Rights Act'' was signed into law to outlaw discriminatory practices like literacy tests and to ensure that all Americans, regardless of race, had access to the ballot box. 
   Today, we are taking another step in the right direction by ending the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of tax-paying Americans. 
   It is undemocratic that we can determine the taxes that District residents pay to the Federal Government, but they have not been able to elect a representative who has a say in what those taxes will be. 
   The people of the District of Columbia contribute to our national economy and they fight in wars. 
   It is simply wrong that their representative in the House does not have full voting rights. 
   The House of Representatives is known as ``the people's house'' yet for the people living in the District of Columbia, their voices have been silenced for far too long. 
   It is sadly ironic that the citizens living in the Nation's Capital do not have full representation in the House.  
   With this legislation, we will change history. 
   I urge my colleagues to support his legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the most recent employment report showing modest job gains in February provided further signs of a slowing economy. Private sector employment rose by just 58,000 jobs, the smallest monthly gain in nearly 2 1/2 years. 
   The unemployment rate edged down last month only because the labor force shrank, and many people are discouraged by their job prospects. This is hardly the picture of a robust labor market, which is not good news for workers. 
   President Bush is now tied with his father for the dubious honor of having the worst job-creation record of any President since President Hoover. American families are understandably worried about the future because the economy is weakening even before many have shared in the gains from the economic growth so far.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, as Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I am pleased to speak in the time reserved by the Budget Act for a discussion of economic goals. 
   America has the strongest and wealthiest economy in the world. When government makes the right choices, economic growth helps all Americans live a better life today and provides a good future for our children tomorrow. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has not been making responsible choices over the past 7 years. We must chart a more sensible course for economic policy than has been pursued by this administration. Our Democratic majority has made important progress, but there is still much more to do. 
   President Bush was once fond of saying that his policies were working to make the economy strong. But the economy is now teetering on the brink of what may be the second recession of the Bush Presidency. 
   It is now clear that even the relatively weak economic growth experienced earlier in this administration was built on an unstable foundation. 
   The soaring housing prices that helped fuel our economic recovery now appear to have been a classic asset bubble. The collapse of that bubble is spreading throughout our entire financial and credit system. 
   American families are optimistic, by nature, but they are understandably worried about the future. Most American families have struggled just to hold their economic ground. 
   Under President Bush's management, our economy has set record after record, but they have been the wrong kinds of records, historically, poor levels of job growth, the greatest gap between the haves and the have not since the 1920s, record numbers of uninsured Americans. Over 47 million Americans lack health insurance.     
   A record $9 trillion Federal debt, the largest in our history, and the largest single-year deficit in U.S. history. Record oil prices, record declines in the value of the dollar, record trade deficits that are the largest in history, record declines in housing prices and home equity that are leaving families owing more than their homes are worth. 
   Bush's job growth record is among the worst of any President since Hoover. As this chart shows, since the Great Depression, only his father has presided over a slower rate of job growth. As you see, the rate of job growth under President Clinton was four times higher than President Bush or Bush's father. 
   Wage growth has been even slower. Wages are up less than 4 percent in real terms since President Bush came into office. This chart shows the contrast between sluggish wage growth and soaring prices for such basic needs as education, health care, and gasoline. These basic costs of living have grown over 10 times faster than wages. 
   Look at this chart. The average wages are up 3.8 percent; public university tuition, 40 percent. Family health insurance premiums are up 46 percent, and a gallon of gas is up 87 percent. Middle class workers are being left behind because their hard work has not translated into bigger paychecks. 
   This chart shows the divergence between strong productivity growth, shown on the top blue line, and much weaker growth in real compensation for ordinary workers, shown in the bottom red line. 
   Workers' productivity and their compensation used to grow together, but now they grow apart, as this chart shows. This was still true as recently as the late 1990s, but it is not true today. So here you see that for decades the productivity per hour and real compensation per hour basically grew together at the same time, at the same rate. But now look at the great difference between the productivity per hour, the output per an average worker, and the real compensation that the average worker takes home. 
   If our increased wealth has not gone to ordinary workers, then where has it gone? One answer is that it has gone to a very few at the top of our economy. The divide between the haves and the have-nots is reaching yet another record, a poor record level. We have the largest gap between the haves and the have-nots in many a long time. This chart shows that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of taxpayers is not at the highest level, 19.4 percent, since the Roaring 20s. 
   The compensation growth that the middle class has received came much more from benefits than from wages. Benefit costs have been increasing because health insurance costs are increasing, are rising up 47 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since 2007. 
   As this chart shows, rising health costs have driven the number and percentage of uninsured Americans to record levels; 47 million Americans are uninsured today, up 8.6 million since President Bush took office. Yet again another unfortunate record from this administration. 
   Slow job growth and stagnant wages during much of the Bush administration have depressed families' real incomes. The typical American family is earning almost $1,000 less than they did when the President took office and after taking inflation into account. As families struggle to make ends meet, they borrowed more and more from their major source of wealth and savings: the equity in their homes. 
   Under the Bush administration, families' equities stake in their homes has declined to the lowest level ever recorded. As housing prices drop, families will no longer be able to draw on this source of income to make up for slow wage and job growth. Yet, the President and his supporters react to these disturbing trends by pressing tax cuts that largely benefit our most fortunate families.  
   This chart shows the distribution of the benefits received from the tax cuts. The tall bar on the right shows that households earning $1 million or more in 2007 income received over 100 times more money in these tax cuts than middle income families did. Incredibly, one-fifth of tax benefits went to these few families who make up just three-tenths of 1 percent of taxpayers. 
   The Bush administration claimed that these tax cuts would drive investment creating growth in wages and employment, but these claims have proven to be false. 
   To make matters worse, the tax cuts have been funded using borrowed money. According to the Brookings Institution, the Federal Government has already borrowed some $1.6 trillion to fund the tax cuts. 
   When President Bush came into office in 2001, he inherited a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. He inherited a government in good financial shape prepared to deal with the budget challenges posed by the retirement of the baby boomer generation and prepared to invest in improving the future standard of living of all of our children and our grandchildren. But this administration has presided over a stunning reversal of fortune. 
   This year our gross Federal debt will top $9.6 trillion, the largest in history, or more. That means that every American owes $30,000 per person to pay off this staggering debt. As a share of our economy, that's the highest level since 1955 when we were paying off debts from World War II. This is the financial mess that we have to clean up. 
   Thanks to the President's policies, we are now a nation of debtors relying on the rest of the world to finance our budget deficits and the cost of the war in Iraq. As former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers has said: There is something very odd about the world's greatest power being the world's greatest debtor. 
   Our current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of our trade deficit with the rest of the world, rose to yet another record, a record smashing $857 billion in 2006. And last year was likely even worse. The amount of Federal debt owned by foreigners has more than doubled under Bush's watch, rising to nearly $2.4 trillion, with Japan and China alone holding 
   more than $1 trillion of our debt. 
   How does the administration address our financial problems? They turn to cuts and benefits from middle and working-class families. The President's proposed some $30 billion in cuts to the Medicaid program. That's a program that provides health care for some 27 percent of our Nation's children. These cuts couldn't come at a worse time. A recent study by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee estimated that should the economy enter into even a mild recession, some 1 million additional children per year would require Medicaid benefits. So these cuts are especially cruel. 
   Even while proposing these cuts and benefits, the administration wishes to continue massive levels of spending on the misguided priorities that landed us in this fiscal mess. The President's budget calls for all of the 2001 and 2006 tax cuts to be made permanent. But Democrats are not about to mortgage anymore of our children's future for all of these irresponsible tax breaks. 
   What is more, we have heard no plans for lessening the enormous fiscal and economic drain created by the mismanaged war in Iraq. This chart shows the steady upward march in the administration's requested spending for the war. That's over $600 billion just so far, with no end in sight. In fact, in this year's 2009 budget, the administration even refuses to tell us what the full-year cost for the war might be. Future costs will be truly massive if the Nation does not change course. 
   The Joint Economic Committee has submitted that over the next decade, a continued presence in Iraq will cost us a total of $1.9 trillion in Federal spending and $2.8 trillion in total impacts on the economy. You can find this report on my Web site. 
   But the good news is that we have a choice. We don't have to continue spending on the misguided priorities of the last 7 years. If we make responsible choices, our government can once again help middle class families improve their quality of life while saving and investing to improve the lives of future generations. 
   Our Democratic Congress has made important progress on this agenda. We have worked with the President to increase the minimum wage, expand Head Start, assist struggling homeowners, and increase opportunities in higher education. We've expanded investments in energy independence, green technology, and America's future competitiveness in science and technology. 
   What is more, we have paid for it all in a fiscally responsible manner. We've also worked with the President to pass an economic stimulus package that was truly targeted to middle class families who needed the assistance most. 
   Unfortunately, the President has blocked progress on many other initiatives. He has vetoed health insurance for America's uninsured kids, a change of course in Iraq he vetoed, and dozens of other bills. We must turn away from the failed policies of the past which has given us record levels of debt, trade deficit, and deficits of the highest records in history and an order to fully deliver on what the economy can do for all Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his testimony, but I want to point out that you have to remember that the Republican Congress and President Bush have been in charge of this economy for 7 years. And when President Bush came into office in 2001, he inherited a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. And he inherited a government in good financial shape, prepared to deal with the budget challenges that the country confronts. And yet under his tenure, under his leadership and a Republican Congress, they turned this surplus into an $8.8 trillion hole, the biggest reversal in history. 
   And we have to remember that President Bush gave us a series of records, but they're the wrong kinds of records. This country now has the largest debt in the history of our country, $9.6 trillion. Each American owes $30,000 of this debt. And we have the largest trade deficit. They have dug us into an $8.8 trillion reversal, and this was given to us by the Bush administration and the Republican Congress.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   To respond to some of the points made by the gentleman from Texas on the high cost of the war, the gentleman from Texas has pointed out that the war is not paid for, that it's off budget, and I support his recommendation that it should not be in a supplemental emergency spending bill. 
   This chart here shows the Federal spending on the Iraq war versus other priorities in the 2008 budget authorization. The Iraq war is costing, the request, twice as much as is in the Federal budget for transportation for the entire country, and it is five times more than what is in the budget now for the National Institutes of Health. It is seven times more than the college tuition assistance. So this is really costing Americans a great deal of money that could be spent on other priorities. 
   This chart here shows that the administration wants to spend $435 million on Iraq every day. And each year that money could be used to enroll for an entire year 57,000 children in Head Start, fund an additional 150,000 Pell Grants for low-income students for an entire year, save 290,000 families from losing their homes. It could hire for an entire year an additional 10,000 Border Patrol agents. It could hire more than 9,000 police officers for a year, and provide health insurance for 330,000 low-income children through the SCHIP program. So, for $435 million that they are requesting for Iraq every day, you could provide for an entire year health insurance for over 330,000 low-income children. 
   So I really want to join my colleague from Texas in his comments on the spending on the war. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to comment on the statement that my good friend and colleague from the State of Tennessee claims that this is the largest tax increase in history. But all we are doing as Democrats is applying the basic rules of fiscal responsibility to expiring tax provisions. 
   Tax cuts should not be financed with borrowing. Tax cuts are not true tax cuts if they are not paid for. We have committed to preserve middle-class tax cuts if they can be properly paid for in 2010. 
   And if I could, Mr. Chairman, I will quote from nonpartisan budget groups that agree that the House budget resolution does not raise taxes. These are nonpartisan groups, The Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institute,  ``The House Budget Committee's budget resolution would not raise taxes.'' The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ``Neither of the plans that the House and the Senate recommended this week by the Budget Committees include a tax increase.'' The Concord Coalition, ``Applying PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, rules to expiring tax cuts does not constitute a tax increase. It constitutes a policy decision requiring a balancing of priorities. That is what budgeting is all about.'' 
   I reserve the balance of my time. I yield to my colleague, Congressman Brady. And we have no other speakers on my side. So after you close, I then will close for my side.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his participation tonight. 
   And I just would like to respond that the Republican budget proposal claims to pay for tax cuts with enormous, but unspecified, cuts in government spending. But when my Republican colleagues were in charge of Congress, along with the President, they did not cut spending. Instead, spending and earmarks grew massively. And so did the Federal debt. 
   My Republican colleagues and the President gave this country a series of records, but they were the wrong kinds of records. They gave us record debt, $9.6 trillion, the largest in the history of this country. So when they talk about financial responsibility, this is what they gave this country when they inherited a surplus. They gave us the largest debt in history. Every American owes $30,000 to this debt. They also gave us the largest trade deficit in history. And they also gave us the largest deficit in history. 
   So what we have before us, Mr. Chairman, is a responsible budget put forward by the Democratic leadership. And, Mr. Chairman, the challenge for this Congress is to return to the fiscal discipline that has been squandered by the President and his party over the past 7 years giving us the largest debt in history. 
   Today, Democrats in Congress present a realistic budget plan that adheres to PAYGO principles. We eliminate President Bush's deficits by 2012 and make the investments necessary to strengthen our economy and make Americans safer. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that under the Clinton administration, every year the deficits got smaller. But under the Bush administration, every year they have gotten larger. Our budget, the Democratic budget, provides health care for millions of additional uninsured children. We make critical investments in defense and our veterans health care. We also restore crucial funding for Medicare and Medicaid, as well as State and local law enforcement programs. 
   In order to spur innovation that will keep America number one, we provide increased funding for math and science education and research. We also expand renewable energy and energy efficiency programs to reduce global warming and our dependence on foreign oil. And we provide new training opportunities to prepare workers for green collar jobs. Our budget makes important investments in infrastructure to begin to rebuild our crumbling bridges and levees. 
   Democrats target tax relief to families struggling to make ends meet in the face of an economic downturn. Our plan extends middle-income tax breaks, including the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief, and we protect 20 million middle-income American families from being snagged by the alternative minimum tax. 
   Mr. Chairman, this budget resolution is an important step towards putting our financial fiscal house back in order and creating greater economic opportunities and prosperity for all American families.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3221, the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. This bill will truly lead us in a new direction. By investing in renewable energy technologies and landmark energy efficiency efforts, we'll be creating millions of green jobs in our economy. With the government taking the lead in reducing greenhouse gases, we'll be setting the right example and setting the bar high. By encouraging high-payoff energy technology R&D, we'll be spurring innovation in solar, geothermal, and marine renewable energy. And by taking steps to increase accountability in the payment of federal oil and gas royalties, we'll be doing more to ensure the American taxpayers are being paid their fair share in royalties from oil and gas companies. 
   One important addition that I believe must be included in the bill is a 15 percent Renewable Electricity Standard. I hope my colleagues will support the Udall amendment to put our Nation on a path toward a clean energy future. 
   Another important improvement to the bill would be the addition of a study of ways to improve the accuracy of collection of federal oil and natural gas royalties. The American taxpayers are possibly being cheated out of billions of dollars in royalties owed to them by energy companies, and an amendment I offered to the Rules committee to ensure such a study would help get taxpayers the royalties they are due. 
   Lawsuits have been filed alleging that energy companies are underpaying billions of dollars in royalties because of these inaccuracies--or possibly because of outright manipulation-- in the process for determining royalty payments. Many of these lawsuits have been settled; and we're talking about a lot of money here: In 2000 and 2001, major oil companies settled with the Justice Department for over half a billion dollars in two False Claims Act lawsuits over oil and royalty underpayments. In 2004, Chevron paid out $111 million to the State of Louisiana for underpayments. In 2005, BP owned up to the tune of $233 in a Colorado case. And, in a case still pending, Exxon Mobil may owe up to $3.6 billion or much more to the State of Alabama for underpayments in royalties there. Certainly, for this kind of money, we can afford to ask the experts who understand the technical issues here to study the major underlying problems. 
   I am disappointed that my amendment was not ruled in order, but I am pleased to have support from Chairman Rahall, in addition to support from the Project on Government Oversight, Taxpayers for Common Sense Action and Friends of the Earth. I thank Chairman Rahall for agreeing to hold a hearing on this issue, and I look forward to working with him toward enacting this provision. 
   Mr. Chairman, the American people are ready to tackle the challenges of global climate change, to get on a path to energy independence, and to be a leader in the world in protecting our planet. They're ready for a New Direction, and I am proud that this Democratic Congress has undertaken the challenge. No one doubts that bringing this important bill to the floor today has been a long and hard fight. I applaud the hard work of all the leaders on this issue and urge all my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (RECOGNIZING THE 187TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my colleague and friend for yielding and for her leadership.  
   As an original cosponsor of this legislation and co-Chair and founder of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic issues, I rise to celebrate the 187th anniversary of Greece's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire. 
   Against incredibly difficult odds, the Greeks defeated one of the most powerful empires in history to win their independence. Following 400 years of Ottoman rule, in March 1821 Bishop Germanos raised the traditional Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting his countrymen to rise up against the Ottoman army. Bishop Germanos' message to his people was clear: A new spirit was about to born in Greece. The following year, the Treaty of Constantinople established full independence of Greece. 
   New York City is home to the largest Hellenic population outside of Greece and Cyprus. Western Queens, which I have the honor of representing, is often called ``Little Athens'' because of the large Hellenic population in that neighborhood.     
   New Yorkers celebrate Greek Independence Day with a parade down Fifth Avenue, along with many cultural events. 
   These events, hosted by the Federation of Hellenic Societies and other Hellenic and philhellenic organizations and friends, remind us of the strong Hellenic American community's many strong contributions to our Nation's history and culture. Relations between the U.S. and Greece remain strong with a shared commitment to ensuring stability in southeastern Europe. I hope permanent solutions can be found for ending the division of Cyprus and finding a mutually agreeable name for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
   We have over 110 cosponsors of my legislation, and with the upcoming NATO summit, the time is more important than ever to find a solution to the name dispute. 
   Additionally, I strongly support the inclusion of Greece in the Visa Waiver Program, and I have legislation before this body on this issue. Greece is the only member of the original 15 European nations not to belong to the Visa Waiver Program, and I was pleased that the administration formally nominated Greece for the Visa Waiver Program this September, and we will continue to monitor Greece's progress. 
   I ask the Nation to join me in celebrating Greece's independence. Additionally, it is my sincere pleasure to pay tribute to New York's Hellenic American community for its many, many contributions to our city and our Nation. ``Zeto E Eleftheria,'' long live freedom. 
   May we join in celebrating Greece's independence and its many contributions to our democracy through its form of government and its history.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, schools will be letting out  soon, and American families will be hitting the road for their summer vacations. But how far will they get this year with sky-high prices at the pump? 
   The average price of regular gasoline is hovering near record highs, and this week stands at about $3.16 a gallon. This means American families are spending nearly $54 on average every time they fill up their tank, an astonishing $30 more per tank since President Bush took office. 
   According to the AAA, the typical American family is on course to spend over $3,600 this year just to fill up their cars if these prices persist. Gasoline prices set a new record of $3.22 a gallon on May 21, according to the AAA's fuel gauge report. Gasoline prices in 34 States broke record highs in the past month. Prices are expected to climb again as the summer driving season progresses. 
   Record high gas prices may not cause hardworking Americans to cancel vacation plans, but they are forcing families to cut back on other spending, putting our economic growth at risk. 
   Wherever I go Americans are asking, why are gas prices so high? Surprisingly, the answer is not because crude oil prices are higher than they were last year. According to the Department of Energy, the largest component of U.S. retail gasoline prices is the price of crude oil. What is unique about the current situation is that crude oil prices, the red line, are lower right now at the onset of the summer driving season than they were at this time last year. But, as we all know, gasoline prices, the blue line, are higher than they were this time last year. 
   The Department of Energy projects that crude oil prices will average $2 less per barrel this summer than last. But they also predict that gasoline will average about $2.95 a gallon this summer, up more than a dime from last summer's $2.84 a gallon on average. Analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that our refinery capacity has failed to keep pace with demand. 
   We haven't had a new refinery built in the United States in 30 years, pushing refineries to operate at capacity levels that are overtaxing the system. Refining costs account for about 22 percent of the retail price of gasoline, up from 15 percent in 2003. 
   With the increase in oil and gas prices over the last several years, refining margins are at historical highs. Refining profits in the first quarter of 2007 increased 36 percent over last year, and the U.S. refining margin increased to over $17 per barrel of refined oil. 
   High gas prices should be an incentive for expanding refining capacity, but instead of building new refineries the industry argues that it has focused on expanding and upgrading existing refineries to keep up with increased demand. 
   U.S. refining capacity has stayed relatively stable over the past few years, and that is the red bar here. But demand has steadily increased, and that is the blue bar. So capacity utilization has risen, regularly reaching levels above 90 to 95 percent of capacity throughout much of the 1990s and continuing into this decade. 
   The problems and risks associated with running near full capacity have become very apparent in recent months. As this chart shows, overtaxed refineries have required unplanned maintenance which has taken supply off line and caused short-term price spikes. Refiners typically perform planned maintenance during off-peak driving season, which impacts available stocks of gasoline when the demand is lower. But the increasing frequency of unplanned maintenance is cause for great concern. Unexpected refinery outages choke off supply and cause price spikes at the pump. 
   A recent spate of such unplanned outages in refineries across the country have made the price spikes a common occurrence and have kept gas prices in the headlines. BP, ConocoPhillips, and Valero Energy have all reported unexpected shutdowns at a number of U.S. refineries. 
   Oil companies certainly have the profits to invest in increased capacity, but they are not investing. With capacity as tight as it is, refiners can boost profits by taking capacity off line, particularly when there is a lack of competition at the refinery level. It is hard to prove that they are purposely limiting supply, but the risk of manipulating capacity to maximize profits is certainly greater with fewer players in the market.     
   Consumer advocates, such as the Consumer's Union Mark Cooper, argued that a lack of competition in the market has enabled oil companies to exploit the tight market they have created by purposefully uninvesting and mismanaging refinery maintenance. 
   With refining margins as high as they are, construction of a new refinery is not a losing proposition, particularly for profit-laden Big Oil companies. But ExxonMobil's CEO, Rex Tillerson, has indicated that he will not build a new refinery in the U.S., pointing to research that U.S. gasoline consumption will plateau in coming years as ethanol and energy efficiency measures become more prevalent. 
   The current runup in gas prices underscores the urgent need for a better national energy policy. But instead, we see stubborn inaction and complicity on the part of the administration. The Bush administration has turned a blind eye to oversight of the oil and gas industry in general, and especially with respect to mergers. Mergers in the gas and oil industry over the past decade have resulted in dangerously concentrated levels of ownership in the U.S. refining market, leaving us with only five major domestic oil companies controlling the majority of our domestic refining capacity. 
   The President has approved mergers at such a break-neck speed that by 2005, the top 10 refiners controlled 81 percent of the market, up from 56 percent since 1993. So it has jumped an astonishing amount. This concentration of refiners has restricted production capacity, causing American consumers to pay more at the pump than they would be with more market competition. The lack of competition is hurting consumers now and will hurt our economy in the future. 
   As a first step toward protecting consumers, the House passed the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act just before the Memorial Day weekend. This legislation will provide relief to consumers by giving the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of energy. It would ensure the Federal Government has the tools it needs to adequately respond to energy emergencies and prohibit price gouging. With a priority on refineries and Big Oil companies, especially during a time of national crisis such as Hurricane Katrina, the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act will provide the FTC with new authority to investigate and prosecute those that engage in predatory or unconscionable pricing from oil companies on down to local gas stations, with an emphasis on those who profit most. This includes the gouging of gasoline, home heating oil, propane or natural gas. It will enpower the Federal Government to impose tough civil penalties of up to triple damages of all excess profits from companies that have cheated consumers. 
   Until we have abundant renewable energy alternatives to benefit consumers, in the short term Congress must carefully look at the current market framework to see what can be done to improve competition in the marketplace. At the refinery level, Congress should look at strengthening antitrust laws, changing the way oil mergers are reviewed by U.S. antitrust agencies, cracking down on anticompetitive actions by oil companies, and/or improving price transparency at the wholesale level. 
   Mr. Speaker, high gas prices is an issue that has a supply side and a demand side, and we need to address both. Government leaders and businesses are recognizing the need to reduce our dependency on oil by making our vehicles more fuel efficient and investing in clean, renewable energy sources and technologies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I request additional time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last month, it was announced in my home district that New York City cabs are going green,  as the Mayor plans to replace the city's fleet with hybrid cars by 2012. 
   The Joint Economic Committee recently released a report entitled, ``Money in the Bank, Not in the Tank'', which argues that we have to take the issue of improving fuel efficiency seriously. 
   America's cars were more efficient two decades ago when our fleet-wide average was 26.2 miles per gallon. Now, our fleet-wide average for cars and trucks has slipped to 25.4 miles per gallon. Clearly, we're going in the wrong direction. 
   And it's hurting our competitiveness--our nation ranks at the bottom of the list of industrialized nations when it comes to fuel efficiency. 
   In Europe, fuel efficiency averages around 40 miles per gallon and they're looking to raise it to 51 miles per gallon by 2012. Japan is trying to get to 50 miles per gallon by 2010 across their fleet. 
   If we raised CAFE standards to 35 miles a gallon from 27.5 miles per gallon, the average American family would reduce their spending on gas by nearly one-quarter. 
   With families on course to spend more than $3,600 on average filling up their cars this year, this would be a savings of $900 a year. 
   Despite major technology gains, especially hybrid technologies, and record-breaking gas prices, we are decades behind when it comes to making our cars more efficient. 
   More efficient cars mean American families spend less at the pump, we're less dependent on foreign oil, and our environment benefits from lower emissions. 
   The President's priority has been to give tax breaks to oil and gas companies even as their profits have soared to new heights. The big five oil companies enjoyed eye-popping profits of $120 billion last year. 
   Instead of using those profits to expand refining capacity or make serious investments in renewable energy, the big oil companies are buying back their own stock to enhance prices for their shareholders. 
   Moreover, oil companies seem to be working hard to prevent gasoline alternatives, such as ethanol-based products, from being pumped at their branded gas stations. 
   In our first 100 hours of work in the majority, the House voted to roll back $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies for Big Oil companies and reinvest that money here at home in clean alternative fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   We have also passed a bill that encourages research and development of markets for biofuels. 
   Speaker PELOSI has created a Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming to develop policy initiatives and assure that progress is made toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Democrats in Congress are working on legislation to protect consumers and increase our energy independence by investing in renewable energy sources and reducing global warming emissions. 
   We need this new direction for energy policy that brings relief to American families and strengthens our economy.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and for his extraordinary leadership on this extremely important housing stimulus package. It is good for the country and good for my constituents in New York City. I strongly support it.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for this Housing Stimulus Package. 
   It is good for our country and it is good for my constituents in New York. 
   We all know we are facing a housing crisis. 
   Foreclosures are at record highs, wages are stagnant and the markets continue to be volatile. 
   This housing package will help restore order and provide the roadmap forward. 
   In addition to the $300 billion voluntary program that would permit FHA to provide up to $300 billion in new guarantees to help refinance at-risk borrowers into viable mortgages, we are doing a number of things to help the mortgage market. 
   We are making permanent the current FHA and GSE loan limits we passed as part of our first stimulus package. 
   Without this limit, the FHA limit in New York City would drop from $729,750 to $362,000 and the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac limit would drop from $729,000 to $417,000. 
   This bill modernizes the reverse mortgage provision administered by FHA, allowing co-ops to be included for the first time. 
   We are preserving affordable FHA-insured foreclosed multifamily projects. Including language important to New York City. 
   This bill includes an amendment I offered that will provide for higher loan limits on homes that include a licensed child care facility. 
   This bill is needed. It helps our communities and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank my dear colleague, Mr. Garrett, on the other side of the aisle for your strong support for the TRIA bill and for coming to New York for that very important hearing. It is a challenge that both of our States face, and I congratulate your leadership on that very important measure. 
   But, regrettably, I rise in opposition. I do not see this amendment as straightforward and helping the process. It appears to just complicate it. It sets triggers and hoops that you have to jump through before we can get to a vote. 
   The underlying purpose of this bill is to allow shareholders to have a vote on a link between pay and performance. If a CEO is doing an absolutely fabulous job and coming up with new ideas and creating new industries and employing thousands and thousands of Americans, as a shareholder, I would probably vote a big pay increase.     
   But if that CEO was like New Century, where the CEO recently, I think was in the paper today, this gentleman walked away with a multimillion-dollar bonus and $13 million of profit in stock options while his company went bankrupt, and thousands of their borrowers are facing the loss of their homes. As a shareholder, I would be voting, very strongly, ``no'' on that pay package. 
   To me, the underlying thrust of this is to allow the voice of shareholders in the democracy of their companies and our country and to tie pay to performance. As a shareholder, I would vote for a large pay increase to someone who is doing a good job. But too often we hear about people who are doing a terrible job, bankrupting pensions, running their companies into the ground. With their cronies on the board, and their close friends walking away with these huge packages, it's really not good for the country, it's not good for capitalism, it's not good for business. 
   This proposal also would increase the cost and length of the time for both the firms and the SEC. The SEC is overburdened now, but this puts more burdens on them to collect the data and calculate the 10 percent that is required before they come forward and make the decision. 
   I join my colleagues. This was roundly defeated in the committee earlier, and I believe it should be defeated on the floor. 
   I would like to speak just a little bit about what I am so deeply concerned about, and why I think this is such an important bill. Like many of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the rising economic inequality in this country. Under the Bush administration, it has just gone like that. I don't think it's good for the country or for our future. 
   Despite 5 years of economic expansion, most American families have struggled just to hold their economic ground on President Bush's watch. Strong productivity growth has not translated into higher wages for most American workers. Those who were already well-to-do are those who continue to grow. 
   As this chart shows, and I think it's an important one, the red bar shows only modest gains concentrated in the upper half of the distribution from 2000 to 2006. The divergence between the haves and the have-nots and the Bush economy stands in marked contrast to the second term of the Clinton administration. The blue bars, where real  wages and gains were strong up and down the economic ladder for all people, the economy grew, not just for the top, but for all of our citizens. 
   The people experiencing the largest wage gains are executives and highly compensated individuals. While ordinary workers are not really sharing in this economic growth, their paychecks have not really grown after inflation. 
   I want to show the CEO chart, because it goes really to part of this bill. Now, this chart shows the compensation, as the bar on the left shows, in the 1980s, the average CEO made about 50 times as much as the average worker. As the bar on the right shows in 2004, that ratio was seven times greater. The average CEO made about 350 times the pay of the average worker. 
   According to recent studies, that figure has only gone up. The average CEO made 500 times the pay of the average worker in 2006. I say that it's time for shareholders to have a say and that this underlying bill is long overdue. 
   I congratulate Chairman Frank for his effort here. It's measured, it's reasonable, and it will enhance shareholder democracy and rein in the excesses of executive compensation. 
   I would just like to conclude, the main reason I am opposed to your amendment, Mr. Garrett, although I have a great deal of respect for your work and we have agreed in many ways, is, it does not link the pay to performance. That is what we want to get to the shareholders. That is what is good for economic growth for our country. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding and congratulate him on this resolution and all of his hard work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I want to thank Chairman Hinojosa and Congresswoman Biggert for their leadership in this area as co-chairs of the bipartisan Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus. 
   As this resolution states, we need to work to encourage government and private sector initiatives to enhance financial literacy. Given the current turmoil in the financial markets, the housing crisis, increasing credit card indebtedness and the economic downturn, it is very important that all Americans become better educated and more responsible financial consumers. 
   Financial literacy is important for many reasons, not the least of which is to learn how to save. As some point out, we have lost that ability. The Department of Commerce reports that personal saving as a percentage of disposable income, already low, declined to zero in the fourth quarter of 2007, and with the economic downturn, the situation will likely get worse. We need to help individuals develop personal savings skills, and this resolution will encourage them to do so. 
   The deregulation of financial markets and the rapid increase in the number and complexity of financial products stump even the most financially savvy. We know that financial literacy is especially low for certain groups, such as those with lower educational attainment and low income. If you don't understand how finance charges on mortgages, credit cards or car loans work, you can't make decisions that help you, and these decisions could push you further into debt without you realizing it. 
   The efforts of our school system are uneven, and we need to encourage them. In its 2007 Survey of the States, the National Council of Economic Education found that only 41 States require economic standards to be implemented in the high school curriculum, only 17 States actually require an economics course for graduation, only 22 States actually test students' knowledge of economics, only seven States require that students take a personal finance course for graduation, and only nine States actually test students' knowledge of personal finance. 
   Just last month, the Jump$tart Coalition released its annual study, which found that the 2008 high school senior class knows less about principles of basic personal finance than their 2006 counterparts. This does not bode well for their ability to manage their finances as a result. 
   This resolution shows our commitment to improving financial literacy through both public and private sector efforts. I urge my colleagues to support it. I congratulate the authors, and I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for their efforts in moving it through the committee.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (FINANCIAL CONSUMER HOTLINE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 4332, the Financial Consumers Hotline Act of 2008, which has received strong bipartisan support from the Financial Services Committee. 
   The bill establishes a single toll-free telephone number that consumers can call if they have a problem with their bank and want to speak to someone who can help them. 
   Given that depository institutions in the United States can be regulated by any of five Federal regulators or a State regulator, consumers often don't know what entity to call if they have a problem with their account. 
   In a hearing in my subcommittee, the regulators and consumer groups testified that customers often end up calling their Attorney General. Since State authority over national banks has been preempted by the Federal OCC, AGs can't help in this category. 
   This legislation builds on a suggestion that Comptroller Dugan put forward to provide consumers with a single number to call to get help with their banking issues, and we drafted it in close consultation with all five regulators. 
   As the OCC, the FDIC, and the OTS all testified, this legislation will be cost efficient as well as consumer friendly. I should note that CBO came out with an estimate last week. The bill would have no significant effect on direct spending or revenues. So this legislation can help our constituents without spending any money. 
   Right now, each of the agencies has a Web site and provides a phone number for consumers to call with questions and has a staff to follow up on complaints or inquiries, some of which may be unique to their responsibilities. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has systems in place to respond to consumer inquiries about deposit insurance and bank failures. 
   This bill would not replace these existing consumer response systems, but helps consumers find them. It adds a simple one-stop routing method to minimize confusion for consumers who are unclear about where to call for help and directs them to the right agency for specialized assistance. The establishment of a single toll-free number will help encourage greater use of the agency's resources to help their consumers. 
   Establishment of a single toll-free number will also assist the banking regulators in compiling consumer complaints and inquiries so that better information would be available about problems or issues that cut across the institutions that the various agencies supervise. It would help governments spot developing problems. Congressional legislation and oversight would  also be better informed by such centralized statistics. 
   This legislation directs the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to set up the hotline. The Council is an existing interagency body established by statute to prescribe uniform principles and standards for financial institutions and to otherwise coordinate regulatory activity among the Federal banking regulators. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, OCC, and OTS are all members of the Council. 
   The legislation also directs the Council to work with State banking regulators to integrate them into the hotline service. And, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors testified that they have already started to implement such a plan. The act also requires the Council to report to Congress 6 months after enactment on the agency's efforts to establish a public interagency Web site, likewise directing and referring consumer complaints and inquiries received on the Internet concerning any financial institution to the appropriate Federal or State financial institution regulatory agency. 
   I should note that not only the OCC but the Council as a whole has taken some steps in this direction on its own initiative, with an eye to both cutting costs and improving service to consumers. Last summer, the Council formed a working group to study ways in which the separate consumer complaint handling systems of each regulator could be streamlined and leveraged to better and more efficiently serve consumers. 
   With this legislation, we give consumers a statutory mandate and a timetable to support and guide these efforts, as well as a framework for congressional oversight. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the Chair and the ranking member and subcommittee Ranking Member Biggert and many others for their help on this legislation. I urge a ``yea'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (PREPARE ALL KIDS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, this week I introduce the House companion to Senator Casey's Prepare All Kids Act of 2007. This bill is designed to help States expand their pre-K programs and child care services. 
   As this chart shows, we get the biggest bang for our education dollars by investing in our children before they even go to school. Estimates show that the return on investing in early care in education is between 17 to 18 percent annually. If this were a stock, all of Wall Street would be buying it. 
   The legislation is very helpful to the children we represent in our States. For example, more than one-quarter of a million 4-year-olds in New York State would be eligible for the programs created in this bill, including 100,000 children who would qualify for free pre-K. The future prosperity of our Nation rests on setting our children on a path for success early in life.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act (CHAMP Act). 
   This important legislation will provide health care to 11 million children by reauthorizing and strengthening the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
   Insuring America's children is an affordable goal. It costs less than $3.50 a day--about the cost of a Starbucks Frappuccino--to cover a child through CHIP. Certainly we can all agree that this is an investment worth making. 
   In addition to providing health coverage to children, this bill strengthens Medicare to ensure beneficiaries have access to their doctors and improves benefits to cover preventative and mental health services. 
   This bill lays the groundwork for a long-term solution to the physician payment system. 
   Medicare physician payment rates are set to be cut by 10 percent in 2008 and a 5 percent cut each year thereafter under current law. This bill eliminates pending cuts and enacts a .5 percent increase in both 2008 and 2009. 
   Congress has a responsibility to protect our children's access to affordable health care and strengthen Medicare for patients and physicians. 
   This bill accomplishes both these goals. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his strong and creative leadership in the passage of this tremendously important bill for American homeowners and for those who are in desperate need of affordable housing. 
   I wish to be associated with the comments of Mr. Frank and Mr. Gary Miller on these conforming loan limits in high income areas such as the area I represent in New York City. It's very important for affordable housing. 
   Keeping with the bipartisan spirit of the Financial Services Committee, this bill was reported out with a strong bipartisan vote of 45-19, and when it passes today, it will completely overhaul and strengthen the regulatory oversight of the GSEs, the government-sponsored enterprises, of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banking System, and it will create a new independent regulator with broad powers, similar to those of current banking regulators. 
   It also requires Fannie and Freddie to establish an Affordable Housing Fund, something that should have been done long ago. It's important for affordable housing in our country, and I congratulate the leadership of Mr. Frank and Mr. Baker and Mr. Oxley in moving this fund forward. Contributions will be based on the average total mortgage portfolio which will include all mortgages, whether held for investment or securitized. It will be distributed through the States. 
   And very importantly, the first year the money will go to the ravaged area of Katrina and Rita where people are living without housing. It is tremendously important. It is creative and it addresses a desperate need in our country. 
   In addition to the affordable housing goals that apply to Fannie and Freddie, we enhanced the bill in a number of ways, including a provision that I sponsored along with Mr. Baker, to encourage the creation of home-based child care centers. My Kiddie Mac amendment will do that. It will make day care more affordable and available. 
   I congratulate everyone. Please vote for this bill.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. Since 1965, the Head Start early childhood education program has provided low-income children with comprehensive child development, educational, health, nutritional, and social activities to ensure that they are ready to enter kindergarten on an equal playing field with other children. H.R. 1429 will expand and improve the successful Head Start program, which research has shown works in raising children's achievement. 
   I want to thank Representatives KILDEE, CASTLE and Chairman MILLER for their outstanding leadership on this bipartisan bill, which would allow as many as 10,000 more children to access the benefits Head Start. It improves classroom and teacher quality, raising the qualifications of teachers and increasing funding for teacher and staff salaries and professional development. The bill also includes strong accountability measures to better ensure that Head Start funds are used appropriately and efficiently and that underperforming programs are either replaced or quickly improved. 
   As a former educator, I understand the importance of closing the school-readiness gap and ensuring that all children can start their education on an equal playing field. Today, we have the opportunity to pass a bill that will make great strides toward just that.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (ADDRESSING THE SUBPRIME MELTDOWN -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we are at a critical juncture with respect to the subprime mortgage crisis. I see my colleagues here on the floor that are members of the Financial Services Committee and other important committees that have been working with the Democratic leadership and the Democratic Congress to help families stay in their homes and prevent another crisis like this from happening in the future. 
   Today, I joined with House and Senate leaders and colleagues in urging the President to join us in aggressively working to turn back the tide of foreclosures. Parallels have been drawn between this administration's management of the subprime crisis and Hurricane Katrina, when some 300,000 people lost their homes. Millions of Americans may lose their homes to foreclosure as a result of the subprime mortgage meltdown. And once again the response from the Bush administration has been slow and small. 
   This crisis requires a bolder response. Foreclosures have spiked nearly 115 percent since this time last year, and expectations are that the next 18 months will be even worse as many subprime loans reset to higher rates. Some economists think that the collapse of home prices that we will see might be the most severe since the Great Depression. The worsening housing slump, the credit crunch, and weak consumer confidence point to a gathering storm that could drag down the economy, taking thousands of American jobs with it. 
   As losses mount for borrowers and lenders, economic pain is already being felt in communities across this country as the ripple of default spreads to local economies, governments and neighborhoods. The time to act is now. 
   Under Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank's leadership, the House swiftly passed legislation that will enable the FHA to serve more subprime borrowers at affordable rates and terms, and offer refinancing to homeowners struggling to meet their mortgage payments. The President should sign that bill the minute it gets to his desk. 
   We have passed also important GSE reforms in the House, but we should also raise the cap on their portfolio limits at least temporarily so that they can provide additional liquidity and help with the subprime crisis. If there was ever a time for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to have more liquidity to help people, it is now. 
   The caseloads for nonprofits aiding strapped borrowers are growing larger by the day. The Joint Economic Committee, which I am honored to serve on, reported earlier this year that it cost $1,500 to prevent a foreclosure of a single family home. And that's the first thing that we should be doing is keeping people in their home, helping them stay there. And that shows what it's like for one family home, only $1,500. But foreclosure prevention specialists are absolutely in critical need of more resources in order to save more homes. 
   Foreclosures have a significant negative impact on entire communities because of lower property values, decreased property tax revenues, and higher municipal maintenance costs. In fact, we estimate that the total cost of each foreclosure to the community can be up to $227,000, as the right-hand column shows. 
   The impact of these foreclosures will be devastating on African American and Hispanic owners, as 52 percent of all mortgage loans sold to African Americans and 40 percent of those sold to Latinos were subprime over the last 2 years. The sad irony here is that up to 40 percent of subprime borrowers, they would qualify for prime fixed-rate loans. We need to help them renegotiate their loans and get into the prime, more affordable loans. Securing additional funds for foreclosure prevention is critical to bringing subprime borrowers and lenders together to achieve loan workouts. 
   For $200 million in Federal Foreclosure Prevention Funding, which passed the Senate this month, 130,000 families, let me just show this one thing that is happening, Mr. Speaker. For $200 million, we can save a lot of people and keep them in their homes, and yet we're spending that much in Iraq. 
   The sad irony here is that up to 40 percent of subprime borrowers would qualify for prime, fixed-rate loans.  
   Securing additional funds for foreclosure prevention is critical to bringing subprime borrowers and lenders together to achieve loan workouts. 
   For $200 million in federal foreclosure prevention funding, which passed the Senate this months, 130,000 families could be helped to avoid foreclosure, as the bar on the left shows. 
   That is less than the cost of the Administration's Iraq war spending for one day, which is now about $330 million and to rise, as the big red bar on the right shows. 
   To help the two million households that are at risk of foreclosure would cost one week of our spending in Iraq. 
   We invite President Bush to join us in our efforts to aggressively help protect and expand the American dream of home ownership. 
   Mr. Speaker, the price of doing nothing is just too high.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 928, the ``Improving Government Accountability Act.'' I commend Chairman WAXMAN for his leadership on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I am a member, and for his efforts to ensure that the government is working for the American people. This legislation includes provisions of a bill that I introduced earlier this year which will provide for the enhanced protection of the Internal Revenue Service and its employees. 
   In 1998, Congress passed the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, which created the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). The legislation gave TIGTA the responsibility for protecting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) against external attempts to corrupt or threaten IRS employees. At the same time, it excluded the provision of providing ``physical security'' from TIGTA's responsibilities. 
   Prior to the enactment of this law, the former IRS Inspection Service had been responsible for protecting the IRS against external attempts to corrupt or threaten IRS employees. The IRS Inspection Service was responsible for providing armed escorts for IRS employees who were specifically threatened or who were contacting individuals designated as ``Potentially Dangerous Taxpayers.'' The law transferred most of those duties to the new Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Inexplicably, ``physical security'' was excluded from TIGTA's statutory responsibilities. 
   In its current statutory mission, TIGTA investigates all allegations of threats or assaults involving IRS employees and assists U.S. Attorneys' offices with appropriate prosecutions. However, if TIGTA determines that any of the threats or assaults it investigates call for the provision of physical security, the language of the 1998 law precludes TIGTA from taking action. 
   Authorizing TIGTA to have armed escort authority would be both more efficient and more effective in advancing tax administration and ensuring the safety of IRS employees. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member DAVIS for their support of this provision, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 928.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the Speaker from the great State of New York for yielding me this time on this incredibly important issue. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, as we approach the sixth anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today about one of the most important issues facing my district, my hometown of New York City and our Nation. 
   I am so proud to be here today with my colleague and good friend from Manhattan, JERRY NADLER, who has been a tireless advocate for everyone who has become sick from the toxins of 9/11. His district includes Ground Zero, and our work together on this issue can truly move this forward. 
   I want to note that a number of New Yorkers will be with me today, Congressman Fossella, Yvette Clarke, John Hall, Eliot Engel. And Steve Israel, if he was not in the Chair being the Speaker, he would be down here on the floor talking about the six men and women from 9/11 who need our help, and possibly Chairman Pallone. 
   Mr. Speaker, the death toll from 9/11 is still growing, and the nightmare of that day has continued for thousands of our fellow Americans who are suffering with illnesses and injuries caused by the attacks, but are not getting the help they need. 
   When people hear that the men and women who rushed in to save the lives of others on that terrible day, who worked to clean up the site, who worked in construction, I remember that day there were signs everywhere, ``iron workers, report for duty,'' retired workers, all workers to the site. These men and women rushed to the site thinking of others, not of themselves; and many of them are sick and they need our help now. 
   The collapse of the World Trade Center towers took nearly 3,000 lives in an instant and released a massive cloud of asbestos, pulverized concrete and other poisons. These toxins have sickened thousands and have killed at least eight, but likely dozens more Americans, in the years since 9/11. 
   On 9/11, 500 of my neighbors and constituents lost their lives. That was more than any other district. We lost up to 3,000 people, but thousands and thousands more lost their health; and we need to be there to help them now. 
   The gray dust that billowed through Lower Manhattan that day is said to have been as caustic as drain cleaner. It settled in the homes of Lower Manhattan, in downtown schools, playgrounds and parks, and in the lungs of tens of thousands of Americans. These forgotten victims of 9/11 either lived or worked downtown, courageously volunteered for rescue and recovery operations at Ground Zero, or merely happened to be in Lower Manhattan, a school child, a worker, on one of the worst mornings our country has ever known. And right now, more than 6,500 responders, truly the heroes and heroines of 9/11, are being treated for 9/11-related health problems through the federally funded World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program. And more than 5,000 have been referred for mental health care, often for conditions like post-traumatic stress syndrome. Every month, another 500 to 1,000 responders sign up for health monitoring, and those coming in are more sick than ever before. 
   In all, more than 70,000 Americans reported to the World Trade Center Health Registry, and they were near Ground Zero in the days following 9/11 and have serious concerns about their health. 
   As you would expect, the majority of those registered are from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. But what many people may not know is that more than 10,000 Americans from outside the tri-state area have also signed up for the registry. Amazingly, every single State and 431 of the 435 congressional districts nationwide have someone in the World Trade Center Registry in New York City. This is a health emergency on a national scale, and it requires a strong Federal response. 
   This Saturday at Ground Zero, many of us on the floor here this afternoon will be joining the working men and women of New York City's labor movement in a rally to send a message loud and clear that the time is now to support our heroes of 9/11. Six years is long enough. 
   Along with the New York State AFL-CIO, the New York City Central Labor Council and the Building and Construction Trades Council, we will be showing honor, support and respect for the contributions and sacrifices of the heroes and heroines of 9/11. And we will be rallying for action from the government to care for the thousands of people who have become sick because of the toxins of Ground Zero. 
   With the strong support of the AFL-CIO, Representative Nadler and I are preparing to introduce, along with Congressman Fossella and many others, new comprehensive legislation to do just that. The 9/11 Health and Compensation Act will ensure that everyone exposed to the Ground Zero toxins has a right to be medically monitored, and all who are sick as a result have a right for treatment. 
   It will build on the expertise of the Centers for Excellence, which are currently providing high-quality care to thousands of responders and ensuring an ongoing data collection and analysis, expanding care to the entire exposed community. 
   The bill also includes care for area residents, workers, and school children, as well as the thousands of people that came from across the country to assist with recovery and clean-up efforts. 
   Finally, it provides compensation for economic damages and loss by reopening the September 11, 2001 Victims Compensation Fund. I have been working for years to make this happen, along with all of the members of the New York delegation. And I am very proud to be working with Representative Nadler, with the strong support of the New York AFL-CIO, to move this comprehensive, bipartisan bill through Congress. 
   We are united as a delegation; we are united with labor; we are united at the various levels of government, and we are truly committed. We will not stop, and we will continue to work every single day and hour to make sure that this happens. Six years, six long years is long enough for the men and women who are sick because they rushed into burning buildings to save the lives of others, to work on a deadly pile where the toxins infected their lungs. 
   Once again, the 9/11 health crisis is a national emergency that was caused by an attack on our country. Only the Federal Government has the resources and the reach to properly address the health and compensation needs of thousands of Americans from across this Nation whose health was compromised by the World Trade Center attacks. 
   I must say that we would not have moved forward as we have with some funding and some help without the complete support of the Democratic  leadership. Chairman Obey, who has put money in the appropriations bill, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, who has met with the sick and injured workers many, many times here in the Capitol, along with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and others. This is a united Democratic and Republican effort to help the sick people that are sick because of the attack on America. 
   The solutions I have outlined this afternoon are neither easy nor inexpensive, but they are part of our country's moral obligation. As the wealthiest country in the world, it is our duty to care for those who responded to an act of war. These were the first veterans of the act of war. They are veterans; they should be treated with health care. We must take care of the people who took care of us following 9/11. Many risked their lives, and many, many more risked their health. It is the least we can do as a grateful Nation. The time to act is now. Six years is long enough. 
   I would now like to recognize my colleague and dear friend from the Lower East Side who has been a tireless advocate for everyone who has become sick from the toxins. His district includes Ground Zero. And our work together on this issue can truly move this issue forward. 
   Congressman Nadler is recognized for 5 minutes.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for his moving statement. 
   Mr. Speaker, the New York Daily News editorial board won the Pulitzer Prize for its groundbreaking series of editorials entitled ``9/11, The Forgotten Victims'' which documented the growing medical fallout from the World Trade Center attacks. Since this is really about the sick heroes and heroines of 9/11, not about legislation or legislators, I would like to share an excerpt from this award-winning series. This is from part 1 of the series entitled, ``Abandoned Heroes,'' which was originally published in 2006. 
   I quote, ``They cough, they wheeze, their heads and faces pound with the pressure of swollen sinuses. They lose their breath with minor exertion. They suffer the suffocation of asthma and diseases that attack the very tissues of their lungs. They endure acid reflux, a painful indigestion that never goes away. They are haunted by the mental and emotional traumas of having witnessed horror. Many are too disabled to work. And some have died.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to my colleague and friend from the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from New York, Vito Fossella, who has worked very hard to get funding for the heroes of 9/11, including $25 million in the President's budget.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that we are now approaching the sixth anniversary and there are a number of committees here in the House that will be looking closely at this issue. 
   I want to thank Chairman Pallone of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce for holding a very important hearing on the health effects on the day of the anniversary. Many of his constituents rushed down to Ground Zero in the aftermath of 9/11, and they are now very sick. In fact, one of the Centers of Excellence providing monitoring and treatment to sick workers is located in Congressman Pallone's district. 
   There will be no greater champion, no one more important for the sick workers of 9/11 than Frank Pallone and Chairman Dingell. I thank them for their hard work. 
   Also, Chairman Towns, my dear friend from Brooklyn, will be holding a field hearing in New York City on Monday in his Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management. This is the third hearing this year that the chairman has held on making sure that everyone exposed to the deadly toxins is monitored and everyone who is sick is treated. His dedication to helping the residents, area workers and schoolchildren and those who came from across the country to help is tremendous. 
   Last, our friend and true leader in the Congress, Chairman Miller of the Education and Labor Committee, is delving into why workers were not protected while working at and around Ground Zero. On Wednesday of next week his full committee will hold an important hearing, the first in a series, with the second focusing on why workers were not protected after Hurricane Katrina. I thank my dear friend for his ongoing focus and support for this issue. 
   It is clear that this Congress will not allow the heroes of 9/11 to go longer without the care they need and deserve. Six years is long enough. 
   We now have one of our other distinguished colleagues from New York, Steve Israel. He serves on the Appropriations Committee. Along with Chairman Obey, he worked to secure $100 million in this year's budget for the sick workers. We thank him for his commitment and support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my dear friend and colleague from the State of New York, Congressman Israel.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for raising the issue of his two constituents with whom he has worked. It brings a personal face on the tragic horror that many people confront. 
   I also want to particularly commend him for his work on the Appropriations Committee. In addition to the comprehensive legislation that we are jointly putting in as a delegation, Mr. Israel and others on the Appropriations Committee have taken a lead in providing funding. In recent months, because of his efforts and those of others, we have passed appropriations bills to make sure that federally financed 9/11 health clinics, including those run by Mount Sinai and the New York City Fire Department, do not have to shut their doors because of lack of funding. 
   We included $50 million for 9/11 health clinics in the recent war supplemental spending measure and the House-passed Labor-HHS appropriations bill. This was done by Mr. Israel's committee. I mentioned a moment ago that this included another $50 million for 9/11 health needs. In the Senate version of the Labor-HHS bill, Senators Clinton, Schumer and others have gotten $55 million into the Senate bill. So when this appropriations bill gets signed into law, we in Congress will have provided at least $100 million for 9/11 health needs this year alone. 
   This is a very good start. Thank you so much, Steve. It is a testimony to the leadership not only of Steve, but of the two Senators, our entire New York delegation, our Democratic leadership, and I would say very importantly, I would say Congressman Obey, for his leadership in this battle for funding. We will continue the fight to ensure that the heroes of 9/11 have access to the health care that they deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my distinguished colleague and friend, John Hall, of New York's Nineteenth District. He represents the Hudson Valley. He has just been elected to Congress, but he is fighting just as hard as all of us who have suffered from 9/11 to make sure that the health care needs of the wounded are taken care of. I thank him for joining me in this Special Order and for his hard work.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his outstanding work on this issue and many others. I rise in strong support of the rule for H.R. 2831. 
   In the Ledbetter case, the Supreme Court has outdone itself. Against reason, against logic, against fairness, they ruled that women must file their claim a scant 180 days from the date on which their salary first became unequal. In a world where most workers do not know what their colleagues are earning, the 180-day rule is an insurmountable barrier with terrible consequences. Miss the deadline and you're stuck with discrimination for the rest of your career. 
   What's more, since raises are often based on a percentage of pay, small differences magnify over time. Under the Supreme Court's twisted reasoning, employees cannot contest this growing disparity if they don't protest at the beginning. 
   This bill restores reason, logic and fairness to the process. Every unequal paycheck ought to be recognized for what it is, a new act of discrimination. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the fair underlying bill. I congratulate the Democratic leadership for coming forward with it, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule.

   Most women work outside the home, including over 70 percent of all mothers. Yet among full-time workers, women earn only 77 percent compared to men. Unequal pay practices hurt not only women but their entire families. The typical wife brings home about one-third of her family's income. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will help prevent, regulate, and reduce discrimination against women. It will prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their coworkers, as we saw in the Lilly Ledbetter case. 
   Women's work should be valued equally. This bill is an important step towards gender equality. And I thank my colleagues, Rosa, George, and many others, for their hard work on it.  
   Most women are in the labor force, including over 70 percent of all mothers. Yet, women continue to earn less than men even if they have similar educational levels and work in similar kinds of jobs. 
   A 2003 Government Accountability Office (GAO) study that I commissioned showed that when occupation, marital status, job tenure, industry, and race are accounted for, women still earn 80 cents for every dollar men earn. 
   Research has found that women's choices cannot explain about 40 percent of the wage gap between men and women. 
   Pay discrimination hurts not only a working woman, but her entire family--especially in the face of rising prices for basics, like food and gasoline. 
   The typical wife brings home about a third of her family's total income. Over the past three decades, only those families who have a working wife have seen real increases in family income: Families without a working wife have real incomes today that are nearly identical to what they were over 35 years ago. 
   Congress passed the Equal Pay Act nearly half a century ago, yet women still experience pay discrimination. 
   According to the National Committee on Pay Equity, working women stand to lose $250,000 over the course of their career because of unequal pay practices. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will prevent, regulate and reduce pay discrimination for working women nationwide. It will help women become better negotiators, enforce equal pay laws for federal contractors, and require the Department of Labor to work with employers to eliminate pay disparities. 
   As we saw in the Lilly Ledbetter case, if a woman doesn't know how much her male colleagues earn, she cannot know that she is being discriminated against. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co-workers. 
   Women need to know the true value of the jobs that they do and this is an important step towards gender parity. 
   I strongly urge you to vote yes on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I thank very much the gentleman's yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on protecting taxpayers' money by better oversight of our contracting policies. And I congratulate former Chairman Davis and Chairman Waxman on the Accountability in Contracting Act that we are passing today. 
   I feel so strongly about it because if we really manage our dollars better,  then we will have more dollars for the services that we need for our people. And I urge all of my colleagues and all of my constituents and really the listening public to read this excellent report that has come out from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on ``Dollars, not Sense: Government Contracting Under the Bush Administration.'' And it shows that sole source contracts have absolutely ballooned. They have grown dramatically from $67 billion in 2000 to over $145 billion in 2005. These are contracts that only one person gets. It is as if I handed you a lollipop. It is giving someone billions and billions of dollars, and I believe there are many talented businesses, many talented individuals in this country that should deserve the right to compete for these contracts. 
   This bill makes it easier for them to compete and, I believe, will save taxpayers dollars by the billions. It says if we give Halliburton or some other company a sole source no-bid contract worth billions and billions of dollars, then they have to tell us why we should give it to them. They have to file a document called the Justification and Approval Document. That is the least that we can do for the American taxpayer, to build in some transparency and some accountability. It also has many other important reforms in it. 
   But I must say of all the areas of mismanagement, contracting may look dull, but it is billions of dollars that if we were better stewards, we would have those dollars for education and health care. 
   I commend the chairman for his leadership on cracking down on this waste, fraud, and abuse and really shoddy mismanagement that has ballooned into billions of sole source contracts. 
   If you read this report, it is really chilling.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his extraordinary leadership and for yielding. 
   I would like to respond to some of the comments of my good friend on the other side of the aisle and to remind my colleagues that New York, and he mentioned it several times in his statement, was attacked not as a city, and our State was not attacked as a State. This was a national attack against our country, at our Pentagon, a symbol of our military strength, and New York, one of the symbols of our economic strength. And after that attack, this body was united and determined, and I thank all of my colleagues for your aid and support. 
   But the most important act by this body to get New York moving again and our other economic centers was voting for TRIA, the anti-terrorism risk insurance plan. 
   My good friend stated that construction can go forward without it. After 9/11 you could not even build a hot dog stand. Nothing moved until we got the anti-terrorism risk insurance in place. 
   I am told by the businesses in New York and other large cities in our country that they cannot get insurance now. They get insurance up to the date that TRIA expires, and they are not given insurance unless there is agreement or a condition that TRIA will continue. 
   He argued that TRIA was not homeland security. I will say very strongly that part of our homeland security is our economic security, and a very important part of our economic security is having a Federal support system for terrorism risk insurance. 
   The TRIA bill was a top priority of the Financial Services Committee. It was one of the first bills reported out, and I thank Chairman Frank for his continued support for a long-term TRIA, including a reset provision to increase the availability of terrorism insurance for areas that have been targets of terror acts like my city of New York. 
   The reset language in this bill, though, treats equally everyone across this country. We are including in this bill absolutely everything that was in the Senate-passed bill. The only change is we come from the 15 years down to the 7 years of the Senate. But the other key provisions that were dropped, we are putting back in, such as the lower trigger level so that more insurers can be part of this program. This is very important. Group life insurance. Life insurance for fairness for travelers, and the very important reset mechanism for the anti-terrorism risk insurance. 
   We need this bill and we need it promptly to avoid interruptions in coverage and the disruptions that that will cause in our economy. 
   I would say that TRIA has created jobs and helped America's economy grow despite the continuing terrorist threat. I thank the chairman and this body on both sides for supporting it.  
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of this bill. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Frank for his continued strong support for a long term renewal of TRIA including the reset provisions to increase the availability of terrorism insurance for areas that have been targets of terror attacks like my city of New York. 
   I appreciate the chairman's insistence on having the House debate and vote on a bill that includes four key provisions from the original House-passed bill. 
   Most important of these, in my view, is the reset provision. To encourage companies to write insurance in an area that has been a target of terrorism, after a significant terrorist attack, that is, an attack causing over $1 billion in damages, the bill would lower both the deductible and the trigger for terrorism insurance policies in the targeted area, to rebuild market capacity and then gradually increase private sector obligations over time. 
   This reset mechanism applies equally for everyone across the country. For example, the lower deductible would apply to all the insurers that were affected by the significant terrorist attack, regardless of where the attack occurred. 
   Also, the bill lowers the ``trigger'' level--the size of an attack at which the Federal Government would provide aid to insurers--back to the $50 million in the original House bill. The TRIA extension enacted in 2005 set the limit at $50 million in 2006 and $100 million in 2007. The Senate bill provides a trigger of $100 million. A lower trigger will allow more insurers to participate in the program and thereby increase the availability of terrorism insurance, and will also address a serious concern of the small insurers who fear they will be driven out of business by terrorist attacks that cause less than $100 million in insured losses that would not trigger the protection provided by TRIA. 
   The bill includes the provision from the House bill putting group life insurance in TRIA. TRIA should cover not only buildings but also the people who work in them. Group life carriers face insolvency if a terrorist event affects a large group of people. It is important to the economic security of America's workers and their families that group life carriers remain solvent and capable of paying claims after a terrorist attack. 
   Finally, like the original House bill, the bill prohibits life insurance companies from denying or reducing coverage to an individual based on their foreign travel. 
   It is critical that these provisions be included in the bill we send back to the Senate. We need to send a strong message that these provision are important, and that this body will not be cowed by the White House's foolish threat to veto this legislation. 
   I could not more strongly disagree with the White House when they insist the program should be short term and temporary. That will exacerbate market disarray and harm our economy--exactly what the terrorists want.  
   The administration's continued opposition to this bill is another example of the stubborn wrongheadedness for which this White House has become renowned. 
   On a bipartisan basis, business leaders, law enforcement, and the American people strongly support a long term TRIA bill that protects our economy and our security. 
   Recognizing the significant benefits that TRIA has for our entire economy, the US Chamber of Commerce said, and I quote:  
   The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act has promoted long-term availability of terrorism risk insurance for catastrophic terror events and has provided a standard of stability for financial markets and recovery after such an attack. [TRIA] has created jobs and helped America's economy grow despite the continuing terrorist threats against the United  States. ..... It is essential that Congress not allow this vital law to expire.  
   There are few issues so important to our Nation's economy as a stable long term federal support system for terrorism risk insurance. 
   We need a new TRIA bill and we need it promptly, to avoid interruptions in coverage and the disruptions that will cause. 
   We all fervently hope there will be no more terrorist attacks on our soil. But we must recognize that insuring against that dreadful contingency is a fundamental part of making our country safer. It is a part of homeland security that we cannot afford to ignore. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will provide relief to over 100,000 of my constituents.  
   This week, the House will once again restate our commitment to fiscal responsibility and pass legislation to provide millions of middle-class families with tax cuts to grow our economy without increasing the national debt. 
   The AMT Relief Act contains must-pass provisions that will provide $50 billion in immediate tax relief for working families by preventing 23 million middle class families from paying higher taxes this April. 
   Without this legislation, these 23 million families will be subjected to the alternative minimum tax, including almost 111,000 of my constituents. 
   When the AMT was enacted, it was meant to ensure the wealthiest among us paid their fair share of a tax that was never designed to hit the pocketbooks of middle-class families. 
   While this is only a temporary fix, I want to be clear that I hope we can move forward in the near future to provide a long-term solution to this problem. 
   I am proud that Chairman Rangel and Speaker Pelosi have brought this fix to the floor today while still adhering to the pay-as-you-go promise this Democratic controlled Congress has promised the American people. 
   Their leadership have truly brought our country in a new direction. 
   On the other hand, President Bush has threatened to veto and Senate Republicans voted against the earlier House-passed AMT bill because it adhered to our pay-as-you-go promise. 
   The stubborn fiscal irresponsibility of President Bush and Senate Republicans has delayed getting middle-class tax relief approved in a timely fashion and resulted in the Senate passing AMT relief legislation that is not paid for--passing debt instead of prosperity onto our children and grandchildren. 
   We are trying every possible alternative to adhere to pay-as-you-go budget rules--reversing the years of failed Republican policies that have mortgaged our grandchildren's future with additional foreign-owned debt--giving the Senate one more chance to do the right thing. 
   While fixing the AMT is of outmost importance, we cannot afford to mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future to pay for this tax relief. 
   Our country is currently burdened with over $9 trillion of national debt, with each American's share at nearly $30,000. 
   We simply cannot afford to keep adding to this. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats in Congress are providing common sense tax relief for middle-class American families, and we are doing it in a fiscally responsible way. 
   I urge this bill's adoption.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, with Mother's Day and Father's Day behind us, it's time for us to practice what we preach. If we truly believe in the value of family, then we need to value the work that families do. 
   U.S. workers, unlike most workers worldwide, do not have the right to take paid time off to care for the birth of a new child. That is why the House should offer a model to the rest of the country by passing the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act when it comes to the floor today. This bill provides 4 weeks of paid time off for all Federal employees to care for a new child. 
   This landmark bill will be the first to recognize that parents need their earnings, even as they need time off, to care for their new child. 
   Congress's action on family values should more than match its rhetoric. We should be the role model for all employers. 
   According to a Harvard study, the U.S. ranks 169th in the world in terms of providing paid time off. We are tied with Swaziland. Tom Davis is bipartisan and has been a cosponsor for 10 years. Let's pass it unanimously in a bipartisan recognition of family values.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5781, FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his leadership on so many important issues and for supporting working families. This is the 21st century. Both the father and the mother have to work, and this is an important family friendly, family value legislation. 
   How many times have we heard the friends on the opposite side of the aisle talk about family values? Well, today we will have an opportunity to vote and do something to help families. Today we will take up my legislation, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. This bill will provide 4 weeks of paid leave to Federal employees when they have a new child or adopt a new child. 
   If we truly believe in the value of family, then we need to value the work that families do. This means that we need to stop asking parents to choose between a paycheck and caring for a new child. Unlike a generation ago, today both parents work outside the home, and both need time off from work when they have a new child, yet most do not have access to paid family leave. 
   By providing paid parental leave to Federal employees, H.R. 5781 establishes the Federal Government as a model employer. A recent study found that out of 173 countries, 169 countries offered guaranteed leave with income to women in connection with childbirth. This ties the United States with Swaziland and New Guinea in terms of what we are offering in paid leave for new families. 
   This landmark bill is the first to provide paid family leave for new parents. It signals our commitment to valuing our employees and their families. This bill is good for the Federal agencies, it is good for Federal employees, and it is cost effective. 
   The lack of paid family leave puts Federal agencies at a disadvantage when competing for the best and the brightest employees. Our Federal workforce is aging and many of our agencies are finding it difficult to recruit and retain younger workers.     
   Providing paid parental leave would encourage younger workers who may be considering having a family to stay with the Federal Government. 
   Paid parental leave is already offered by the largest and most profitable U.S. companies. My staff at the Joint Economic Committee found that the Federal Government lags far behind Fortune 100 companies in providing paid leave as part of their benefits package. Fortune 100 companies overwhelmingly offer new mothers paid leave lasting 6 to 8 weeks long. 
   Federal employees who become new parents have the option of using their accrued vacation time, some sick days only if they're sick or tapping into a leave bank. This may work for the lucky families who never get sick, never need a vacation and are happy to rely on the kindness of strangers, but for many this is a second-rate solution, since even the best prepared employees often face difficult choices when children need their care. 
   The only national policy that covers parental leave is the Family and Medical Leave Act which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave and job protection. The Family and Medical Leave Act is important, but because it is unpaid, many, especially low wage or younger workers with limited savings, cannot afford to use it. 
   H.R. 5781 is cost-effective. And the Congressional Budget Office reports that it is PAYGO compliant. 
   In testimony in support of this bill, Daniel Beard, Chief Administrative Officer of the U.S. House of Representatives noted: ``This approach saves money. Employee morale is always greater when an employer treats employees with dignity, especially in times of crisis.'' I could not agree more with him.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I know that many of you are scratching your heads and wondering how this bill can be PAYGO neutral. It is easy to explain. The $190 million is the amount that the agencies currently save on salaries when Federal employees who have a new child take their unpaid leave, as they are entitled to under the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   After we implement H.R. 5781, it will be up to the Federal agencies to implement this new benefit and whether they will ask for increased appropriations in the future. 
   But let's remember, right now Federal employees who have a child bear both the burden of going without pay during family and medical leave, as well as coping with their new family  expenses. This is an opportunity for us to put action behind our rhetoric on family values. 
   I urge strong bipartisan support. It is supported by TOM DAVIS on the other side of the aisle, the ranking member of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee which considered and reported out this bill. 
   And I thank Chairman Waxman and many others for their strong support.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my good friend and colleague for that generous introduction and for his strong leadership on this bill and in so many areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. I am proud to be the author of this bill and pleased that a Democratic majority has brought this bill to the floor. 
   I particularly want to thank Chairman Waxman for his extraordinary leadership on this and in so many ways, and also former chairman, Ranking Member Tom Davis, who has been a lead sponsor on this legislation since it was first introduced. I thank him deeply, and, of course, Subcommittee Chair Danny Davis. I am pleased to work every day with you on your committee, and George Miller, for their outstanding support of this bill. They are strong advocates for Federal employees, and I expect that with their leadership and support we will pass this bill today to help working families in the Federal Government. 
   This bill is very important to me because I very painfully remember when I was pregnant with my first child, I was terrified of being fired. I was working for the New York State legislature, and I called the personnel office to inquire about their parental leave policy. I was told, leave policy, there is none, women just leave. 
   I said, well, I intend to come back to work because I have to work. What is your leave policy? They said, we have none. Possibly you could apply for disability. I told her that the birth of a child is not a disability, it is a joyous event. 
   I would say to my dear friend and colleague on the opposite side of the aisle that having a child is not a perk, it is important, it is important to the lives of the parents, it is important to the lives of our country. We should turn our family values rhetoric into a reality of providing some support to working men and women in the Federal Government. 
   Balancing work and family is a challenge that most parents face and good workplace policy can go a long way towards helping them. We have come a long ways since I was told that women just leave, but not far enough. According to a report from the Joint Economic Committee, three-quarters, or 75 percent, of all Fortune 100 companies offer parental leave to new mothers with a median length of leave from 6 to 8 weeks. Now these are some of the most successful companies in the country. They should know a little bit about retaining workers. 
   We also reviewed House offices and Senate offices. Most House offices, 85 percent, provide paid leave. Senate offices, 95 percent of the Senate offices, provide paid leave. The Armed Forces, they provide it also. They are not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act but they recognize the importance of providing some paid time and leave for Federal workers and for their workers. 
   The Federal Government has not kept up with the changing times and needs to become competitive with the private sector. Employees are now entitled to have 12 weeks of un paid leave through the Family and Medical Leave Act. As we have heard time and time again many families cannot afford to take unpaid leave and are therefore forced to choose between their new child and their paycheck. No one should have to make that choice. 
   I would say that it's very difficult for new families. Not only does it cost roughly $12,000 to provide for a new child the first year, daycare is not available for newborns until they are 12 weeks old, so this puts tremendous pressure on families, where most parents have to work. 
   We have heard about Ozzie and Harriet, you know, Ozzie worked and Harriet was at home. Now 60 percent of married women work because they have to, and we should be providing them with some help. Not only will this legislation help these new families in the Federal Government, but it will also help the Federal Government with recruitment and retention. 
   Turnover is more expensive than providing paid leave. The average cost of turnover is about 20 percent of an employee's annual salary. Four weeks of paid leave is less than 8 percent of an employee's salary. This is an important piece of legislation to working men and women. 
   I would say that providing paid parental leave to Federal employees is a great first step toward providing this benefit to all working Americans, and it is a critical step towards helping our families. 
   I want to note that Senator Jim Webb and Senator John Warner, in a bipartisan effort, have introduced a companion bill in the Senate, and they have many cosponsors. The bill has a great deal of support because it is the right thing to do and will demonstrate our commitment to working families. 
   To those who say we cannot afford to do it, I say we can't afford not to do it.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I disagree with my distinguished colleague on the other side of the aisle. I have heard heartbreaking stories from real Federal workers who would strongly disagree with you. I will give one example from a woman who had to go back to work with an open wound due to a C-section while giving birth. And it is not possible to use your paid sick leave. Sick leave is for when you're sick. And by our guidelines, you can use it only when you are incapacitated, when you're in the hospital, or bedridden. And it takes a long time to accrue these. 
   Now, in terms of costs, the score from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that in 2010, the first full year that this could be implemented, it will cost roughly $190 million. To put this in perspective, this is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the Federal payroll. The cost estimate predicts that approximately 17,000 women and 23,000 men who have worked for the Federal Government for at least a year and will have a child in the course of a year. 
   They assumed that mothers will take advantage of this benefit 100 percent of the time, and men roughly 50 percent of the time. This amounts to approximately 1 percent of the Federal workforce using this benefit at a given year. 
   There are also potential cost savings that can't be estimated by CBO. Providing this benefit will likely improve retention rates for Federal employees. Research shows that women who have access to paid leave, not just unpaid leave, are more likely to return to their jobs after having a child; and access to family leave can also improve productivity and morale. For example, in my office, I offer 12 weeks of paid parental leave to new parents on my staff. I have two current employees  who have used my leave policy twice. Both have been with my office for many years, and I attribute the longevity of their employment to my family leave benefit. 
   Additionally, in my office we've been able to offer this benefit at no additional cost to taxpayers.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I repeat, it has not cost the taxpayer one cent. We have not added additional staff but rather redistributed the work among the rest of the staff. While it does create more work for others, it has also given junior staff members opportunities to assume more responsibility, and it was a relatively smooth transition. 
   The costs of this bill are relatively small compared to the positive effect that it will have on the lives of working families in the Federal Government. How many times have we heard the words ``family values'' from the other side of the aisle? It is time to turn family values into a reality in the lives of the workforce, and this is a way that we can help Federal workers, the largest employer in the United States, and make this important event in one's life, becoming a parent, really a joyous one in which they do not have to be stressed. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (RECOGNIZING THE 186TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this legislation, H. Res. 228, and cochair and cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, I rise today to celebrate the 186th anniversary of Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire. 
   Against incredibly difficult odds, the Greeks defeated one of the most powerful empires in history to gain their independence. 
   Following 400 years of Ottoman rule, in March 1821, Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the traditional Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting his countrymen to rise up against the Ottoman Empire. 
   The bishop timed this act of revolution to coincide with the Greek Orthodox holiday celebrating the archangel Gabriel's announcement that the Virgin Mary was pregnant with the divine child. 
   Bishop Germanos' message to his people was clear, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece. The following year, the Treaty of Constantinople established full independence of Greece. 
   As we celebrate Greek Independence Day, we should reflect upon the strong ties between Greece and the United States and the strong commitment to democracy shared by our two countries. 
   The Greeks of 1821 fought for independence from the Ottoman Empire while drawing inspiration from the ideals and institutions of the United States. 
   During their war of independence, the Greeks also received support from many Americans, including Presidents James Madison and James Monroe and Representatives Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, each of whom gave speeches and made resolutions and other statements in Congress in support of the Greek revolutionaries. 
   Just as our defeat of the British Army was remarkable, so too was the Greek triumph over the Ottoman Army, a momentous achievement in world history. 
   New York City is home to the largest Hellenic population outside of Greece and Cyprus. Western Queens, which I have the honor of representing, is often called Little Athens because of the large Hellenic population in its neighborhoods. 
   New Yorkers celebrate Greek Independence Day with a parade on Fifth Avenue, along with many cultural events, private meetings and celebrations. These events, hosted by the Federation of Hellenic Societies and other Hellenic and Philhellenic organizations and friends, remind us of the Hellenic American community's many, many contributions to our Nation's history and culture. 
   Relations between the United States and Greece remain strong with a shared commitment to ensuring stability in southeastern Europe. 
   I hope permanent solutions can be found for ending the division of Cyprus and finding a mutually agreed upon name for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
   Additionally, I strongly support the inclusion of Greece in the Visa Waiver Program. Last month, along with Representatives SPACE and BILIRAKIS and 18 of our House colleagues, we sent letters to Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff urging them to extend the Visa Waiver Program to Greece. Greece is the only member of the original 15 European Union nations not to belong to the Visa Waiver Program. 
   Greece has met the criteria for the program, including a less than 3 percent refusal rate of U.S. nonimmigrant visa applicants and biometric passports. I hope that they will soon be included in the program, and I ask my colleagues and the Nation to join me in celebrating Greek's independence today. 
   Additionally, it is my sincere pleasure to pay tribute to the New York Hellenic American community for its many, many contributions to our city and Nation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (OFFSHORE DRILLING AND GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President announced that he is lifting the executive order that prevents Big Oil from drilling off of the treasured coastline of America. 
   What will this do to lower gas prices any time soon? Nothing. And nothing is exactly what the administration has been doing for the past 7 years as gas prices have nearly tripled. 
   By contrast, Democrats in Congress have been working on bringing down prices at the pump. We passed the first fuel efficiency standards in 32 years, and are supporting the movement to alternative fuels. 
   We want to help families now by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forcing big oil companies to start drilling on the 311 acres that are open for development now, or the 68 million acres that are under lease now for development. 
   Mr. Speaker, if domestic drilling can bring relief to American families, what are the big oil companies waiting for? Drill on those 311 acres and those 68 million acres under lease.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today we observe Equal Pay Day, the day that indicates just how far into each year a woman must work to earn as much as a man earned in the previous year. 
   Women are more highly educated and productive than ever, yet these gains have not yet translated into equal pay across the board. A Government Accountability Office study that JOHN DINGELL and I sponsored showed that when occupation, marital status, job tenure, industry and race are accounted for, women still earn eighty cents for every dollar men earn. 
   This wage gap extends across all income levels and occupations, and it's even wider for minority women. There is no excuse for this gap between men and women. Both men and women must feed their families and pay their rent. Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and close the gender wage gap for good.

His walk from New York to California, called A Journey for 9/11, began just after the sixth anniversary of that tragic day. This week his walk continues through Tennessee as he approaches his 100th mile. 
   George is an inspiration and a true all-star. And as he walks, this Congress is responding to the need, providing $109 million for treatment in this budget. But we need to pass the 9/11 Health Act to help all those suffering from 9/11 injuries. It is the least a grateful nation can do.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (ALICE PAUL WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong to support of H.R. 406, which awards a Congressional Gold Medal to Alice Paul. 
   Every American woman is indebted to Alice Paul for her lifelong dedication to women's suffrage. I am living proof of the advancements she has made for women. I am personally gratified that Congress is recognizing Alice Paul's contribution to American history. Alice Paul was the first cousin to my husband's grandmother. In fact, I named my oldest daughter after her. 
   Alice Paul passionately devoted her entire life to the advancement of women's rights. She was an extraordinary leader, ingenious fundraiser, and a brilliant politician. Wholeheartedly focused on suffrage, she lived in a cold room so she would not be tempted to sit up late and read novels. 
   Alice Paul truly revolutionized the suffragist movement. In 1913, Alice Paul and fellow suffragist Lucy Burns organized an impressive suffrage parade on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. In 1916, Paul founded the National Women's Party with the guiding philosophy of ``holding the party in power responsible.'' Paul adamantly believed that women should never expect to be given the vote, but that they must take it through their own accord. 
   Under Paul's leadership, the National Women's Party was the first political organization in the United States to peacefully picket the White House. This political strategy is still widely used today. Originally the White House protests were tolerated by President Wilson. But as the women persistently picketed during the war, suffragist protestors were attacked by angry mobs and frequently arrested. 
   The suffragist prisoners demanded to be treated as political prisoners and staged hunger strikes. Their demands were met with brutality as suffragists, including older women, were beaten, pushed and thrown into cold, unsanitary, rat-infested cells. Women were even force-fed against their will. Thanks to the countless sacrifices made by suffrage activists, American women were finally granted the right to vote in 1920. 
   Yet, Alice Paul firmly believed that true fulfillment of women's rights was only advanced, not completely satisfied, by the achievement of suffrage. Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment for the United States Constitution in 1923. She devoted the rest of her life to this goal of constitutional protection for women's equality and today, feminists continue this pursuit. I have proudly continued her legacy by introducing the ERA every Congress since 1997. 
   Alice Paul's lifelong efforts achieved great strides not only for American women, but for all women of the world. She founded the World Woman's Party in 1938. Paul and the World Woman's Party successfully fought for the inclusion of gender equality into the United Nations Charter. Their efforts also led to the establishment of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This Commission continues to be a principal global policy-making body for women's advancement. 
   Let us finally grant Alice Paul her rightful place in history. She is most deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Her legacy opened the door for women's full participation in society and for that, we are forever grateful.

But certainly individuals going on trips should know the track records of cruise lines, and know the steps they have taken to improve safety. The absolute most important part of a vacation is to make sure you have a safe, enjoyable time. 
   This is a commonsense amendment, and it will provide the public with valuable information before booking their trips, as well as give an indication of where there are challenges in the industry and improvements that have taken place. I urge an ``aye'' vote.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, today belongs to the family members of the attacks of September 11 who have worked tirelessly to see these recommendations enacted. They spent today in Congress in meetings in support of this legislation. 
   The 9/11 Commission gave us a blueprint for better security which was not meant to be on a shelf gathering dust. With this legislation, Congress accomplishes more for security in less than a week than it previously could accomplish in more than 2 years. 
   Homeland security is a high priority of the first 100 hours agenda, and it includes many important and commonsense provisions. It requires Homeland Security grants to be based on risk, not politics. And the radios that did not work on 9/11 still do not work, and they did not work at Katrina. It establishes a grant program specifically for communications equipment for first responders. 
   It establishes an independent privacy and civil liberties board with subpoena power, and it includes the prevention and helps to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The bill expands the U.S. diplomatic outreach in the Middle East. 
   In short, the bill will make our citizens and our country safer. It is an important bill, and the 9/11 families thank the leadership of this Congress. The responders thank the leadership of this Congress. And I am deeply grateful that H.R. 1 is among the first bills in the first Democratic Congress to pass. It will make us safer in this country. I congratulate the new leadership on their hard work at making this happen.

   The 9/11 Commission report identified the failure in the intelligence system of this country as a major cause of 9/11. They called for many reforms, some of which we have implemented. And as co-chair of the 9/11 Commission Caucus, I am extremely pleased today with the formation of this new Select Intelligence Oversight panel, which mirrors the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. It is supported by many of the members of the 9/11 Commission. It is supported by the 9/11 families that have tracked the provisions to make this country safer probably closer and harder than Members of this Congress, and they are in the gallery today. And this new oversight panel will strengthen the oversight process by combining the perspectives and expertise of both the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees and the insights of the authorizers likewise. And this new panel, we can be assured that these experts from both of these areas will be included in the oversight and funding decisions for our intelligence community. 
   I congratulate the leadership of this Congress, the new Democratic leadership, Speaker Pelosi and Chairman OBEY, for including in the first 100 hours this major reform, that they have repeatedly said in all of their hearings and they continue to speak out on it, they gave this Congress an ``F'' in intelligence oversight. Today we are getting an ``A'' by creating a committee with experts to oversee it. And with a focus on the security and the intelligence, it will make this country safer. I applaud our leadership, the new Democratic leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker and Chairman FRANK, on behalf of New York City, which I represent, I am pleased that the House is considering the Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act.  
   I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of this legislation in every session since it was first introduced in the 107th Congress. 
   As you know, the primary purpose of the bill is to increase the flexibility of the Housing and Urban Development Department's Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) and to make the program available to more local Governments. 
   The legislation eliminates the requirement that communities applying for BEDI grants must pledge their Community Block Development Grant (CBDG) funding as security for the loan--a rule that puts local Governments between a rock and a hard place. 
   Since its inception, the larger brownfields program has proven an effective Government response to a serious environmental problem, and it is important that we maximize its use. 
   Brownfields are abandoned, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where further redevelopment is impeded by environmental contamination. They spot our country from coast to coast, especially in areas with high or formerly high levels of industrial activity, such as older urban areas. New York City, including my district, is full of them. 
   These locations have potential for economic development but are held back by the environmental problems created by former or current users. The program has successfully used a variety of financial and technical assistance to restore these sites which would otherwise be doomed to further decay. 
   I am very pleased to support this legislation and thank Representative Gary Miller for introducing it again this year and Chairman Barney Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their leadership on this bipartisan issue.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, a new report by the Joint Economic Committee shows 1 million more children a year may need public health insurance due to the worsening economic conditions, even apart from the growing trend in coverage in our Nation.

   This is a perfect storm that can be avoided, if Congress votes today to override the President's veto of legislation that would bring health care to 10 million children in need. 
   Over the next 5 years, our bill would preserve coverage for more than 6 million children currently covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program and extend coverage to nearly 4 million children who are currently uninsured. 
   I urge my colleagues today to vote to override the President's veto of children's health insurance.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my colleague from the Empire State, the Great State of New York, for yielding to me, and for his leadership on the Rules Committee and in so many other areas in our Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule for H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act. I would like to thank the Rules Committee Chairwoman, LOUISE SLAUGHTER, for crafting this rule, and I would like to thank her for making in order 18 amendments, and one amendment that I will offer later on reforms for prepayment penalties on subprime loans. 
   I congratulate Chairman Frank for his stewardship on this difficult legislation, and I thank my colleagues, Congressman Watt and Congressman Miller from the Great State of North Carolina, which passed antipredatory lending in their State legislature that has been referenced many times in committee meetings and hearings. 
   I also thank the staff on the Democratic and Republican side that have worked very, very hard, our individual staffs and staffs of the committee, on facing this difficult challenge. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this legislation has been done in a fair, open, and bipartisan process. During the committee markup last week, we entertained numerous amendments and consistently worked with the ranking member and the other Republicans on the committee. The result of all the chairman's hard work on this bill was demonstrated when this bill passed the committee on a bipartisan vote of 45-19. 
   The bill we are considering today is carefully crafted legislation that was developed after our committee carefully considered the testimony and advice of many experts and witnesses.     
   I know the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, which I chair, held a series of hearings looking into what can and should be done. I am happy to see a number of suggestions recommended by witnesses reflected in this legislation. 
   This was no easy task. As each and every one of us knows, the mortgage market is incredibly complex and any new proposal to clamp down on abusive practices must be done in a way that does not disrupt what is working correctly. I am proud to say that I believe this legislation has struck that delicate balance. The rule protects this legislation from amendments that may disrupt that balance, yet fairly allows for amendments that could enhance this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this fair rule and for the underlying legislation. 
   Any legislation on this issue must strike a very careful balance that provides enhanced consumer protections without unnecessarily limiting the availability of loans to creditworthy borrowers. This bill contains a number of provisions that strengthen underwriting standards and provide additional protections for consumers while not unduly constraining sound lending and the secondary market. These include setting a clear standard that mortgages should be made based on a borrower's ability to repay, which is absolute common sense; setting up a system for licensing nationally; setting professional standards for mortgage brokers and an appropriate system of registration for loan officers; and setting a reasonable limits on assignee liability to ensure that investors will want to provide liquidity for housing finance. 
   This bill, I think, is a very strong one. It adds accountability and transparency to the system. It builds investor confidence in the system; and without that confidence, we will continue to face a growing market crisis. 
   We heard in our hearings from 2 to 5 million people, depending on the economists who were testifying, may lose their homes. That is more than lost their homes during the Great Depression. So the committee focused in two areas: first, on helping people stay in their homes with various measures that we passed, and this legislation going forward will prevent the types of abuses and really the turmoil in the market that was not in place because there were not oversight transparency and safeguards. 
   I congratulate Chairman Frank on a very difficult balancing act, and I believe the legislation before us will not only help individuals stay in their homes, prevent abuses in the future, but will help the liquidity, stability, and creditworthiness of our entire economy. I no longer call it a subprime crisis; it's a credit crisis. We need to address it. This is tremendously important. We must pass this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   This amendment, which I am offering with my good friend and colleague from New Jersey, ALBIO SIRES, addresses prepayment penalties and prime loans. This is a well-balanced amendment that has gained the support both of consumer groups and industry. 
   Prepayment penalties are designed to deter borrowers from refinancing, or just paying off their loans. This seems unfair; why should anyone be penalized for paying off their loans? Why should borrowers not be able to take advantage of a better offer if it becomes available? Isn't that how the free market system is supposed to work? 
   The underlying bill prohibits prepayment penalties on subprime loans and requires that prepayment penalties on prime loans expire 3 months before a loan resets. But I think we need to offer all borrowers, including prime borrowers, an alternative to loans with prepayment penalties. At the most, prepayment penalties should last 3 years, the time needed for lenders to recover their investment. 
   Mortgage lenders argue that prepayment penalties enable them to offer loans at lower interest rates because they are assured of income for a period of time. Our amendment just requires them to offer prime borrowers an informed choice. If a lender offers a borrower a loan with a prepayment penalty, they also have to offer that borrower a loan with no prepayment penalty. 
   Also, our amendment would limit the period of prepayment penalties to 3 years and limit the amount of the penalty to 3 percent of the outstanding balance in the first year, 2 percent in the second, and 1 percent in the third. This standard has already been adopted in many States and is often referred to as the ``California standard.'' It represents what reputable lenders consider best practices. Prepayment penalties beyond 3 years are simply unjustified by any market need. 
   This is a balanced amendment that gives lenders adequate security and the option to offer prime loans with prepayment penalties, but also gives prime borrowers a choice to avoid prepayment penalties if they so wish. It is a sensible and necessary step to improved disclosure and improved choice. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support and thank Congressmembers Klein and Mahoney for their leadership. 
   I have long held the belief that we need solutions to the growing crisis of availability and affordability of homeowner insurance. That is why I was the sponsor of the National Catastrophe Insurance Act in previous congresses, which would have established a Federal reinsurance plan following a disaster with more than $50 billion in insured losses. 
   Right now we are seeing the consequences of not having these products available. In the wake of a series of devastating hurricanes, large swaths of our country are seeing insurance companies either leaving the market or premiums that are simply too high for homeowners to afford. The legislation before us focuses on stabilizing the catastrophic insurance market by expanding private insurance capacity to cover natural disasters and by helping States better manage risk. This legislation allows States to participate in the plan by allowing their State-sponsored insurance funds to voluntarily pool their catastrophic risk with one another. 
   The private market, and not taxpayers, will take on the risk through the purchasing of catastrophic bonds and reinsurance contracts. Just as I support other efforts such as TRIA to provide certainty after catastrophic events, I believe it is prudent to put in place a system that insures risk. This allows affected communities and our economy as a whole to respond to each and every disaster in a clear and rational manner while protecting the residents, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank him for his leadership on this important legislation and for the city of New York in general. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that will help preserve affordable housing units. I commend my colleagues from Brooklyn, Congressman Towns and Congresswoman Vel&#225;zquez, for their leadership in drafting this legislation, and I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Financial Services, especially Congresswoman Waters who is Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, and also Chairman Frank for bringing this important bill to the floor today.     
   When passed, this legislation would authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, upon the request of the owner of a multi-family housing project, to convert their contract to a section 8, project-based rental assistance contract. This would have an immediate impact on Starrett City, the Starrett City housing complex in Brooklyn, New York, which is currently serving 14,000 New Yorkers in affordable housing units. 
   Starrett City is the largest affordable housing complex in our country, and this legislation is innovative, it is helpful, it is collaborative, and it is bipartisan. And I thank my colleague, Mr. Castle, for his leadership on the other side of the aisle. 
   Starrett City was opened in 1974, and recently there have been efforts to sell the complex and potentially leave these affordable housing units and have them sold and re-priced to reflect the current market value. By selling these units, you would put at risk affordable housing for all of the 14,000 residents that are living there. It would endanger their ability to continue as residents living in Starrett City, and I would say, I don't know where they would go. In New York City there is such a housing crisis and we have no affordable housing left. This legislation would help preserve these affordable units for at least the next 20 years. 
   All of us know that we are facing foreclosures across this country. We are talking about programs to have grants, to have negotiations, to have support, to keep people in their homes. We have before us today creative legislation that the owner supports, that the city supports, and hopefully this Congress supports, that could save 14,000 homes for New Yorkers and keep them in affordable housing. 
   I congratulate my colleague, Mr. Towns, and everyone else who has worked so hard to make this happen. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this tremendously important legislation that will keep people in their homes, affordable homes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY08 Consolidated Appropriations Legislation. Although this bill does not accomplish everything that we had wanted for the next fiscal year, the bill will provide critical funding to many programs that for too long have been underfunded. 
   Among many other important provisions, this legislation will provide $607 million above the President's request for medical research of diseases including Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes. It will make investments in education including K through 12, Pell Grants, and vocational education. It will help make communities across the country safer by providing $1.2 billion above the President's request for state and local law enforcement. Lastly, it will provide critical homeland security funding at $1.8 billion above the President's request. 
   I want to note several other items in this bill that are of particular interest to me and many of my constituents. 
   The bill provides $108 million for the health needs of World Trade Center responders, residents, students, and others exposed to the toxins of Ground Zero, to be administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The legislation also requests that the Administration prepare a plan for a comprehensive program for health screenings, analysis, and medical treatment for the entire exposed community. I want to sincerely thank Chairman Obey and his incredibly able staff for their continued dedication to the heroes of 9/11. 
   I commend the Appropriations Committee for including enough baseline funding to continue the invaluable Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) in FY 2008, despite the Bush Administration's initial desire to eliminate the survey. The SIPP provides the most comprehensive data on the economic well-being of American families, and I am glad that the Committee understood its importance. 
   The legislation before us will provide $75 million to help Afghan women and girls including funding for the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission which does essential work in Afghanistan to combat human rights abuses. Additionally, the bill provides more than $147,000,000 for processing the backlog of DNA evidence kits as provided by the Debbie Smith Act, legislation I first introduced in 2001. 
   I want to thank Chairman Obey and the Appropriations Committee for its work under very difficult conditions, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. 
   This bill will end the double-whammy of paying taxes on the lost value of their homes by providing a permanent exclusion from gross income of discharged home mortgage debt. 
   We are passing this legislation at a time when anxiety over the state of the economy remains high and concerns mount that the subprime mortgage meltdown will infect the rest of the economy. 
   Last month, RealtyTrac released the latest bad news that foreclosures reported in August increased 36 percent since July and 115 percent since this time last year. 
   Expectations are that the next 18 months will be even worse, as many subprime loans reset to higher rates. We have real concerns that this subprime crisis will cause 2.2 million people to lose their homes. 
   The credit crunch, the worsening housing slump, market volatility, and weak consumer confidence point to a gathering storm that could drag down the economy, possibly taking thousands of American jobs with it. 
   In the face of this gathering storm, Democrats in Congress are working to help families stay in their home and are working to prevent another crisis. The House has passed FHA and GSE reform bills. We are working on a predatory lending bill. 
   We are working with regulators to advocate forbearance and with servicers to engage in workouts for strapped borrowers. 
   We recognize this crisis in homeownership and we are doing everything we can to respond in a forceful and responsible way. 
   Again, I support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on so many important issues before this body, including the Debbie Smith Act, which I rise today in strong support of, H.R. 5057, the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act that I introduced to ensure that the nationwide backlog of DNA evidence is processed. 
   I want to thank the bill's supporters in the Senate, especially Senators BIDEN, LEAHY, KYL and SPECTER, for their assistance in getting this legislation through the Senate and back to the House before we adjourn. 
   I also want to commend Chairman Conyers for his leadership, Ranking Member Smith, Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Gohmert, along with ANTHONY WEINER and so many of my colleagues for their support and commitment to this issue. 
   Advocates have called the Debbie Smith Act one of the most important anti-crime bills that has ever passed Congress and one of the most important anti-violence against women and anti-rape pieces of legislation ever. 
   I first introduced the grant program in 2001 after a rape victim whose attacker was later identified through DNA analysis testified before a hearing in Congress. The long, bipartisan effort to pass the original legislation was made into a Lifetime movie entitled ``A Life Interrupted: The Debbie Smith Story.'' I thank Lifetime and Oprah for having championed the passage of this important legislation. 
   I have been working on this issue since 2001, when I organized a hearing in the Government Reform and Oversight Committee to examine the use of DNA to both convict and to exonerate. We reached out to many victims to testify. Only one would come before Congress, Debbie Smith.     
   She told her horrifying story, how an intruder broke into her suburban home in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1989 and raped her repeatedly in nearby woods while her police officer husband slept upstairs. He rushed her to the police station. DNA was taken, but in many ways her life was destroyed, as she believed he would come back as he said he would and kill her if she had told anybody what happened. 
   Six years later, after an assailant was charged with her rape, because DNA processing techniques had produced a cold hit with a State prisoner's DNA sample, that match gave Debbie her first moment of closure and security. Since then, Debbie and her husband, Robert, have lobbied Congress, traveled the country and started a not-for-profit to help victims of rape. 
   It was unconscionable that hundreds of thousands of rape kits with DNA evidence already collected were gathering dust in police stations and crime labs all over this country, and it is still unconscionable that according to the U.S. Department of Justice, there are over 221,000 untested rape kits on shelves and evidence cabinets in States across our country. 
   It was for Debbie and rape survivors like her that in 2001 I authored the Debbie Smith Act to provide Federal funding to process the backlog of DNA evidence. The bill helped standardize the evidence collection of kits for sexual assaults, making it easier to enter the information into State and national databases. 
   It also helped forensic labs process the data evidence and compare the DNA samples with those taken from criminals. It funded the SANE nurse program that taught them how to process and maintain the information and to go into court to help the police with convictions. The law also allows law enforcement greater leeway to indict John Doe or an unnamed individual using their DNA profile. 
   The Justice for All Act accomplished several critical objectives, including authorizing the necessary funding, $151 million in each fiscal year from 2005 through 2009, to process the backlog of DNA evidence through the creation of the State grant program. 
   Since 2004, millions of dollars in funding have been appropriated to States across our country to attack this backlog grant program. Each unprocessed kit represents an innocent life like Debbie Smith, and a rapist who may commit multiple rapes before he is caught. 
   The FBI has characterized rape as the worst crime, preceded only by murder in terms of the destruction to one's life. They have said that a rapist, a sick person, will attack seven times. So at least, if you process these kits, you can put people in jail and prevent innocent victims from having the horror in their lives that Debbie experienced. 
   The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act extends the program through 2014 and also reauthorizes programs for training, education and sexual assault forensic exam grants. 
   DNA is remarkable evidence. It doesn't forget, it can't be confused, it is not intimidated, and it does not lie.  While an eyewitness can easily get mixed up about height, weight, hair color, DNA never changes its story. 
   Debbie's bravery and dedication and working with me and others to pass the Debbie Smith Act, which was a very difficult thing to accomplish, has already made a tremendous impact on our justice system. 
   I also want to acknowledge the RAINN program for its steadfast support of the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act and for its efforts on behalf of sexual assault victims and survivors. Tragically, only 6 percent of rapists will ever spend any time in jail. Congress must continue to support programs like the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program and help to put to rapists in prison, reduce the violence against women and solve other violent crimes. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in important bipartisan, hopefully unanimous support for this reauthorization.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2268, a bill introduced by the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) to create a commemorative coin honoring the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day. The 297 bipartisan cosponsors of this bill made clear that the Congress strongly supports recognizing the importance of Mother's Day in this way, and I am delighted to add my voice to this chorus. 
   Mother's Day was first proclaimed in 1908 by the Matthews Methodist Episcopal Church of Grafton, West Virginia, in honor of one mother, Anna Reeves Jarvis. 
   Congress designated the second Sunday in May to be observed as Mother's Day, and it was recognized as a national day to honor all mothers by President Woodrow Wilson on May 9, 1914. 
   The bill calls for a silver dollar to be minted in 2014 with a design commemorating President Wilson's proclamation. The $10 surcharge proceeds from their sale is to go to the Susan G. Komen Foundation, a household word and organization in combating breast cancer, and to the National Osteoporosis Foundation for research purposes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring Mother's Day and our Nation's mothers, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank my good friend and colleague from the great State of New York for his hard work on this and so many endeavors. And I rise today, as the cochair and cofounder on the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, in strong support of S. 254, to award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to Constantino Brumidi. 
   I'm so pleased to join 307 of my colleagues here in this legislative body. We were led so well by our colleague and good friend, Representative Pascrell. And we acknowledge the hard work of Congressman Pascrell and also the Hellenic Caucus and the Italian-American Caucus in getting the necessary cosponsors. 
   Brumidi was the son of a Greek father and an Italian mother. He fled Rome and immigrated to the United States in 1852. From 1868 to 1879, he was a resident in my congressional district of New York City. And while he was there, he painted 43 murals at St. Stephen's Church, which is in my district, and scholars come from around the world to study his work there, and here in the Capitol. 
   He is most famous, however, for his artistic achievement here in our great Capitol. ``The Apotheosis of George Washington'' on the dome in the Rotunda is one of the highlights of his brilliant work. He was called the Michelangelo of the Capitol. 
   He worked flat on his back on wooden scaffolding through the intense summer temperatures, and he created masterpieces throughout our Capitol. His artwork can be found in the Chamber, the House of Representatives Chamber, several committee rooms, the President's Room, the Senate Reception Room, and truly throughout the corridors of our Capitol. I am thrilled that we are recognizing such an outstanding artist and an important contributor to the history of art and the history of our Nation. 
   The Capitol building is special because of its beautiful architecture and priceless artistic treasures. Without Brumidi's influence, tours of the Capitol simply would not be certainly as beautiful or interesting to Americans. He is truly deserving of the honor we are bestowing upon him. Like many immigrants, he has brought many treasures to our country. 
   I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their important work in bringing this legislation to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, it is time that the U.S. ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW. 
   The treaty has been in force since 1981 and has been ratified by 185 countries; 185 countries cannot be wrong, and they include such countries as Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The U.S. stands out as the only Western country that has not ratified the treaty and, in doing so, keeps company with Iran, Sudan, and Somalia. 
   Women continue to be subjected to severe human rights violations simply because of their gender. Women in many parts of the world are unable to receive a basic education, earn a living, own or inherent property, or protect themselves against HIV/AIDS. Violence against women continues to be a terrible problem in all corners of the globe. 
   In the Mexican cities of Juarez and Chihuahua, over 400 women have been killed since 1993. In Guatemala over 2,500 women and girls have been murdered since 2001. 
   Women are still stoned to death and killed by members of their family in the name of honor. In 2002 at least 270 women were murdered in ``honor killings'' in the Punjab Province of Pakistan alone. 
   Domestic violence continues to hurt and kill women at alarming rates. In Russia 70 percent of married women have been hurt in one form or another of violence from their husbands. 
   CEDAW is an important tool in combating discrimination and human rights abuses against women around the world. It seeks to ensure that  women have equal access to education, public health, credit, property rights, as well as prevent violence against women. There have been numerous positive changes because of the convention, such as the implementation of equality legislation, the eradication of harmful practices such as sex slavery, and changes in inheritance laws. But there is clearly a great deal more to do. 
   As one of the most powerful nations in the world, the U.S. must be the leader in the fight against these violations of women's human rights. Our refusal to ratify the treaty sends the message that CEDAW is not important and does not need to be enforced. There is no valid reason why the U.S. should not ratify CEDAW. 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has voted twice to send the convention to the full Senate for ratification, first in 1994 and then again in 2002; but it has never been voted on by that body.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2316, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, and H.R. 2317, the Lobbying Transparency Act. 
   As the Jack Abramoff scandal made abundantly clear, the way that business has been conducted in Washington during the past few years needs to change. Congress already has taken important steps to reduce the influence of lobbyists, and the legislation that we are considering today will implement additional necessary reforms. These reforms include closing the revolving door between the legislative branch and post-employment lobbying, increased reporting requirements, including for bundled campaign contributions, and greater public access to lobbying reports and disclosure information. 
   The issue of openness in government is critical to our democracy. The American people should have faith that their representatives in Congress are responding to their needs and not acting in the interests of those trying to buy influence. 
   I also want to commend Chairman Conyers and the Judiciary Committee for including language in the bill to clarify that H.R. 2316 does not infringe upon the first amendment or prohibit any activities currently protected by the free speech, free exercise, or free association clauses.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Democratic National Summit on America's Children underscored the need to keep critical investments in preschool education for children today so that society does not pay a higher price later. A new Joint Economic Committee report shows that investing in high quality education is a cost-effective way of improving the life circumstances of children, while also increasing the U.S. economic growth over the long term by as much as 3.5 percent. 
   Another report details the provisions in Federal and State tax codes that are available to help families with children. The credits offered by my home State of New York are among the most generous. Both reports are available on the JEC website.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering funding legislation for the war in Iraq which unfortunately does not include the timelines for bringing the troops home that I and many of my colleagues have supported previously. While I strongly believe that we must provide the troops with the resources that they need to do their jobs, I cannot support an amendment that would leave them in Iraq indefinitely. 
   The intent of the benchmarks included in this amendment seems to be to send an important signal to the Iraqi government that it must make progress on the political, economic, and security fronts. I know that we all want to see that happen, but it is up to those of us in Congress who are committed to ending this war to ensure that the administration and the Iraqi government realize that we, and the American people, will not accept any more blank checks or false promises. 
   I do intend to support the amendment that will be offered to provide more than $20 billion for several key domestic items that have been part of the Democratic Majority's agenda. This amendment includes $1.8 billion for veterans' health care as well as funding for military health care, children's health care, and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. I am very pleased that this amendment includes the minimum wage increase that millions of hard-working Americans have been waiting on for a decade. I also want to commend Chairman Obey and the Appropriations Committee for including $50 million for Ground Zero workers and responders who risked their lives and are now suffering devastating health effects because of their brave service following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we will provide long overdue relief to those Americans who need it. 
   I am pleased to note that the rule, which I supported, that provided for consideration of these amendments ensures that before any further supplemental appropriations bills to fund the war can be considered, a vote must occur on legislation to redeploy U.S. troops from Iraq. 
   I am disappointed that the bill that will be sent to the President does not set out a clear path to end the war in Iraq. However, I and my colleagues who agree on this issue will continue to work for what the American people overwhelmingly voted for in November: a new direction, both in Iraq and at home.

Unemployment and poverty rates are higher. Our debt is staggering. Our trade deficit is the highest in history. 
   During the previous Democratic administration, the Dow Jones Industrials rose 328 percent over an 8-year period.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and chairing this important subcommittee and her hard work on this bill, along with Chairman Frank, and I rise in very strong support of the revitalization, reauthorization of an important program, HOPE VI. 
   This legislation will increase the annual authorization from $100 million to $800 million, and it is really a funding housing crisis, affordable housing crisis in our Nation. This funding and this program is desperately needed. 
   In New York City alone, over tens of thousands of people are on the waiting list for public housing. This bill requires that all public housing units proposed for demolition be replaced on a one-for-one basis and that any units demolished will be replaced within 36 months. This is tremendously important because people in public housing have no other place to go. 
   It adds additional tenant protections by requiring public housing agencies to monitor and track all households affected by the HOPE VI revitalization program, as well as develop a relocation plan that provides comparable housing for all relocated residents. 
   In an effort to be better stewards of our environment, this bill requires all replacement housing and other structures part of the HOPE VI development to be built in accordance with flexible green building standards, and it's appropriate for the government to have high environmental standards. It will be more energy efficient in the future and, in the long run, will save taxpayers dollars. 
   This bill continues a really important program that revitalizes severely distressed public housing and transforms them into safe, livable communities. And since its creation, it has provided over 560 grants, and Congress has appropriated over $6.6 billion in funding. 
   It has helped public housing authorities create relationships with the private sector and open up opportunities to bring partnerships that bring in much-needed resources into struggling communities. 
   For example, by 2004, 92 public housing authorities have used $313 million capital funds to leverage over $1 billion in private investment. These funds have been used to modernize and redevelop public housing. 
   With the crisis in safe, affordable housing we are seeing in our country, it is my hope that with our reauthorization of this important legislation we can continue the successes of this program. 
   I really urge my colleagues to support this program that is vitally needed.

Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pence amendment, which would deny Federal funding to one of the most important family planning and women's health organizations in the country. Current law prohibits using Title X funds to provide abortion services. Planned Parenthood has not violated this law. In fact, Planned Parenthood uses completely separate funds to provide these services. 
   Ninety-seven percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides are related to pregnancy prevention and women's health. The majority of their work focuses on low-income women, a population at greater risk for unintended pregnancies. Oftentimes a local Planned Parenthood clinic is the only place where women have access to basic health care, including birth control. In addition to family planning assistance, Planned Parenthood also provides cancer screening for breast and cervical cancers, as well as testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS. These are essential health services for women, and it would be irresponsible to discontinue Federal funding for them. I urge my colleagues to support healthcare and family planning for women by voting no on this amendment.

As cochair of the Human Trafficking Caucus and as an original cosponsor, I am pleased that this bill  will provide strong, new, innovative, flexible tools to combat modern-day slavery, whether labor exploiters, diplomats who abuse their servants, or brutal pimps. 
   I want to commend the extra offered leadership of Chairman Lantos and Chairman Conyers, as well as LAMAR SMITH and RANDY FORBES, and their staffs, for bringing this important bill to the floor. I truly do believe that books will be written about this effort, a major one, to end this terrible abuse of human people. 
   I ask my colleagues to look at this picture. I want them to see that the lives of trafficking victims are pure horror. If you look at the first line, each girl looks different, but after one or two years, they all look the same, shells of people. In the end, they have been abused, psychologically captured, broken and devastated at the hands of their pimps. 
   The fight against human trafficking has brought together Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, religious leaders and secular leaders. I will place in the Record a list of the very large bipartisan coalition that was sent to the Department of Justice and our colleagues and signed by many advocates, including Gloria Steinem, Jessica Neuwirth, Kim Gandy, Tony Campolo, Jim Wallis, Ron Sider, Walter Fauntroy and Beverly LaHaye, among many others. 
   The bipartisan bill before us is historic and will dramatically strengthen our capability to fight human trafficking. 
   Mr. Speaker, I became interested in this when Big Apple Oriental Tours in my district was advertising sex tours, sex trafficking. Come to the Philippines, come here, come there, and we will give you a young girl, many young girls. We could not close them down. 
   With this Congress in a bipartisan way, we have strengthened the laws to crack down on this terrible human abuse. This bill before us gives law enforcement even greater tools to go after the predators.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, yesterday, the United States Congress lost a dear friend, a true humanitarian, and a real statesman, Chairman Tom Lantos of California. 
   I extend my deepest sympathies to Tom's dedicated wife Annette, his daughters Annette and Katrina, and to his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We are thinking of them during this difficult time and hope they will find solace in knowing that their husband, father, and grandfather was a true hero and role model for so many of the people he touched. 
   Chairman Lantos was unrelenting in his lifelong commitment to defending the oppressed. He decisively chose to serve his fellow human beings, often at great personal risk to himself. After escaping from Nazi labor camps in World War II, young Tom fought in the underground Nazi resistance and continued to fight for justice. His ability to triumph through tragedy is truly inspirational. 
   Tom embodied the American dream. In the summer of 1947, Tom was awarded a scholarship to study in the United States. He arrived in New York City with no money and only a Hungarian salami which was quickly seized by U.S. customs officials. With his incredible persistence and deep intellect, he soon earned his Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Tom was always thankful for the opportunities given to him by the United States and America is blessed to have had such a loyal citizen and distinguished leader. 
   Continuing his dedication to others, Tom served the American public and people of the world as an exemplary Member of Congress. He founded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and most recently served as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Standing by his convictions, Tom was arrested at the Embassy of Sudan for protesting human rights violations in Darfur. As a result of this brave action, the President renewed his call for a stronger international presence in Darfur. Tom continually defended those too often ignored by the international community. People of the world are indebted to him for his strong leadership in promoting human rights. 
   I am honored to have served in Congress with Congressman LANTOS and to have worked together on significant legislation defending the international human rights of women. His support was paramount to the achievement of many gains for women's human rights. 
   Together, we were able to provide direct assistance to advance the status of women in Afghanistan. We also collaborated on landmark legislation to stop human trafficking. I am deeply grateful for his commitment to the women of the world. 
   Chairman Tom Lantos will always be remembered with respect and gratitude. He consistently gave voice to the voiceless and was their champion. His legacy of upholding human dignity will continue to inspire future generations of Americans.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 526, a resolution that supports both homeownership and responsible lending. This resolution is on the floor today because we are facing, by all accounts, a tsunami of defaults and foreclosures in the primary subprime market. In each of our districts, our constituents are encountering payment shock as their subprime loans reset to much higher rates. By some estimates, 2.2 million homeowners with subprime loans made through 2006 will lose their homes. 
   As Chair of the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, I have held three hearings on this important and complex issue. At these hearings, we have heard from the Federal regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Association, and the Federal Reserve. Acting in a cooperative manner, the FDIC, OCC, OTS and the Fed have issued joint guidance that require financial institutions under their supervision to issue mortgages based on the customer's ability to repay that mortgage. 
   This commonsense guidance includes underwriting loans to the fully indexed rate and not just to the 2- or 3-year teaser rates that have been so popular over the last few years, as well as allowing borrowers a reasonable time to refinance without prepayment penalties. At these hearings, we have also heard from consumer groups and advocates who tell us that while this guidance is a good first step, 50 percent of the mortgage market comes from lenders outside of the oversight of these Federal regulators. 
   To effect real change, we need standardized rules over the entire market. One option that has frequently been mentioned is for the Federal Reserve to use its authority to stop unfair and deceptive practices under the HomeOwnership and Equity Protection Act. I am told that the Fed is looking into this. I fully support their using this authority that the Congress has given them in this area. 
   Beyond HOEPA, we must work together here in Congress to ensure that unfair lending practices are not rewarded and that our constituents have access to credit. Over the coming months, I plan to continue working with Chairman Frank and holding hearings on this issue and drafting legislation to address some of the problems that have been highlighted both in this resolution and at our hearings. Each and every one of us here in Congress wants to ensure that the American Dream of homeownership does not become a nightmare for our constituents. I support this resolution. I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 556) to ensure national security while promoting foreign investment and the creation and maintenance of jobs, to reform the process by which such investments are examined  for any effect they may have on national security, to establish the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and for other purposes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues who voted for this bill unanimously are as delighted as I am to see H.R. 556, the CFIUS reform bill, once again on this floor, this time headed for the President's desk. 
   Strengthening the system of review of foreign direct investment in this country is, as this body has recognized repeatedly, an important national and strongly bipartisan interest. 
   When the Dubai Ports World matter became front page news a year and a half ago, most Americans had no idea that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States existed or what it did. 
   The Dubai Ports World debacle made clear that the CFIUS process needed strengthening and oversight, both to ensure that foreign investment here does not jeopardize our national security in a post-9/11 world and to encourage and support safe foreign investment in this country to create jobs and boost our economy. This bill is designed to accomplish both of these important goals. 
   As my colleagues will remember, one of the first bills passed by the Financial Services Committee in this Congress and brought to the floor was the original version of this legislation. I am delighted to say that the Senate adopted our bill with very few changes, and it is back here for final passage.     
   This has been a long and consistently bipartisan effort in which several Members played key roles and deserve special recognition. 
   I would like to especially thank Chairman Frank and the Democratic leadership, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, for their support. They made this bill a priority and quickly moved it forward for passage. 
   I also thank Minority Whip Roy Blunt for his work, both in this Congress and in the last, in putting together a coalition to build support for CFIUS reform. Congressman Joe Crowley and Congressman Luis Gutierrez played a key role in that coalition, and I thank them. 
   My former colleague on the Monetary Policy Subcommittee, Congresswoman Pryce of Ohio, worked with me to hold hearings on this bill in the last Congress. Those hearings built on the seminal report from the GAO on the weaknesses in the CFIUS process. 
   I also thank Congressman Thompson of Mississippi and Congressman King of the Homeland Security Committee, who encouraged this bill from the start. 
   I would like to thank those Members' staff, particularly Scott Morris, Joe Pinder, Kevin Casey, Peter Freeman, Kyle Nehvins; my subcommittee staff director, Eleni Constantine and Ed Mills for their tireless work on this bill over the past 2 years. 
   I would also like to thank the Senate for moving forward promptly on this key issue and for adopting our bill and our bill number. 
   In particular, I thank Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby for their bipartisan work in moving this forward and their staffs for the careful dedication they gave to every detail of this legislation. 
   Finally, I would like to the thank Secretary Paulson, Deputy Secretary Kimmitt, Undersecretary Steel and Assistant Secretary Lowery. It is they and their successors who will ensure that the CFIUS process works under Congress's oversight. I have appreciated the dialogue we have had over the past 2 years on how the reforms we propose will be implemented, and in some cases, they already have been. 
   This bill is necessary now more than ever. As the Wall Street journal reported this week, a growing number of countries are imposing new restrictions on foreign investment that go well beyond the strict focus on national security concerns embodied in this legislation. 
   The story indicates that the new hostility to foreign acquirers reflects a perception that the United States is erecting new barriers to foreign capital. Today's legislation establishes in unequivocal terms that this perception is false. 
   By strengthening and clarifying the national security review process and maintaining a strict focus on national security, the CFIUS reforms embodied in H.R. 556 clearly endorse the open investment policy of the United States while enhancing our national security protections. In the name of national security, the President can intervene in any transaction, and, similarly, CFIUS can condition approval of a deal on being able to reopen a review. But this bill provides clarity and certainty for investors by requiring a finding by CFIUS that all other remedies have been exhausted before CFIUS can reopen a review. 
   I would note that the certain and transparent CFIUS procedures in this bill stand in stark contrast to actions by some foreign governments where expropriations of assets have occurred arbitrarily without justification and without recompense for U.S. investors. By passing this bill, we continue our long-standing efforts to ensure that U.S. investors are treated with the same certainty and fairness in foreign markets as we give foreign investors in this bill. 
   This bill makes several necessary reforms. First, it creates CFIUS by statute, so that its operations, membership and procedures have a sound basis in law, and we are reviewable by Congress. 
   Second, it requires a full 45-day investigation of foreign government investment, in addition to the 30-day review, which can only be waived by the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of Treasury. While many foreign governments' transactions are harmless, they also pose certain inherent risks. Governments have more assets and resources than private sector participants and may have nonmarket motives. 
   Third, it requires review and sign-off on every transaction, by a high-level official. When the Ports World deal became public, no senior official could be found who knew about the approval before it happened. The House bill required all approvals to be made by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. The Senate bill allows a Deputy Secretary to make a decision, but it also mandates the creation of a special assistant secretary at Treasury whose portfolio would be CFIUS matters. By restricting the additional decision-making ability to one out of the many assistant secretaries at the Treasury, this preserves the accountability and high-level review that motivated the original delegation provision.  
   Fourth, the bill requires reporting to Congress after the conclusion of reviews. While we do not want to politicize the process of security review, we also want to assure proper oversight. 
   Fifth, it creates and places and puts in place the importance of review by the National Intelligence Director. 
   Six, it requires tracking of transactions that are withdrawn from the process. Since deals are often withdrawn because they hit a snag in the initial course of review, it is necessary to make sure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent whatever potential risk was spotted. 
   For example, this was the case with a Smartmatic transaction that I brought to the attention of Treasury last summer as a matter requiring CFIUS review. As you may recall, press reports indicated that Smartmatic, which had just bought the second largest voting machine company in the United States, Sequoia Voting Systems, had ties to the Venezuelan government. 
   I thought those allegations needed to be investigated by the body with the power to really get into the tangled ownership of the company, which is CFIUS. Under the broad and flexible definition of national security that the bill puts in place, certainly the ownership of voting machines is a potential national security issue.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's hard work on this bill and his statements, but I would like to clarify that CFIUS is a consensus body, so each member does and will continue to have an effective veto. This bill does not affect that ability in any way. Chairman Frank of the committee made that very clear in his statements in committee and on the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the body tonight. 
   I rise in strong support of the bridge loan of $15 billion to three of the largest manufacturers in America. 
   In response to my good friend on the other side of the aisle, if you're concerned about saving small businesses, there are literally thousands of small businesses that are associated with the auto industry in our country. 
   I would like to put in the Record a report that my office and I worked on that shows the ripple effect of the loss of these jobs in America. Over 3 million jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the auto industry--one in seven manufacturing jobs, many small businesses, the auto dealers, the suppliers. This is a major employer in America. 
   Last month, we lost over 533,000 jobs. Unemployment is at 6.7 percent. If this industry fails, the unemployment rate will jump to, roughly, 8.3 percent. Our fragile economy is in a crisis. We can not afford to lose these jobs. Other countries support their auto industries. We should, too.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, as Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I am pleased to speak in the time reserved by the Budget Act for a discussion of economic goals and policies that is traditionally led by members of this committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to chart a more sensible course for economic policy than has been pursued over the past 6 years, and this budget starts us down that path. 
   The President says his policies are working to make the economy strong, and that all Americans are benefiting. But evidence of a slowing economy is building, and an anxiety over the state of the economy remains high. The meltdown in the subprime mortgage market is also adding to worries about the overall health of the economy. 
   American families are optimistic by nature, but they are understandably worried about the future, because the economy is weakening, even before many have shared in the gains from the economic growth we have seen so far. 
   Despite 5 years of economic expansion, most American families have struggled just to hold their economic ground on President Bush's watch. Job growth has been modest. Wages are barely keeping pace with inflation. Real incomes have fallen, household debt is rising, employer-provided health insurance coverage is declining, and private pensions are in jeopardy. 
   These are the economic barometers that matter most to America's families. Having a job is the key indicator of economic well-being for the vast majority of Americans. The President likes to talk about these 7.5 million jobs created since August of 2003, but he neglects to mention the fact that more than a third of those jobs were necessary just to replace the ones that were destroyed between 2001 and 2003. 
   Most Americans depend on their earnings to support themselves and their families. But unfortunately, workers' pay has lagged far beyond productivity, and wage growth has been weaker and more unequal than in the late 1990s. Strong productivity growth has translated into higher profits for businesses. Corporate profits are at an all-time high as a share of GDP, but not more take-home pay for the average worker. 
   Focusing on usual weekly earnings of full-time workers, we see only modest gains concentrated in the upper half of the distribution from 2000 to 2006. As we see in this chart, the red bars show the unequal gains during the Bush administration, and the blue bars show the Clinton years when earnings grew for everyone across our country. 
   The divergence between the haves and the have-nots in the Bush administration economy stands in marked contrast to the last 4 or 5 years of the Clinton administration when real wage gains were strong up and down the wage ladder as productivity growth first accelerated. 
   These earnings figures do not reflect bonuses of highly paid executives or capital gains and other nonwage income earned at the very top of the income distribution. This picture likely understates the disparities. The people experiencing the largest income gains are executives and highly compensated individuals, while ordinary American workers are only just beginning to see some gains in their paychecks after inflation. 
   Workers' pay and benefits, the red line, have grown only half as much as productivity; the blue line over the last 6 years. Typically, real compensation of workers, their wages and benefits, tend to track productivity growth as  they did in the late 1990s. But that has not happened since the 2001 recession. Productivity growth has been strong, but real inflation-adjusted compensation growth has been weak. 
   The compensation growth we have seen came much more from benefits than from wages, but not because employers suddenly became more generous. Benefit costs have been increasing because health insurance costs are rising and employers have had to make contributions to restore the solvency of their pension plans.     
   Higher benefit costs have squeezed take-home pay, but workers have not been getting more generous benefits in return. Slow job growth and stagnant wages during much of the Bush administration have depressed families' incomes. Median household income in 2005 was nearly $1,300 lower than in 2000, a loss of 2.7 percent during the President's first 5 years in office. Clearly, many American families have a lot of lost ground to make up. 
   Those who are already well-to-do are doing very well in this Bush economy, but the typical American family is struggling to make ends meet in the face of high costs for energy, health care and a college education for their children. 
   College tuition is up 44 percent, health insurance premiums are up 87 percent, and the price of gasoline was only a $1.45 per gallon when the President took office. 
   Somehow, the President's tax cuts were supposed to make up for all of this. But the lion's share of the tax cuts went to the people at the very top, especially the top 1 percent of earners. 
   The legacy of the President's tax cuts has been to run up massive deficits and debt that leave us unprepared to deal with the budget challenges posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation, and that weakens the future standard of living of our children and grandchildren. 
   This administration has presided over a stunning reversal of fortune. The $5.6 trillion, 10-year budget surplus that they inherited turned into a deficit over those same 10 years of at least $2.3 trillion. 
   The administration has incurred the three largest budget deficits on record, including a $413 billion deficit in 2004. The deficit may be retreating, as it usually does in a business cycle recovery, but each year's deficit still stands in marked contrast to the projected surpluses when the President took office. 
   The gross Federal debt is now almost $9 trillion, or more than $29,000 per person. That is how much every man, woman and child in America owes to this debt. This is the fiscal mess that we have to clean up. Thanks to the President's policies, we are now a Nation of debtors, relying on the rest of the world to finance our budget deficits and excessive spending. 
   Our current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of our trade deficit with the rest of the world, rose to a record-smashing $856 billion in 2006, from $791 billion in 2005. 
   This administration keeps giving us records, but they are the wrong kind of records. Record deficits, record debts, and record amounts of money owed by each American citizen. The amount of Federal debt owed by foreigners has more than doubled under President Bush, rising to $2.2 trillion, with Japan and China alone holding $1 trillion of our debt. 
   Recent stock market volatility underscores just how vulnerable the U.S. economy has become to the decisions being made in other countries. When China sneezes, a half a world away, the U.S. economy catches a cold. 
   Our future prosperity depends on increasing our normal saving and making wise investments. It depends on being ready for the retirement of the baby boom generation and the pressure we know that that will put on our budget. 
   The challenge for this Congress is to return to the fiscal discipline that has been squandered by the President and Congress over the past 6 years, and that is what this Democratic budget proposal does. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind my dear friend on the other side of the aisle that the Bush administration has given this country several records, only they are the wrong kind of records: $9 trillion in debt, the largest debt this country has ever carried; $859 billion trade deficit, the current account deficit, the largest trade deficit in the history of this country. And out of that $9 trillion, each of us in this room and each person across America owes $29,000. That is their portion of the debt that we owe. 
   Once again, we have heard about job creation. As I have said earlier, a third of the jobs created since 2003 were necessary just to make up for earlier job losses. Under President Clinton, the economy created 237,000 jobs per month, and this administration has created well less than 100,000 jobs per month.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. First of all, Mr. Chairman, I find it rather ironic that my good friends on the other side of the aisle are lecturing us on fiscal responsibility. After all, let us remember that the $5.6 trillion 10-year budget surplus that Mr. Bush and the Republican majority at that time inherited turned into a deficit over those same 10 years of at least $2.3 trillion. Numbers do not lie, Mr. Chairman. They turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $2.3 trillion deficit. And they are preaching fiscal responsibility. 
   The administration has incurred the three largest budget deficits on record, including a $413 billion deficit in 2004. And let's remember that the Bush administration not only lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since they took office, but we now have almost a $9 trillion debt, and that breaks down to all of us in America owing, our own individual share, $29,000. Now, that is what they have given the American people. 
   On top of that they gave us another record, another horrible record. The highest trade deficit in the history of our country, $857 billion. So they give us the record debt, the record trade deficit, and the record budget deficit in the history of this country, and they are talking fiscal responsibility. And then on top of it they turn the surplus into a $2.3 trillion deficit. 
   Believe me, I am so glad that for the future of America we have a Democratic budget before us today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from the great State of Washington, Congressman McDermott.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the American people voted for change, and this Democratic leadership has given them change, not only in the direction in Iraq but the direction in our budget. 
   I repeat, it is unbelievable. I am mystified that the Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking fiscal discipline. Let us remember, they are the ones that gave us the largest debt in history, $9 trillion, the largest trade deficit, over $859 billion, and they turned the $5.6 trillion 10-year budget surplus into a $2.3 trillion deficit. That is what they gave this country. 
   Within the first 100 hours of this Congress, the new Democratic leadership instituted pay-as-you-go budgeting requiring that new spending be offset. In other words, we are not spending money we don't have. We are not going to grow that deficit. Adhering to this policy helped turn deficits into surpluses in the 1990s during the Clinton administration but was abandoned by the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. That is what led us to these huge debts and deficits. 
   Today, Democrats in Congress present a realistic budget plan that adheres to PAYGO principles for controlling the deficit and bringing revenues into line with the amount we need to spend to defend the country and take care of the needs of our citizens. 
   Our budget provides health care for millions of additional uninsured children. We make investments in veterans health care and benefits. We restore critical funding for first responders and State and local law enforcement. 
   In order to spur innovation that will keep America number one in the world, we provide increased funding for the National Science Foundation, increase investments in math and science and education, and make college more affordable for our young people, investing in the future of our country. 
   We also expand renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce global warming and dependence on foreign oil. 
   Democrats target tax relief to those who need it most. Our plan protects 19 million middle-American families from a tax increase by setting up a reserve fund for a long-term fix for the alternative minimum tax, which is snagging millions more families each year in its widening net. We pay for these tax cuts in part by eliminating tax loopholes and closing the tax gap to make sure that middle-class families don't have to pay the tab for tax cheats. 
   Mr. Chairman, this budget resolution is an important step toward putting our fiscal house back in order and creating greater economic opportunities and prosperity for all American families.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and for her leadership in this Congress, and I rise in strong support of my bill H.R. 5599, a bill to designate the Census Bureau headquarters Federal building for Founding Father Thomas Jefferson. 
   The Census Bureau has just been relocated to a modern state-of-the-art building in Suitland, Maryland. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Congresswoman Holmes Norton for their help in moving this bill forward. 
   I introduced this legislation along with colleagues that have been strong supporters of an accurate census--Holmes Norton, Hoyer, Davis, Turner, Ruppersberger, Honda, Gonzalez, Wynn, Cohen, and Cannon--to honor Thomas Jefferson's contributions to the modern census and the Founding Fathers' vision of a truly representative government in which every American counts. 
   Jefferson's role in establishing a republic based on the principle of fair  representation emphasizes the historical significance of the American census and the way our government views and governs itself today. Jefferson's significant contributions to the early American census include his alerting the Nation to the importance of accuracy in census taking and his recognition of the need to fully represent newly acquired territories in the census. 
   Historically, census taking was a negative thing. It was used for raising taxes for the militia. Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State, oversaw the first census in history, which was positive, which gave the people more than it took away by empowering those counted with a voice in their government. 
   As we have heard in recent weeks, the 2010 census has some very serious challenges. Although much work remains to be done to ensure its successful implementation, naming this building for Thomas Jefferson underscores this Congress' commitment to getting it right and making sure that every citizen is counted.     
   A fair and accurate census, putting political power in the hands of the people, is a uniquely American invention. Let us honor our Founding Fathers' legacy by celebrating Thomas Jefferson, the father of the modern census.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (DUST AND TOXINS FROM 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today on the House floor, we passed a very important bill to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security. Tonight, we must take time to remember the horrific event that made our Nation realize that we needed a Department of Homeland Security to begin with, the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   We will never forget that fateful day and the thousands of people who lost their lives, and now we know that thousands more lost their health. 
   We must not forget the firefighters, police officers, EMTs and other first responders who bravely rushed to save the lives of others, even as everyone else was running in the opposite direction. 
   Within hours of the collapse of the World Trade Center, those first responders labored alongside hard hats and average New Yorkers without regard for their own health or safety. They spent countless hours working the pit, sifting through the rubble, hoping against hope that they would be able to rescue someone trapped deep below. 
   Unfortunately, as the days went on and the mission turned from a rescue-and-recovery mission to a cleanup site, these brave men and women stayed. While they labored, most were not given the proper respiratory equipment, and all were given inaccurate information about the quality of the air they were breathing. They were told that the ``air was safe to breathe.'' They were told that it was not a health hazard to be there. 
   Let us take a closer look: This air, the air enveloped by this massive toxic dust cloud, they said was safe to breathe. Unfortunately, we now know better. We know more about what was in that cloud, a poisonous cocktail of thousands of tons of coarse and fine particulate matter, pulverized cement and glass and other toxic pollutants. 
   To the mix were added 24,000 gallons of burning jet fuel and plastics, which created a dense plume of black smoke containing cancer-causing volatile organic compounds, dioxins and hydrocarbons, a specific combination of toxins probably never seen before and hopefully that we will never see again. 
   And all of this went into the mouths, throats and lungs of tens of thousands of workers while they tirelessly worked long shifts, not thinking first of their health but of serving this great Nation. 
   Later in this hour, I am going to share with you the stories of the individual brave men and women who worked at ground zero, but now let me just share one about the dust. 
   This is a story from Denise Bellingham of Long Island, New York. In her own words, as reported in the New York Daily News, she said, ``The air was indescribable,'' as you can see. ``You couldn't eat anything that wasn't covered with dust. We had paper masks, but they were no good. Condensation from breathing turned the mask into mud. It was worse to breathe with it on. We got respirators about a week into it, but they were not fit-tested. They just came in boxes, and we grabbed one that might fit. 
   ``I worked more than 300 hours at ground zero. I considered it a thank you to America, a chance to do something for my country and for my fellow New Yorkers and for my co-workers who were buried in the rubble. 
   ``We never expected anything to go wrong. Every day we were told the air was safe to breathe. Working down there as a team gave us healing. We could feel all the angels, all the people who had died there.'' 
   Again, that was one of the personal accounts of work at ground zero, as reported in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Daily News series on the Forgotten Heroes of 9/11. 
   Now, well over 5 years after 9/11, we are seeing the potentially deadly effects on the thousands who worked around ground zero. This is in addition to the untold numbers of residents, area office workers and school children also exposed to the toxins of ground zero but have never received any medical monitoring or assistance from the Federal Government. 
   We have numerous peer-reviewed, scientific studies linking people's sicknesses to the toxins of ground zero. 
   Last year we learned from Mount Sinai, an important hospital in my district, and the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program that 70 percent of 9/11 responders suffered respiratory problems and 60 percent are still sick as a direct result of their work at ground zero. Making matters worse, nearly 40 percent of those screened have no health insurance, and for those who do have insurance, work-related illnesses are most often not covered. 
   We also learned from the fire department that the average New York City firefighter has lost 12 years of lung capacity following their service at ground zero, and many have been forced to retire or be reassigned due to their 9/11 illnesses. 
   And just 2 days ago, a new report from the fire department and Einstein College of Medicine in New York clearly linked World Trade Center dust to a rare type of lung-scarring disease, sarcoidosis, which involves an inflammation that produces tiny lumps of cells in the lungs. In some cases, the illness gets progressively worse and can be fatal. 
   Let there be no doubt. We now have scientific proof that the 9/11 health crisis is real, and that it is truly a matter of life and death.     
   Tonight I want everyone listening to understand this. The 9/11 health crisis is not only a New York City problem. The attacks on 9/11 were attacks against our Nation, not just New York. The whole country was touched; and, in the aftermath, people from every State in the Nation were exposed to these toxins while they assisted in the massive rescue recovery and cleanup efforts. Whether you came from California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Alaska, you breathed in the same toxic air. 
   Last month, Congressman VITO FOSSELLA and I released a report showing that Americans from all 50 States were exposed to the aftermath of 9/11 and have serious concerns about their health. 
   This map shows how many people from each State enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry, which is a comprehensive health survey of those most heavily exposed to the toxins of Ground Zero. Those who enrolled answered a 30-minute telephone survey about where they were and what they did on 9/11, and they were asked to report the status of their health. This will allow health professionals to compare the health of those most exposed  to the events of 9/11 with the health of the general population. 
   Over 71,000 people who met the eligibility requirements of direct exposure decided to enroll in the registry. We know that there are an estimated 410,000 people who would have been eligible, meaning that 410,000 people were likely directly exposed to the deadly toxins of 9/11. 
   Of the 71,000 people who were concerned enough about their health to enroll, over 8,000 live in New Jersey, over 1,200 live in California, another 1,200 live in Florida, 156 live in Arizona, 350 live in Georgia, 238 in Maryland, and 341 live in Texas. At least 28 people came from as far away as Hawaii. 
   The list goes on and on, but the message of this map is clear: This is a national emergency, and it deserves a strong Federal response. 
   Over 1,000 people are from Pennsylvania, including Ryan McCormick, who came to Ground Zero from Representative Dent's district in Pennsylvania. His father, David McCormick, sent me an e-mail explaining that Ryan was a paramedic for University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, who came to the aid of New York in our country in our time of need. 
   In his 5 days at Ground Zero, he served in many capacities. A year and a half later, he came down with Hodgkin's Disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system. He has undergone a great deal of chemotherapy and radiation, but nothing has worked. We sincerely thank Ryan for his service to our country, and we pledge that we will not forget his service or his health needs. 
   I also thank him for his hard work in getting the message out to country and Congress that we cannot forget the heroes of 9/11, and I am told that he is with us tonight in the gallery. We want to personally thank you for your service and your courage. 
   With a problem of this scope, what we need right now is a plan from the current administration on how they intend to medically monitor everyone who was exposed to the deadly toxins at Ground Zero, and we need a plan to treat everyone who is sick. That is the least that we can do for these heroes and heroines. 
   Along with my colleagues in New York and our entire delegation, I have been calling for a plan for years now. We don't have a plan yet, but we have made some important progress. 
   After a long fight with the administration, in May, 2003, we were successful in securing $90 million for medical monitoring for responders. 
   Then, with the leadership of Representative Shays, the Government Reform Committee started a series of important congressional hearings bringing this topic to light. 
   Then, after the President actually rescinded, they took out of the budget $125 million meant for New York recovery efforts, the New York delegation fought to have the $125 million restored in October of 2005. Of that, $50 million was set aside for workers' compensation, and $75 million was for medical monitoring and treatment. This was the first-ever Federal funding for treatment of sick 9/11 responders. 
   Unfortunately, then we had to fight just as hard to get that $75 million out of the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services and to the doctors and patients that need to be monitored and treated. 
   Finally, in late fall of this year, the $75 million was finally released to help the men and women who helped so many on 9/11. 
   While we were fighting to get that funding released, we took a step closer to having a coordinated Federal response when the Director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Dr. John Howard, was appointed at the request of the New York congressional delegation as the Federal coordinator for 9/11 health issues in February of 2006. 
   Since his appointment, we have seen the release of the first clinical guidelines on the physical health effects many have suffered from the World Trade Center attacks and a draft of autopsy guidelines. 
   We have also seen Assistant Secretary John Agwunobi appointed as leader of a task force on 9/11 health within the Department of Health and Human Services. While we were promised a plan from this new task force between February of this year, Congress has yet to see one. We still do not have a plan from the administration to medically monitor everyone exposed to those deadly toxins and treat those who are sick as a result of exposure in their hard work at Ground Zero. 
   That is why, along with Congressman Fossella, I have introduced a resolution which calls on the administration to create a comprehensive long-term plan to medically monitor everyone exposed and treat those who have become sick. 
   Along with many Members of Congress, I have also introduced the first comprehensive authorizing legislation to care for both the health and economic well-being of all those affected. Named after New York City Police Detective James Zadroga, one of the first 9/11 responders to have his death directly attributed to his exposure to the toxins of Ground Zero, this legislation combines and builds upon two pieces of legislation that we have previously introduced in the 108th and 109th Congress, the Remember 9/11 Health Act and the James Zadroga Act to reopen the Victims' Compensation Fund. 
   H.R. 1638, the James Zadroga Act, the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, has four main components. It provides, first, for medical monitoring and treatment; secondly, compensation; thirdly, research; and, fourthly, coordination. 
   To provide medical monitoring and treatment, the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act continues and expands the current programs at three Centers for Excellence dedicated to 9/11 health issues to all people exposed to the toxins of 9/11, including first responders, rescue, recovery and cleanup workers, area residents, office workers and students. It would ensure that everyone exposed is monitored, and everyone who is sick is treated. 
   With regard to compensation, the legislation reopens the September 11 Victims' Compensation Fund to provide individuals who have become sick with 9/11 compensation for their loss. We can't make a person whole by helping them with their health but not addressing their economic needs. 
   For research, H.R. 1638 directs the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct or support diagnostic and treatment research for health conditions that are associated with the exposure to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   To ensure coordination, the bill establishes the 9/11 Health Emergency Coordinating Council for the purpose of discussing, examining and formulating recommendations to improve coordination between the Federal, State and local problems and getting those governments on all three levels to work together. 
   Passing long-term comprehensive legislation like this, and securing funding in the meantime, has proven to be a long, hard fight. Those who are sick from 9/11 are fighting for their lives, and we cannot forget them. 
   I stand here tonight to promise that I will not rest until we have a system in place that medically monitors everyone exposed to the deadly toxins and treats who is sick. On 9/11, we had many, many people rush to save the lives of others, and many worked for days to help others. 
   One of my colleagues has a constituent who is suffering from his exposure. He has been treated with chemotherapy. He, I understand, is here in the gallery tonight, up here. We applaud him and thank him for his service. Our prayers, our thoughts, our hope, our work to pass this legislation is for you and for other workers like you who went to help others after the deadly attacks. 
   I now yield to my good friend and colleague from the great State of Pennsylvania that had over 1,000 of their residents now registered in the official registry of those who worked at Ground Zero and whom we need to monitor for the next 20 or 30 years.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his statement. I thank him for working so hard not only for Ryan McCormick, his constituent, but all the men and women who came from every State in this Nation, including Alaska and Hawaii, to work at Ground Zero and to try to help save lives and to try to clean up the debris that was there. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the New York Daily News Editorial Board won the Pulitzer Prize for its groundbreaking series of editorials entitled, ``9/11, The Forgotten Victims.'' 
   Now, I would like to share with you an excerpt from this award-winning series. It is called, ``Abandoned Heroes.'' 
   ``They cough. They wheeze. Their heads and faces pound with the pressure of swollen sinuses. They lose their breath with minor exertion. They suffer the suffocation of asthma and diseases that attack the very tissues of their lungs. They endure acid reflux, a painful indigestion that never goes away. They are haunted by the mental and emotional traumas of having witnessed horror. Many are too disabled to work, and some have died.'' 
   Like Ryan McCormick, who is with us tonight in the Gallery, there were many other heroes. Another hero was Christopher Hynes, and I would like to discuss him, from this award-winning series: 
   ``For Christopher Hynes, life as a forgotten victim of 9/11 is a battle of breath. Five years ago, Hynes was a 30-year-old, healthy, nonsmoking New York City police officer. Then, in September and October 2001, he was assigned to Ground Zero duty, spending more than 100 hours patrolling the area of the smoldering rubble of the Twin Towers. The air was thick with dust and smoky particles. 
   ``Today, Hynes, married and the father of a 4-year-old son, has sarcoidosis, a disease that scars lung tissues, and asthma, a disease that inflames and obstructs the airways of the lungs. He coughs constantly and cannot exert himself without losing breath. He survives with the help of steroids and performs restricted duties for the police department. 
   `` `I will probably have this for the rest of my life,' he says.'' 
   We must not forget him. We must provide him with health care and monitoring and treatment for the rest of his life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now would like to recognize my good friend and colleague, GERALD NADLER, who represents the Ground Zero area and has worked tirelessly on this issue. I grant the gentleman 7 minutes.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for his hard work and for his statement and for being here tonight. I know that he has many constituents such as Congressman Dent, and we thank Ryan McCormick for being with us in the Chamber tonight. 
   I want to talk about another victim of 9/11, Winston Lodge. He was written about in ``The Making of a Health Disaster'' which was originally published July 25, 2006; and I quote from the Daily News. 
   ``For Winston Lodge, life as a forgotten victim of 9/11 is the torment of chronically inflamed and bleeding sinuses. 
   ``5 years ago, Lodge was a 44-year old iron worker who helped build things. Then, called on to help dismantle the pile, he pitched in at Ground Zero for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for a month. 
   ``Today, Lodge's nose runs constantly and often bleeds. He suffers headaches from sinus pressure, has shortness of breath from chronic bronchitis, and has acid reflux, a painful heartburn. He has undergone surgery to relieve sinus difficulties and is waiting for a second operation. 
   ``Since 2004, Lodge, a divorced father of four, has not been able to work; and he says, and I quote, ``I am sick to my bones, and I need help.'' 
   A number of people have worked very hard on this and held hearings to focus on this issue, including Mrs. Clinton and, very recently, ED TOWNS had one in Brooklyn, New York, about the health impacts on his constituents in Brooklyn. He held another one here in Washington. 
   But the first person to call a series of hearings on the health impacts of 9/11 was my colleague from Connecticut, CHRISTOPHER SHAYS. Under the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, he held hearings in New York, many here in Washington, that helped focus the light on the need for everyone to be monitored who was exposed to those deadly toxins and everyone who is sick to be treated. We thank you for holding those hearings and for joining us tonight in this special order. Thank you, Mr. Shays.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Well, I thank my colleague and good friend from Connecticut; and I thank him particularly for the public hearings that really focused the need and, I think, helped us achieve partial funding, the $25 million that we got in the President's budget. As we know, JERRY and the New York delegation, along with Senators CLINTON and SCHUMER, we have worked very hard to have $50 million added to the supplemental budget for the health needs of the 9/11 workers. This has been a delegation-wide priority on both sides of the aisle led by our two Senators and by the entire delegation. 
   I remember your hearings very vividly, the men and woman who came and testified who were sick. They came with their pills. They came with their coughs. Some could hardly breathe. They could hardly talk. 
   I want to share another story with my colleagues of Jeffrey Endean, who was highlighted in the Daily News articles as life as a forgotten victim of 9/11. And he says, 5 years ago, he was a 51-year old Division Commander for Morris County New Jersey's Sheriff Office. He was healthy, able to run several miles. 
   Then he was pressed into Ground Zero service because he had experience helping first responders cope at horrific scenes. He worked 12 hours a day, from September 11 to November 22, 2001. 
   Today, he has reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, RADS, a rare irritant-induced form of asthma. His sinuses often bleed. He is prone to headaches and upper respiratory infections. 
   Married, the father of three and grandfather of three, he retired in 2003; and he says, ``I start the day with four to five inhalers and a pill. Will I have cancer at 66? Will I live my life as long as I should?'' 
   That is the question, and that is why JERRY and CHRIS and I have worked so hard to have monitoring. And we need to continue this monitoring treatment not just for the next 5 years but doctors say for the next 20 or 30 years. New diseases are coming up. Pulmonary fibrosis, where the fibers in the lungs, they can hardly breathe. It's like an iron lung. 
   And, JERRY, you were at those hearings. Can you comment and add to what CHRIS said about the hearings? And JERRY and I and CHRIS really represent many people who work there, the residents. We need to get the residents into the registry, too.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. That is very true. But I also want to build on what he said, that people are going to be watching how we treat these first responders. God forbid that we have another 9/11 attack or another terrorist attack, they are going to know that we weren't there to provide, at the very least, the health care and the monitoring that the heroes and heroines need, and that is a very important precedent. It is not only, do we need to take care of these men and women, Mr. McCormick, who is with us tonight in the Gallery, but we have to send a message that we are going to be there for our first responders.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I know. There were lots of terrible mistakes that are causing people their health now. 
   And in closing in this final minute, I just want to underscore that we as a Nation must not forget the firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians and all the other responders, volunteers and residents who bravely rushed down to save lives even as everyone else was running in the opposite direction. We must not forget the rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who stayed on for months at Ground Zero in service to our country. And we must not forget the residents, area workers and school children who lived, worked and studied through the toxins and have now become sick. 
   Once again, I stand on this floor of Congress and note that this was an attack against our Nation, and we know that the Nation responded. Every State has workers that were affected by the deadly toxins at Ground Zero. Every State had residents who rushed to our State and rushed down to Ground Zero to help. We will never forget them, and we will not stop. Both sides of the aisle, we are committed to making sure that everyone who was exposed to the deadly toxins is treated and everyone who is sick is going to get medical care. That is the least that we can do for these brave men and women. 
   I thank my colleagues and especially Ryan McCormick, who is here with us tonight, for coming. And I thank you for your work not only tonight on this Special Order tonight but throughout your year in Congress. Since 9/11, it has been a priority of yours. And my constituents, the thousands that were affected thank you for your efforts, and I thank you for having this opportunity of joining me in this Special Order.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, the Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. 
   This is the perfect capstone to an extremely productive week. 
   I came to Congress to help our seniors gain access to benefits they need and deserve, so I thank Chairman Dingell and the new Democratic leadership of the House for bringing this vitally important bill to a vote during the first 100 hours. 
   In 2003, I voted against the prescription drug bill because, among other things, it did not provide adequate benefits to our seniors and did nothing to contain the rising costs of drug prices. 
   Current law states that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, unlike the Veterans' Administration, is expressly prohibited from negotiating the best drug prices on behalf of the 43 million seniors and others in Medicare who desperately need the lowest price available. 
   Price data show that Part D plans are not delivering on the promise that competition would bring prices down and that the use of market power has not resulted in drug prices that are comparable to the low prices negotiated by the VA. 
   H.R. 4 cuts the cost of healthcare and improves access to medicines by requiring HHS to negotiate with drug companies for lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and greater savings for our taxpayers. 
   It's commonsense, it's good business sense, and it makes sense for our seniors. 
   Negotiations that lower prescription drug prices will help many consumers avoid the doughnut hole by preventing them from ever hitting the coverage gap where they have to pay thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket expenses for medications while still paying their monthly insurance premiums. 
   H.R. 4 does not dictate to the HHS Secretary how to negotiate but instead provides the Secretary with broad discretion on how to best implement the negotiating authority and achieve the greatest price discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The bill also ensures that Congress is able to closely monitor the administration's progress by requiring HHS to report to Congress every 6 months on drug price negotiation. 
   Under the current system, the pharmaceutical companies are the ones who benefit at the expense of our seniors, many of whom are forced to choose between paying for their prescription drugs and putting food on the table. 
   H.R. 4 seeks to help those who need it most. Older Americans are watching us today, waiting to see if we will act to make their prescription drugs more affordable and more accessible. 
   I am proud to cast a vote in support of America's seniors and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2956, the ``Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act.'' 
   This legislation would accomplish what the majority of the American people have said over and over that they support--the redeployment of American troops from Iraq. H.R. 2956 would require this redeployment to begin within 120 days, with completion to a limited presence by April 1, 2008. 
   The evidence continues to mount that the surge is not working. More than 3,500 troops have lost their lives and more than 26,000 have been wounded since this war began. The costs are too great to continue this failed policy. 
   The progress report that was presented to Congress today states that the Iraqi government has made limited progress in meeting political, economic, or security benchmarks and in some instances has made virtually no progress at all. The President said that when the Iraqis stand up, our troops will stand down. More than four years later, we are still waiting. 
   Increasingly, Republican senators are coming forward to announce that they support a change in policy in Iraq. I am glad that they are finally accepting what many of us have been saying for months. Yet the President continues to dig in by promoting his failed policy against the will of the American people and despite dwindling support within his own party. 
   This bill establishes a new direction for our forces in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to listen to their constituents and support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and just say this is an incredibly important bill. It will expand the number of units of affordable housing and expand the number of vouchers to over 100,000. That's extremely important to the American people. 
   And in response to the gentleman, if he cared so much about his amendment, he should have offered it during the committee. Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters held hearings and thoroughly discussed every amendment. The committee met for 2 complete days and thoroughly discussed every amendment. If the gentleman wanted and cared about his amendment, he should have put it forward before the committee. 
   The rule is very fair. Out of the six amendments that had have been accepted, three are Republican, one is bipartisan, and the other is a bipartisan manager's amendment. So the gentleman is not looking at what is the real issue. The real issue is providing affordable housing that is desperately needed in our country. Many families are facing the increased cost of living, and there is a lack of affordable housing. I object strenuously to the facts in the statement by my good friend on the other side of the aisle.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1853, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007 (SEVRA). This bill comes before the House at a critical time. 
   Right now too many Americans face the double onslaught of stagnant wages and ever increasing costs of living, including a critical lack of affordable housing. That is why it is so important to send a strong message to our constituents that we support stable, safe and affordable communities. 
   Affordable housing is a critical component of this, and Section 8 housing vouchers provide vital rental assistance for low-income families, seniors, and the disabled. I am pleased to report that this legislation comes to the floor with  the strong bipartisan support of the Financial Services Committee which passed this bill in May by a vote of 52-9. 
   This bill makes a number of changes to the Section 8 voucher, project-based and public housing programs. Specifically this bill: 
   Makes the Voucher Funding Formula More Efficient. The bill reforms the formula used to allocate Section 8 voucher funds to housing agencies to increase the number of families receiving vouchers. 
   Creates 100,000 New Vouchers. We authorize 20,000 new incremental vouchers a year over each of the next 5 years. 
   The Bill Promotes Homeownership. By allowing families to use housing vouchers as a down-payment on a first-time home purchase. 
   Encourages economic self-sufficiency for low income voucher and public housing families. H.R. 1851 includes a number of provisions designed to create incentives for families to obtain employment, increase earned income, pursue higher education, and save for retirement. No longer will our voucher formula discourage and penalize a voucher holder from seeking and obtaining employment. 
   Protects Tenants. The bill preserves the rights of voucher families to move to other areas, it addresses excessive voucher rent burdens, provides for more accurate fair market rent calculations to protect voucher holders in units that are in need of repair. 
   Stronger families and communities are a key part of the Democrats' New Direction for America. This bill strongly aids this goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, a new report that just came out by the Government Accountability Office shows that the United States lags far behind other industrialized countries in providing policies that help families balance the competing demands of work and family responsibilities. 
   Critics argue that implementing such policies here could have a negative impact on the economy, but many countries with strong work-family policies are among the world's most competitive economies in the world and have unemployment rates that are the same or lower than the United States. 
   More and more businesses are finding that doing right by workers is good for the bottom line. Paid parental and sick leave, flexible work schedules and access to child care provide a boost to worker productivity, retention, and recruitment that outweigh the cost of implementing such policies. 
   U.S. workers, businesses, and the economy would benefit from stronger work-family policies.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying bill, and I congratulate this Democratic majority and this speaker for making security an absolute priority and for implementing all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and making it a priority. 
   This bill was H.R. 1, the first bill introduced under the Democratic Congress, and it increases funding in many areas, particularly the interoperability of first responders' phones. The phones did not work on 9/11; the communications did not work. They still do not work. This will move us towards safer responding of our first responders. Over $4 billion for rail and security and trains and buses. And very, very importantly, it calls that our grants, our grants that are based on high threat, on security risks is based just on that, security risks, so that the money goes where it is needed, not in pork barrel politics. 
   And today marks the end of a very long journey that, along with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Representative Shays and 9/11 family members, when we joined together and formed the 9/11 Commission Caucus and introduced legislation to implement all of the recommendations. While the bill that was signed into law in 2004 did not include everything in the recommendations that our bill called for, it was a necessary first step in the process, and we are completing that process today. 
   The first bill was the first bill of major reorganization of our government since 1946. It coordinated all of our 15 different agencies under the National Intelligence Director, and it moved us in the right direction. This bill completes the recommendations of the commission in a bipartisan way. All the members have endorsed this legislation. 
   I want to note the heroic efforts of the 9/11 family members, including Mary and Frank Fetchet; Beverly Eckert; Carol Ashley; Abraham Scott; Rosemary Dillard; and Carrie Lemack. They have worked selflessly and tirelessly for years to pass this. They are an inspiration to me and this body, and I do not believe these bills would have passed without them. 
   Particularly, I want to note the provisions in the conference report that strengthen the privacy and civil liberties board more to the way that the 9/11 Commission recommended: a strong board, not the very weak one that the previous majority championed. 
   This bill establishes a strong, independent board with subpoena power. And this conference report will achieve many more significant reforms. It will make our country safer. I urge my colleagues to support this rule, the underlying bill, so that we will strengthen our homeland security and our defenses against another terrorist attack. It is based on merit. It is based on the 9/11 Commission Report. I urge an ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, for almost 4 years the administration has been saying, just give us more time, just give us more money, our plan will bring peace. And now they are saying, we need more troops, 48,000 of them. But we have already had four troop increases since we went into Iraq and none of them have brought stability. 
   Tragically, this war has cost more than 3,100 American lives, 143 from my home State of New York, and thousands of Iraqi lives, as well as more than 20,000 injured American soldiers who will carry their wounds for the rest of their lives. 
   The bipartisan Hamilton-Baker Commission called for a different approach. They said: ``The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating.'' As Mr. Hamilton said: ``The current approach is not working. And the ability of the U.S. to influence events is diminishing.'' 
   The commission called for greater use of diplomacy. And the commission's report stated clearly that we must not make an open-ended commitment to keep large numbers of American troops in Iraq. They warned that doing so would continue to stretch our troops too thin, hampering our abilities to simultaneously face other threats in the world. 
   It would severely affect America's army readiness, and it would not give the Iraqi Government the incentive needed to help bring security. If this assessment is so clearly in opposition to a long-term deployment in Iraq, why is the administration doing the exact opposite? 
   They are calling for a bigger commitment of troops, for more expenditure of lives and treasure with no end in sight. They speak of victory, but what is victory? Was it finding weapons of mass destruction? There were none. Was it a nuclear weapons program? There was not one. Was Iraq an imminent threat to our security? We were told it was, but in fact it was not. 
   They claimed that they would exhaust all options before taking military action. But they did not even wait for the weapons inspectors' final report. Was our goal to impose democracy on the entire Middle East? The war has inflamed and destabilized the region. Whatever their justification, they have embarked on a policy that is dragging America into the mire of another country's civil war. 
   In this civil war we don't know who's shooting. We just know that all sides are shooting at us. We also now know that there was no al Qaeda connection in Iraq before we invaded. The Pentagon's Inspector General has reported that Douglas Feith, the Pentagon's Under Secretary, cooked intelligence reports to make a case to go to war based on al Qaeda. It is tragically ironic that now by invading we have actually made Iraq fertile territory for al Qaeda recruitment. 
   Madam Speaker, on top of their rush to war and their insufficient planning, their mismanagement is legendary. They initially estimated that the war would cost 50 to $60 billion. But by the end of this year, Congress will have spent about half a trillion dollars, ten times the original estimate. 
   Last week, we had a hearing on $12 billion that was airlifted into the war zone and now $8.8 billion is unaccounted for, completely missing. Madam Speaker, how much mismanagement and misdirection can this country tolerate? 
   In November, Americans voted for a new direction for the war, a new direction for Congress. I rise in support of this new direction and against this escalation in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (SCHIP VETO OVERRIDE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, a new report by the Joint Economic Committee shows that a million more children a year may need public health insurance due to worsening economic conditions, even apart from the growing trend in public coverage. 
   If history is any guide, an economic downturn will lead to substantial increases in the demand for children's health and Medicaid, including some 70,000 additional children in each year of a downturn in my home State of New York. 
   Yet the administration is proposing a range of cutbacks to these programs that will make the problem even more severe. And State budgets are already strained by the weak national economy and the growing housing crisis. 
   This is a perfect economic storm that can be avoided if Congress votes today or tomorrow to override the President's veto of legislation that would bring health care to 10 million children in need. 
   Over the next 5 years, our bill would preserve coverage for the more than 6 million children currently covered by children's health care and extend coverage to nearly 4 million children who are currently uninsured. Overriding the President's veto of SCHIP reauthorization would guarantee sufficient funding levels for the Children's Health Program to serve future enrollment needs. Additional Medicaid assistance to the States would also provide shelter from the coming economic storm. Increasing the Federal Medicaid match percentage to the States as part of a stimulus package would help ease the blow of the economic slowdown on our children, families, and States. 
   I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of children's health care tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill which will restore some order to our Nation's housing market and will provide greater certainty to our economy. It was developed in a bipartisan way with the support of the administration. 
   Important aspects of this legislation include the FHA Housing Stabilization and Homeownership Retention Act, which provides mortgage refinancing assistance to keep at least 400,000 families from losing their homes and to help stabilize our housing market at no cost to the American taxpayer. This bill strengthens regulations of the GSEs by creating a strong independent regulator with real teeth, responsibility and power. 
   Very important for my district in New York and other high-cost areas, it raises the GSE loan limits. This bill creates a new permanent, affordable housing trust fund, a very creative effort led by our chairman, Barney Frank, financed by the GSEs and not by taxpayers, to fund the construction and maintenance of affordable rental housing for low and very low-income individuals and families nationwide in both rural and urban areas. 
   This bill includes important provisions that will provide for a backstop of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to shore up the housing market, a critical piece of restoring confidence in our economy. This is done by giving the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to increase the already existing line of credit to Freddie and Fannie for the next 18 months, as well as giving the Treasury Department stand-by authority to buy stock in these companies, to provide confidence in the GSEs and stabilize housing finance markets. 
   Not only are we addressing the current crisis but we are working to prevent future abuses and crises by establishing a nationwide loan originator licensing and registration system that will set minimum standards for loan originator licensing, substantially improving the oversight of the mortgage brokers and the whole industry. 
   It is a much-needed reform. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MALONEY of New York. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I wish to address the Chamber tonight on the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. 
   In recent years, the playing field between credit card companies and credit cardholders has become very one-sided. It is no surprise that it is average American cardholders and not the credit card companies who are getting the short end of the stick. 
   A credit card agreement is supposed to be a contract. But what good is a contract when only one party has any power to make decisions, and one party makes all the decisions? Cardholders deserve more bargaining power. The United States Congress can and should help level the playing field between card companies and cardholders. 
   I introduced the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, H.R. 5244, to give American credit cardholders a fair deal. We now have over 155 cosponsors in this body. My comprehensive credit card reform bill takes a balanced approach to reforming major industry abuses and improving consumer protections for cardholders. 
   Put simply, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights protects cardholders against arbitrary interest rate increases any time and for any reason; prevents cardholders from being unfairly penalized; protects cardholders from due date gimmicks; shields cardholders from misleading terms, and empowers them to set limits on their own credit and to better control their own credit; prevents card companies from giving subprime credit cards to people who cannot afford them; and requires Congress to provide much better oversight of the credit card industry in general. 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights fosters fair competition and free market values. It sets no price controls, no rate caps, and no fees. It merely requires the card companies to let consumers know when they are jacking their fees up and increasing their rates. I believe the free market works best when consumers are empowered to make their own choices, and my bill would give cardholders the information and the rights they need to make choices about their own credit. 
   The balanced provisions in my bill are the deliberative result of over a year of careful study and analysis. Over the last 2 years, I held numerous congressional hearings and meetings to determine how Congress, Federal regulators, and credit card companies could work together to help improve services and protections for cardholders. 
   There is no doubt that credit cards are very important to our economy. They offer cardholders instant access to a convenient and flexible source of financing, and have enabled many people to start new businesses, pay for tuition, or make other major purchases. Credit cards also provide many people with a safety net to help solve cash flow problems or cover unexpected expenses. But cardholders are increasingly confronting problems with unfair industry practices embodied in one-sided contracts, and this must be changed. 
   In recent months, the House of Representatives, under the leadership of Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, succeeded in passing major mortgage reform legislation and an economic stimulus plan. The Senate is now following suit. Both of these important steps will help get our economy back on track, but we cannot overlook credit card reform. It is a critical part of the equation, and one Congress will be turning its attention to. 
   Over 155 of my colleagues have already signed on as cosponsors of this important legislation. In the coming months, I plan to continue to build on the support this bill has gained, and I plan to work with Barney Frank to get this marked up in committee so we can bring it to the floor for a vote. 
   Consumers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on credit card reform that affects their lives. This is a critical issue of importance to my constituents, and we must show them that Congress is ready to restore some balance between consumers and credit card companies. 
   When I started to work on this issue, one of the first things I did was hold a roundtable discussion with many of the stakeholders, major credit card issuers, as well as leading consumer advocates. From this discussion, I developed a series of principles that have guided the development of the legislation. I am going to take a few minutes to describe each of these principles, explain what the bill does to achieve them, and provide real-world examples of what this means to the average credit cardholder. 
   The first principle is that cardholders deserve protection against arbitrary interest rates any time and for any reason. Right now, credit card companies have the right to raise a customer's interest rate for any reason. This has made it very difficult for many consumers to understand how and why they have had their interest rate changed and hiked up on their credit cards. 
   Compounding this problem is that when a new higher interest rate is applied, it not only affects future purchases, it also raises the interest rate on existing balances. Consumers are often only made aware of these new higher interest rate increases only after they have gone into effect. 
   To counter this problem, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights requires credit card companies to give a customer 45 days' notice of any and all interest rate hikes, and allows them the option to just say ``no,'' to opt out of the interest rate increase. In return, if the cardholder opts out of the new rate, they are required to close the card and pay off the existing balance at the payment schedule they agreed to. 
   And here is a real-world example. A person has a $1,000 balance and a 9.9 percent APR interest rate. One month, she pays her utility bill one day late. The credit card company charges her a $35 late fee and raises her interest rate from 9.9 percent to over 29 percent, but does not tell her about the rate increase until she gets her next statement in the mail. The new rate is applied to the entire existing balance of $1,000. And the consumer can try and get a new card at a lower rate, but until then the $1,000 debt will be growing at a 29.99 percent rate of interest. 
   Under the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, the customer would still be charged the late fee, but they would be notified that, in 45 days, their interest rate would be raised from 9.9 percent to over 29 percent. This would give them more time to try to apply for a new credit card with a lower interest rate; or, they could decline the higher interest rate on the card, close the account, and pay off the balance at the old 9.9 percent rate. 
   I have got to say, under the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, the customer could still be assessed the higher interest rate for missing payments on other bills, but that new higher rate would only apply to purchases and balances going forward and not retroactive on their existing balances. They would also have the ability to opt out of the rate increase, close the account, and pay off their existing balances at the old rate. 
   Another principle in the bill is that cardholders who pay on time and don't go over their limit should not be penalized. The so-called double cycle billing is a confusing practice that certain card companies employ to charge cardholders more interest. It affects cardholders who go from paying off their balances in full to carrying a balance. Here is how it works. 
   Most card companies charge interest on the remaining unpaid balance from a cardholder's previous billing cycle. Card companies that use double cycle billing, however, charge cardholders interest on the entire balance from the previous cycle even if the cardholder paid part of it off. Card companies that use double cycle billing are effectively charging interest on balances that have already been paid. How fair is that? The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights bans this really unfair practice called double cycle billing. 
   Here is a real-world example. A cardholder usually pays off her credit card  in full every month, but one month she charged $100 and only paid $50 by the due date. If she had a credit card that calculated payments on a single cycle, she would have been given credit for paying that $50 and only charged interest in the next billing cycle on the remaining $50 that she owed. But since her card company uses double cycle billing, she was charged interest on the $100 from the previous billing cycle plus the remaining $50 that she still owes. Under my bill, card companies would be prohibited from billing on a double cycle and charging interest on debt that has already been paid. 
   Another principle of this legislation is that cardholders should be protected from due date gimmicks. Currently, card companies are allowed to mail billing statements out as few as 14 days before the statement is due. Mail delays and a host of other problems mean that cardholders on that schedule find themselves with less than a week to get their payments back to their card company, increasing the likelihood that they will have a late payment. 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights gives cardholders more time to pay their bills. It requires card companies to mail billing statements 25 calendar days before the statement's due date. It also requires that payments made before 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on the due date are considered timely. The bill also prohibits card companies from charging late fees when a cardholder presents proof of mailing his or her bill within 7 days of the due date.     
   Another is that the bill and the cardholders should be protected from misleading terms and statements. Card companies can currently define the terms ``fixed rate'' and ``prime rate'' pretty much any way they want to. This can lead to obvious confusion among cardholders. 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights prevents card companies from using these terms in a misleading or in a deceptive manner by establishing single set definitions that every company must use. For example, the term ``fixed rate'' must be a rate that will not change or vary for any reason over a defined period of time. The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights also gives cardholders who get pre-approval for a card the right to reject that card up until the moment they are to use it or to activate it without having their credit adversely impacted. 
   I would like to say that, also, another principle is that cardholders deserve the right to set limits, and card companies should not impose excessive fees on cardholders. Most card companies currently don't give cardholders the option of setting real limits on their own accounts. Instead, card companies allow the cardholder to exceed that amount and assess fees and/or a rate increase for doing so. 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights would require card companies to offer consumers the option of having a fixed credit card limit that cannot be exceeded, and it would prevent card companies from charging over-the-limit fees on a cardholder with a fixed credit limit. 
   The bill also limits the amount of consecutive over-the-limit fees card companies can charge to a more reasonable number of three. Here is a real-world example. 
   A cardholder had a credit limit of $2,000 on her card. Things got a little tight around the holidays, and she used her card more than normal, accidentally going over her limit by $50. As a result, she was charged a $39 late fee. In the next billing cycle, she sent the card company a check for $60, but that still left her over her credit limit, so she was charged another $39 over-the-limit fee. 
   Under the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, the cardholder would be able to set his or her credit limit and wouldn't be able to make any purchases that put him over his fixed limit. If a cardholder did not want to set a fixed limit and did so accidentally go over his limit, a card company would only be allowed to impose more reasonable three consecutive, over-the-limit fees upon the customer. 
   Another principle of the bill is that card companies should fairly credit and allocate payments. When a credit card account has balances with different interest rates, a decision has to be made as to how to allocate payments. A cardholder pays the least amount of interest when any payment is allocated to the highest interest rate balance first, and a credit card company makes more in interest payments when the payment is allocated completely to the lowest rate balances. Currently, most credit card companies allocate payments to the lowest interest rate balance first while prohibiting payment on balances at higher interest rates until the lower rate balance is paid in full. This isn't very fair to the cardholder, however. In fact, many cardholders have no idea that their card companies are deciding to allocate their payments. 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights directs card companies to fairly allocate payments on balances at different interest rates, making payments more equitable for both cardholders and card companies. 
   Here is a real-life example of that principle. A cardholder has a new credit card given with an introductory zero percent interest rate on all balance transfers. So he transferred a $1,000 balance he had on another card. He then went out and bought $2,000 worth of new equipment. When he made a $250 payment on his new card that month, he noticed that his interest rate for new purchases was 24 percent, but all of his payment went to pay down the zero percent balance. He wanted to pay, obviously, on the $2,000 balance since it was at such a high interest rate, but he was told he could not start paying on that balance until the original zero balance was paid in full. 
   Under my bill, the $250 payment would go towards paying off both the lower interest balance and the higher interest balance on a proportional basis. 
   I want to say that this bill has gained not only 155 of my colleagues in a bipartisan sense, but it has also gained over 45 editorials from across this Nation in support of the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. I would like to share some of the comments from these editorials. 
   From the New York Times on May 3 of this year: `` ..... consumers are already losing as their interest rates on the cards suddenly skyrocket. Fees appear mysteriously on their bills, and even the billing cycles get shortened to make it harder to pay on time. Congress needs to take up the issue now rather than wait for the Federal Reserve to create rules that can be too easily changed. The banking industry likes to boast that more than 90 percent of credit card customers have no problems with their little plastic cards. Given that there are more than 1 billion credit cards believed to be in use, that leaves a lot of people swamped by what is now called the `tricks and traps' of the credit card business.'' 
   The Boston Globe reports on May 31: ``Regulators and elected officials are starting to circle the credit card companies and not a moment too soon. The Federal Reserve reports that credit card debt rose more than 7 percent last month on top of the already burdensome average of $8,000 per American family. Credit and debit card delinquencies are at their highest levels in 18 years, and all the while, credit card companies are employing practices that only dig consumers deeper and deeper into debt.'' 
   The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights is a modest reform to bar credit card companies from raising interest rates on outstanding balances because of some action or unpaid bill in another area. It deserves our support. 
   On May 6, USA Today reported: ``For years, Congress ignored consumer outrage as the industry flooded the public with solicitations, then squeezed customers with escalating fees and high rates. Voters should pay close attention this year to who is trying to get the issuers to act more responsibly and who is defending some of their more outrageous practices.'' 
   The Staten Island Advance on May 16 stated: ``In a sign that Americans are relying more on their credit cards, the total for revolving credit has grown in 2008 significantly faster than fixed-rate debt. During the past year, revolving debt has risen nearly $6 billion per month, or almost 8 percent, one of the fastest growth rates since 2001. In the past 12 years, penalty fees for late payments have more than doubled, from an average of $13 in 1995 to $28 now.  Make just one late payment, and you can face a penalty interest rate of more than 30 percent. The fine print in most disclosure statements says that issuers can change the terms of the cardholder's agreement at any time, for any reason. There is no other contract in the world that can change its terms at any time.'' 
   In Tennessee, the Knox News reports: ``The proposed regulations should curb some of the more unfair practices, and if effective, it may help consumers.'' 
   The St. Petersburg Times in Florida reports: 
   ``Americans owe more than $800 billion in credit card debt, and more than 1 in 3 cardholders are unable to make timely payment on accumulated balances. What is troublesome for banks can be tragic for families. With falling home values, stagnant wages and rising prices for basics such as food and fuel, Americans are relying more on credit cards to pay for necessities. Some lenders have taken advantage of that situation by bumping up fees and interest rates on credit cards, even for those who pay on time. Somebody needs to regulate a market that is out of control and takes advantage of the most naive and vulnerable consumers and is threatening an already fragile economy.'' 
   Then in Pennsylvania, on May 10, the Daily and Sunday Review stated: ``Intervention is necessary if Americans under the thumb of the credit card industry are to have any hope of solvency, and even though the Feds' proposals are welcomed, they should not supplant far broader relief envisioned in the credit card bill of rights.'' 
   The Charleston Gazette writes: ``Yes, too many accepted cards they could not afford, and charged more than they earned. As the old saying goes, `It's easier to sign a note than to pay for it.' However, tricking customers who carry a balance into paying dubious fees and penalties is unethical.'' 
   The Dallas Morning News says: ``There's a huge difference between charging cardholders who have missed payments and willfully creating a system to generate unnecessary penalties. We deserve change. We should pass change.'' 
   On May 6, the Baltimore Sun said: ``Amid a severe mortgage crisis and credit crunch, the rules should help prevent many cardholders from going under because of some of the industry's worst practices, including high interest rates and high fees. These proposals, which don't take effect until the end of the year, should not prevent Congress from acting on its own and passing needed credit card reform.'' 
   I would like to say that credit cards are important. They benefit many families, and I would say that some industry groups and some banks have instituted best practices and have said that they voluntarily will no longer impose any time/any reason increases on customers who pay on time and who don't go over their limits. They say they will no longer practice double cycle billing, but many credit card companies still practice these really harmful and unfair policies, so we need to pass this legislation, and we need to give relief to consumers and level the playing field, not only between the consumer and the cardholder but between companies that are doing the right thing and those that are still abusing the consumers. 
   I would like to say that I thank my colleagues. One hundred fifty-five of my colleagues have joined me on the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights and over 45 editorials from across this country. I hope that my colleagues will read the bill, those who are not on it, and will join us in this effort to bring relief to America's working families. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the President can no longer deny that the labor market is in recession. June was the sixth straight month of job losses, and this year the economy has lost over half a million jobs in the private sector. We have 8.5 million unemployed Americans, more than at any other time since 2003. 
   High prices for gasoline and food are squeezing workers' pay. Real wages were lower in June than they have been since September 2006. The recovery rebates have been boosting consumption, and millions will benefit from the extension of unemployment benefits signed into law last week. 
   Clearly, we must stem the tide of rising job losses. We need a second stimulus package of infrastructure development and fiscal relief for our States.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3001, the ``The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.'' This legislation gives critical assistance to our troops including providing equipment and training, providing all servicemembers with a pay raise of 3.9 percent, and improving health care. 
   I also want to note provisions in the bill based on legislation, H.R. 3033, the ``Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act,'' that I have been introducing since the 107th Congress to bring integrity back to the federal procurement system. S. 3001 will establish a comprehensive, centralized database that will keep track of the integrity and performance of certain persons awarded federal contracts and grants, more efficiently monitor the federal procurement system, and help protect U.S. taxpayer dollars. Any person awarded a federal agency contract or grant in excess of $500,000 would be included in the database including information related to any civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings involving the person. Currently, no central database exists to help procurement officials track fraudulent contractors who do business with the federal government. 
   As a City Councilwoman, I successfully led an effort to implement a similar system. This system has aided the City of New York tremendously, and it has prevented habitual bad actors and felons from being awarded city contracts. 
   Such a system is badly needed at the federal level. The contract officers and the federal government's watchdogs, the federal suspension and debarment officials, currently lack the information they need to protect our business interests. We have no central way of accounting for the performance of our purchases. Beyond a listing of currently debarred or suspended persons, officials are limited to their individual agency's knowledge of an entity's track record, press reports and personal contacts with other agencies. The American public's knowledge is limited even further. Often times this allows federal contractors and assistance recipients to repeatedly violate federal law yet still receive millions of dollars from the federal government. 
   The federal government spends more than $417 billion annually on goods and services. We owe it to the American people to be a model consumer. Today, we are taking an important step toward bringing greater transparency to the federal contracting process. 
   I want to thank Chairman WAXMAN, Ranking Member TOM DAVIS, Chairman TOWNS, and their staffs, particularly Mark Stephenson, for working with me on this issue. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of Senator MCCASKILL who championed the database provisions in the Senate as well as Representative MARK UDALL who joined me in support of a contracting reform amendment when the House considered the Defense Authorization legislation earlier this year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support S. 3001.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Smith amendment.  
   We have heard it so many times before, but the global gag rule is not about abortion. It is about women dying to the tune of 600,000 a year. That is equal to one or two jumbo jets crashing each day. The fact remains that, since 1973, no U.S. Federal funds have been or are being used around the world for abortions. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that they respect life, but during the time that we have been debating this bill, 65 women around the world will die from pregnancy because of many related complications; and they are dying because they do not have access to the most basic health care such as contraceptives. 
   I commend my colleague, Mrs. Lowey, for her commonsense approach to refining the global gag rule. Although I support a full repeal of the global gag rule, it would be unconstitutional in our country, and it is unconscionable that we are exporting it to the world's poorest women. 
   But the Lowey amendment merely allows NGOs and organizations to receive contraceptives, which are proven to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases. That is what it does. It is family planning. 
   So I ask my colleagues, what do we tell a Somalian mother whose teenage daughter has just died in childbirth? Do we explain there are some politicians in Washington who do not think that she deserves the same information and health care services that their own daughters have? 
   These programs are about saving women and girls' lives and helping both men and women get access to reproductive health services. So if you oppose abortion and oppose the spread of HIV/AIDS, it makes common sense, good sense to support access to contraceptives and oppose the Smith amendment. Support the Lowey provision.
