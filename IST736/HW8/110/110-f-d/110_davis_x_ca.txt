<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on H.R. 5749 to extend unemployment benefits to millions of American workers, including over 700,000 in my home State of California. And I'd like to speak about one of those real Americans that I am accountable to. 
   Just yesterday I spoke with a 51-year-old woman, whose name is Karen, from San Diego. After working for the past 10 years as a Consumer Service Specialist for a large telecom company, Karen was recently laid off from her job. And she's been actively looking for work but has been unable to find one because of the poor economy. 
   Unable to afford health insurance, the stress of being unemployed is beginning to take a toll on Karen's health. And it's also become harder and harder for her to pay her bills. She told me just looking for a job cost money because you've got to pay for the gas to drive to the interview. She can certainly relate to this discussion this morning. 
   To make matters worse, her unemployment benefits have just ended. She told me that she has worked hard her whole life and that she is not looking for a hand out, just her life back. 
   I think we can all agree Karen is one of those hardworking Americans we came to Washington to help.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUAL AS A NATIONAL TREASURE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the African American spiritual as a national treasure. From 1619 to 1865, enslaved African Americans created their own unique form of expression known today as spirituals. As African Americans were not allowed to speak their native languages or play African musical instruments, spirituals were incorporated into the English language and the Christian religious faith. These spirituals were the strong African oral tradition of songs, stories, proverbs and historical accounts. Spirituals have been a part of American culture from times of slavery to today, and their legacy is clear in today's gospel music. 
   Spirituals were also sung during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Songs that we are familiar with, such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and ``Marching 'Round Selma,'' were heard in the South to unite African Americans in the struggle for civil rights. 
   Some of the more commonly known songs, including ``Swing Low Sweet Chariot'' and ``The Gospel Train,'' used language which described religious activities but had a second meaning relating to the Underground Railroad. 
   Calvin Earl, a noted performer and educator of African American spirituals, stated that the lyrics used in spirituals became a metaphor for freedom from slavery, and they were a secret way for slaves to communicate with each other, teach their young, record their history and heal their pain. 
   Frederick Douglass, a fugitive slave who became one of the United States' leading abolitionists, stated that spirituals ``told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension'' and that ``every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.'' 
   This resolution is endorsed by the NAACP and the National Council of Negro Women, and I want to add my voice to theirs in support of helping to preserve a treasured, a really treasured piece of American history. 
   I urge my colleagues to resoundingly pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for winning the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship. 
   On December 16, 2006, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Huskers volleyball team won the 2006 NCAA Division I Championship by defeating the Stanford University Cardinals at the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to head coach John Cook, head assistant coach Lee Meas, assistant coach Charlene Johnson-Tagaloa, and the director of volleyball operations Lindsay Wischmeier. Also supporting the team was athletic director Steve Pederson and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln chancellor Harvey Perlman. 
   The Huskers, Mr. Speaker, had an exceptional record of 33-1 and had four All-Americans on their team. Junior Sarah Pavan also won the 2006-2007 Honda Sports Award. This award is given to the Nation's top collegiate female volleyball player. Pavan was also named the ESPN Magazine Academic All-American of the Year. 
   And I also want to extend my congratulations to the Stanford University Cardinals. The Cardinals had a record of 30-4. The Cardinals were the PAC-10 Conference champions and were honored by four women receiving All-American honors.     
   Student athletes, as we know, balance a rigorous school workload with the many practices and games in which they compete. 
   So I am proud of all the student athletes for their dedication to their school work and their sport. The NCAA promotes its 380,000 student athletes to work with numerous service organizations, including the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and the American Cancer Society. 
   Winning the national championship and finishing the season with a 33-1 record has brought positive national recognition and attention to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and I know that the fans of the university will cherish this moment as they look forward to the 2007 season. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for their success.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, the real issue here is about moving this Nation in the direction of energy independence. 
   It's true that this bill is about increasing royalties for oil extracted from land owned by the American people. 
   Lease agreements from 1998 and 1999 mistakenly did not include the proper royalty language. 
   As a result, the American people lost out on an estimated $865 million in royalties. 
   With this legislation, Congress has an opportunity, and a responsibility, to correct this mistake. 
   We also have an opportunity to roll back unnecessary subsidies and tax breaks for oil companies. 
   But the bill is not about sticking it to the oil industry as some critics have claimed. It is about creating an important funding mechanism for our Nation's energy future. 
   Throughout history, America has been an innovator in technology. 
   Benjamin Franklin's experiments with electricity paved the way toward harnessing its capabilities. 
   The Wright Brothers flew the first airplane. 
   America was the first to put a man on the moon. 
   Now is the time for America to become a leader in another field: renewable energy. 
   The funding generated from this bill will allow us to significantly increase our Nation's investment in renewable energy. 
   As a Nation, we have become more and more dependent on oil. We simply cannot maintain our current rate of oil consumption. 
   Madam Speaker, let's not wait until we hit rock bottom before making significant progress toward energy independence. 
   When it comes to renewable energy, we must go forward with the dedication and commitment that put America first in flight and put a man on the moon. 
   Let's show the American people that this Congress will set this Nation on the path toward clean, renewable energy.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our extraordinary troops and oppose sending over 20,000 additional U.S. forces into the middle of Iraq's violent sectarian conflict. I oppose the President's plan because it will not end the insurgency, halt military activity, or accelerate our departure from Iraq. The plan is not a strategic change. 
   Rather, it is the continuation of a failed policy. When Congress voted to authorize the use of military force, I voted ``no.'' I felt at that time that we had not exhausted all diplomatic avenues and that unilateral action would have a grave effect on our strategic position in the world. More significantly, it could undercut the broader long-term war against Islamic extremism. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, many of these predictions have come through. We now find ourselves in a position where only grim choices remain.     
   The war in Iraq has indeed strained our military, drained taxpayer dollars and damaged our credibility in the international community. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from a number of administration officials and academic experts on the way forward in Iraq. And many of these experts have warned against increasing the number of troops. 
   Last November, General Abizaid told Congress that an increase in U.S. troop levels would only delay the ability of Iraqis to take the lead. Mr. Speaker, what changed between November and today? Even the most ardent proponents of the troop increase acknowledge that to work all pieces must come together. 
   First, the military must be able to quell sectarian and insurgent violence. And then if the violence subsides long enough for a window of opportunity to open, the economic and political components must be executed flawlessly. 
   Even if our forces are successful in reducing violence in the short term, assurances cannot be given that other parts of the government will be able to address the economic and political components of the President's plan. 
   Well, the track record of the administration and the Maliki government make it hard to believe that such a plan will bring real results. One of the most egregious errors of our entire experience in Iraq has been the failure to put trained experts in critical civilian positions. 
   To accomplish this new mission, civilian agencies have been asked to send several hundred experts to Iraq to carry out the plan. However, the military has reported that because of hiring delays, DOD will have to assign their own personnel because U.S. civilian agencies are unable to fill the much needed positions. 
   Mr. Speaker, it should not be the role of the military to rebuild nations on their own. We should have been leveraging our talented and experienced Federal workforce all along. Many of my colleagues have already discussed key issues such as readiness and equipment levels, but two of the greatest concerns I have with the President's plan are the effect on our volunteer force and the strategic risk that is created by putting more military assets into Iraq. 
   By adding more troops, the administration leaves our Nation with fewer resources to deal with Afghanistan and future contingencies. Will we be able to respond if our military is needed elsewhere? With more of our troops bogged down, will our allies around the world continue to have faith in our ability to respond to extremist and military threats around the globe? 
   We must answer these questions. But I have not heard satisfactory responses from the President or military officials. Mr. Speaker, I also oppose the surge because the present administration has not sufficiently answered questions about the impact on military personnel. For those in the military, this war hits close to home every day. 
   While we have asked few Americans to sacrifice during this conflict, servicemembers and their families continue to face the uncertainty of repeated deployments, injury and in some cases the death of a loved one. They deserve better. 
   Mr. Speaker, I told President Bush that veterans in my district have said, ``We are a military at war, not a Nation at war.'' And military leaders agree. Mr. Speaker, if we truly want to create a situation where we can withdraw our troops, we need to escalate our diplomatic efforts and call on Iraq's neighbors to help the Iraqi Government make the tough political decisions needed to reduce the violence. 
   We must not give in to the President's diversion, but develop a multipronged strategic plan the American and the Iraqi people deserve

   I really want to thank a number of my families in my district in San Diego who shared their stories with me and gave me this opportunity to help make a change in this legislation. And the second I believe has already been mentioned, and that removes a date of service requirement, preventing those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to fully take advantage of the federally supported Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bond program.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 25th anniversary of Dr. Sally K. Ride's historic journey as the first American woman in space. 
   Dr. Ride also happens to be one of my constituents, and I have had the pleasure of meeting her. Twenty-five years ago, Dr. Ride and the STS-7 crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger were propelled into space. It had been over two decades since Neil Armstrong took one giant leap for mankind. But on June 18, 1983, Sally K. Ride took a large stride for women everywhere by becoming the first American woman in space. 
   A gifted athlete, Dr. Ride had opted out of a promising tennis career to pursue college degrees in physics and English at Stanford University. 
   In 1977, Dr. Ride's interest was piqued by a NASA announcement seeking young scientists to serve as mission specialists on shuttle flights. Hers would be the first NASA class ever to accept women. 
   Out of thousands of applications, NASA selected Dr. Ride to be one of six women out of 35 new astronauts, and the class became known as the ``35 New Guys.'' 
   To be sure, Mr. Speaker, on her historic space mission, Dr. Ride wasn't simply along for the ride. She was the mission's flight engineer, tested a robotic arm which deployed and retrieved satellites, and assisted the commander and pilot during flight. 
   Six years later, Dr. Ride flew into space again. Her experience and success earned her the respect of our Nation and her colleagues. 
   In 1986, she was asked to served on the Presidential Commission investigating the tragic Challenger explosion. Dr. Ride left her position at NASA in 1987, but has never stopped inspiring and encouraging the next generation to explore the world of science and space. Her impact on young women has been particularly profound. 
   She is a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego and director of the University of California's California Space Institute. And she has also founded her own company, Sally Ride Science, which encourages students and their parents and teachers to learn about and enjoy the field of science. And I know from personal experience that at the science and math fairs, she is the hit. She is the highlight, and all of the young people really line up to talk with her. 
   Capturing the essence of Dr. Ride's life work, her company's motto is ``All Science, All the Time.'' 
   It is this undying dedication to her field and to informing and inspiring young people that has been so characteristic of Dr. Ride since her barrier-breaking space mission a quarter of a century ago. With women like her leading the way, it is no wonder that the number of females to obtain degrees in science and engineering has increased dramatically in the last 30 years. 
   Ensuring that women are equitably represented in science and technology fields will mean a new level of global competitiveness for our country. This is something we need as we continue to fall behind as a Nation in math and the sciences. 
   While Dr. Ride's mission landed safely 25 years ago, the task of achieving gender parity in her field is far from over. 
   As Dr. Ride's Congresswoman and as the grandmother to a young and curious granddaughter, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I want to thank my colleagues from Virginia for having this time set aside for all of us to come to the floor today and express our real sadness in losing our friend, JO ANN DAVIS. 
   Mr. Speaker, in many ways JO ANN was not just my friend, but in some ways my sister here. I came to the Congress in 2001 with JO ANN; and at the beginning, because our names are the same, we got a little confused. In fact, people confused one particular bill with our names, and it took us awhile to sort that out. We had a good laugh over that because sometimes we didn't always agree on everything. 
   But I can say that of so many people that I have met and had a chance to spend time with, I really enjoyed my time with JO ANN. She was just such a strong woman who didn't always have an easy time, particularly as we saw her suffer through cancer. 
   But she was so desirous, I think, of telling people a little bit about how she was doing and yet at the same time letting us know that she was okay. Well, you know, she wasn't always okay, but she wanted us to know that. 
   The first experience that I had with JO ANN is when we had an opportunity to travel to Afghanistan together, and one of the first codels, soon after we had a chance to go in and see how our military was doing there, and what was happening and trying to help develop the new Afghani Army. 
   We had quite an amazing trip. In spending all that time in the air and on the ground and really having a chance to talk, I felt like I got to know her as a true individual with great values, connected with family, and someone who was so devoted to her community. We both represent a military community, and I think we shared a great deal of that together. 
   I wanted to just say thank you for what JO ANN gave me over these last years and helping me to also talk about my values and what is important to me. Family was very important to her. My husband and I reach out to Chuck and the family, and we wish them all the condolences in the world that we can bring to them and thank them for being the wonderful family that they are.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 66, which authorizes the use of the Capitol rotunda for a ceremony on April 19, 2007, commemorating the victims of the Holocaust. 
   The United States Holocaust Memorial Council is entrusted with observing the Days of Remembrance. These Days of Remembrance and the solemn ceremony at the Capitol set the manner in which similar events across our country pay homage to the 6 million people who lost their lives during one of mankind's darkest periods in history. 
   When World War II ended in 1945, 6 million European Jews were dead, including more than 1 million Jewish children. While all Jews were marked for death, children were among the most defenseless. 
   This year, the Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and organizes the annual Days of Remembrance, has selected ``Children in Crisis: Voices from the Holocaust'' as its theme. 
   In any day and age, among the most vulnerable targets are children, and most often they are the first victims of senseless deeds. The children of the Holocaust endured lives filled with fear and suffering. The emotional and physical cruelty forced upon them is unimaginable. It is estimated that over 1 million, and as many as 1.5 million, Jewish boys and girls were murdered under Nazi rule in Germany and occupied Europe. These children were murdered because they were Jewish, not because of any action they had taken; not because of any crime they had committed, but simply because of their religion and their ethnicity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that a number of the Members have been to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, and I have an enduring image there of the children, the stars which represent them, the luminaries which hang from the ceiling, those tens of thousands of luminaries which remind us all of this overwhelming reason for us to remember these children. 
   Many children of the Holocaust were confronted by overpowering and destructive forces, separated from their parents and coerced into hiding. Children who found themselves hiding in the shadows were faced with unyielding hardships, and some were subjected to dark, cramped conditions for weeks, for months and even years, while others wandered from place to place seeking refuge, never knowing who to trust. 
   For those who survived, the end of the war was rarely the end of the struggle. Many children found themselves alone, with no family to be reunited with. The devastating and heart-wrenching reality was that there were no surviving family members, and they would now face the future without parents, grandparents or siblings. 
   So, as we stop to reflect on this heinous event, let it serve as a reminder that there is no room for prejudice, oppression and hatred. As American and world citizens, it is important that succeeding generations are called upon to remember the atrocities of the Holocaust and the similarities in the hate crimes we see today. 
   The will of the human spirit indeed is unwavering in the face of adversity, and history has shown us that in times of despair, humanity prevails and always looks towards a brighter future. 
   There is no better place than the United States Capitol rotunda to embody the reverence and dignity so deserving and honoring the victims of the Holocaust, especially the children. The United States Capitol has stood as a symbol of freedom and liberty and a symbol of hopes and dreams. 
   It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we use the rotunda, the scene of so many historic events, to draw attention again to one of the immense tragedies in human history and to take this time also to honor our colleagues who were personally victimized by the Holocaust or whose families suffered and died, and to pledge anew that such a atrocities must not be permitted to occur. We recall the words, ``never again, never again.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support, but I am sorry we are not debating a more inclusive gender identity bill today, which I would have supported, and let me tell you why. 
   Employment discrimination strikes at a fundamental American value, the right of each individual to do his or her job without facing unfair discrimination. Transgendered people are among the most marginalized and vulnerable groups within the LGBT community. 
   I worked with a nationally known landscape architect as a member of the San Diego School Board that San Diegans know today as Vicki Estrada. Vicki Estrada spent the first 50 years of her life as Steve Estrada. Soon after Steve became Vicki, she was assured by a leader within the California Department of Transportation, where Vicki worked as a contractor, that she would be treated no differently. 
   Vicki had only a few problems with her transition, for two reasons: She had an internal advocate and the comprehensive protection of California State law. Others, Madam Chairman, are not so lucky, which is why it is so important for us to provide inclusive Federal protections. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in continued support of the entire LGBT community, and I also urge them to join me in supporting this bill.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I worked as a social worker before my career in public office, and I've seen firsthand the results when mental illnesses go untreated. Those who develop a severe mental illness can go from having a career and a family to losing everything. 
   About half our States now have implemented full mental health parity requirements, and these States have learned a very valuable lesson. They've learned that the benefits of ensuring parity are worthwhile.     
   Far too many people's illnesses, mental illnesses, linger without treatment, triggering physical complications that only result in more costs. So, proper diagnosis and treatment greatly offset these costs and save health care dollars over the long term. 
   This bill will also help our servicemembers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as they transition to civilian life because national barriers to mental health care ripple out to everyone. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other combat-related conditions can take months, if not years, to develop after discharge. Many of these veterans will not have access to VA health facilities and will rely upon private health insurance to obtain treatment. 
   Finally, and most importantly, this legislation also addresses the stigma  attached to mental health care. It loudly communicates that mental health care is on an equal footing with physical health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I give my enthusiastic support to the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. I thank the sponsors and encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for it today.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1084. In today's security environment, it is absolutely essential that we authorize the creation of the Response Readiness Corps and Response Readiness Reserve within the State Department and USAID. This legislation is a vital step toward achieving a proper balance between civilian and military efforts in stabilization and reconstruction missions. 
   Iraq and Afghanistan have really highlighted a need for better interagency coordination and a more robust civilian capacity. As someone who went to Iraq early and saw a void of adequate civilian support, I know that we need to improve the civilian apparatus for future stability in reconstruction efforts. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we have relied on the military to act as diplomats, help build government capacity and conduct combat missions, all at the same time. 
   Simply put, stability and reconstruction have fallen too heavily on our military in recent years. Unable to tap into a viable, full-scale deployable civilian force, our great men and women have been asked to perform jobs outside of their area of expertise. Congress must, must do a better job of marshalling all elements of national power in support of U.S. goals abroad and ensure that future missions are not military-centric, but joint interagency efforts. Part of this effort must be greater capacity within civilian agencies, a bench to pull from when contingencies arise. This legislation by my friend from California will help do just that. 
   Congress must also be thinking about how to capture the skills and lessons learned from military personnel and civilians who have served on PRTs or other interagency projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. These individuals now have vital skills that could be used to help train Federal civilian employees deploying to zones of conflict. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1084 gets us on the right path, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for including provisions from H.R. 337 and H.R. 515 in the HEART Act. Including these two bills is particularly meaningful for me because both were inspired by servicemembers and veterans in my district who came to me and said we have problems needing your attention. 
   The first bill addresses a harmful glitch in the Supplemental Security Income program. Because eligibility for SSI benefits is based on income, a family struggling to get by actually loses benefits for their children from any increase in military pay considered ``unearned income.'' Military families do not deserve to lose the benefits they badly need because a parent chooses to serve in the Armed Forces. 
   The second bill fixes a serious flaw in the CalVet Home Loan program limiting eligibility to servicemembers who signed up prior to 1977. This prevents many veterans from the first Gulf War and nearly all veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from taking advantage of the CalVet program. H.R. 6081 removes the date of service provision, giving servicemembers retiring in California a greater opportunity to own a home.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (HONORING WOMEN IN THE ARMED FORCES AND FEMALE VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Every time I visit military installations, at home and abroad, I'm constantly impressed by the tremendous job our servicemembers are doing, and I'm particularly impressed by our  brave servicewomen, whom I seek out at every chance. 
   Over 350,000 American women are currently serving in our Armed Forces, following in the footsteps of women who have voluntarily served in every military conflict in United States history since the Revolutionary War. 
   During the revolution, women served on the front lines as nurses, water bearers and even saboteurs. For years, women had to disguise themselves as men in order to enlist in our military. Although the Army and Navy Nurse Corps were established in the early 1900s, it was not until the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 that women were granted permanent status in the regular and Reserve Armed Forces. 
   As Memorial Day approaches, we should recognize that our servicewomen play an increasingly important role in America's military forces. Women serving in the Armed Forces make up approximately 15 percent of active duty personnel, 15 percent of Reserves and 17 percent of the National Guard. 
   Women are flying helicopters and fighter aircraft. They are saving lives as nurses and doctors, and they are driving support vehicles and policing perimeters. 
   Servicewomen are also receiving recognition of their service, including awards for valor. Most recently, Private First Class Monica Lin Brown became only the second woman since World War II to receive the Silver Star, our Nation's third highest medal for valor, for her service in Afghanistan. The first woman since World War II to receive this honor was Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester, who received the Silver Star in 2005 for her service in Iraq. 
   When I visit installations, I am so grateful for the response and insight I receive from women in the Armed Forces. They are adamant they do not want to be treated differently; yet they would like us to understand and recognize the additional burdens that are inherent in the many roles they play as wives, as mothers and caretakers. 
   Later this week, the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues will host its annual ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery to honor our Nation's servicewomen and women veterans and to remember women who have died while on duty serving the United States. 
   As Chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel and co-Chair of the Women's Caucus Task Force on Women in the Military and Veterans, I'm privileged to honor the legacy of servicewomen in the past, the courage with which women serve today, and the enthusiasm inherent in the young women who dream of serving this great Nation in the future. 
   Part of honoring them is asking the tough questions about the expanding roles our servicewomen are taking on and excelling in. We hear from women in the military in person and through the media about their contributions in combat zones and their willingness to risk their lives in defense of their fellow servicemembers, our country and our families. These are issues we should recognize and address. They deserve nothing less. 
   We should never fail to remember the sacrifices our servicewomen and their families make to keep our families safe. 
   This resolution honors the service and achievements of women in the military and women veterans and encourages all people in the United States to do the same and to learn more about these wonderful accomplishments. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to have offered this resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a distinguished former Member of this body. 
   On Sunday, May 18, the San Diego community was grieved to learn of Lionel Van Deerlin's passing. He was a Member of the House for 18 years, between 1962 and 1980, having served the San Diego region honorably, and with a tenacious spirit and the purest sense of loyalty to his constituents. 
   Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin, who liked to be called simply Van, was equally respected on both sides of the aisle, well known for his grace, civility and humor that he brought to any debate. 
   As the chairman of the House Communications Subcommittee at the time, Representative Van Deerlin was a pivotal player in positively transforming our Nation's telecommunications industry. 
   Before and after his days in the House, Congressman Van Deerlin had a distinguished career in journalism and education. Even at 93 years old, Van was a regular commentator to the San Diego Union Tribune, passionately observing both local and national politics with a keen wit. I remember reading his final column last Tuesday, and was awaiting his next, as I always did. 
   He was unfailingly optimistic, always present with a sparkle in his eye and a smile on his face. This consummate gentleman will be deeply missed by his family, his friends, his colleagues, and certainly the entire San Diego community. 
   I yield to my colleague from San Diego, Mr. Hunter.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 961, commending the Alaska Army National Guard for its service to the State of Alaska and the citizens of the United States. 
   Let me first take a moment to thank Representative Don Young of Alaska for taking the lead and getting this resolution to the floor here today.  
   The 297th Infantry and the scout group of the Alaska Army National Guard's deployment of almost 600 Alaskans was the largest deployment of the Alaska National Guard since World War II. 
   The deployment of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry included servicemembers from 80 different communities across Alaska, and included 75 soldiers from New York, Mississippi, Illinois, Georgia and Puerto Rico. 
   The term ``citizen soldier'' is a term that rings true for these patriots that have stepped forward to serve our great country. 
   Five hundred eighty-six servicemembers of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry were mobilized in July of 2006 and deployed to Camp Shelby, Mississippi. The 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry was deployed to Camp Virginia, Camp Navstar, and Camp Buehring in northern Kuwait where they courageously performed route and perimeter security missions, mounted combat patrols and inspections and searches of vehicles going into Iraq from Kuwait. 
   Over the course of 12 months in Kuwait and Iraq, they inspected and searched over 30,000 semi-trucks and designed all force protection plans in northern Kuwait. 
   We would like to thank the families of these servicemembers who have provided unwavering support while waiting for their loved ones to return. It is through the support of our families that our servicemembers are able to serve our great Nation, especially during times of war. 
   In addition, when members of the National Guard deploy, their families are not the only ones affected. Since our servicemembers live and work in their communities, the communities, too, are affected by these deployments, especially their employers. We would like to recognize and thank those employers who have displayed patriotism over profit by keeping positions saved for the returning soldiers and supporting the soldier's families during this time. Our soldiers and their families could not have made it through these difficult times without that support. 
   The courageousness and dedication to duty of the members of the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry is evident in the awards and decorations received during their deployment, which included three Bronze Stars, 12 Meritorious Service Medals, 142 Army commendations, and more than 200 Army Achievement Medals for their outstanding service. 
   As a Nation, we thank you for your service to the Commonwealth of Alaska and the citizens of the United States upon completion of this deployment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume 
   I rise today to urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 986 which recognizes members of the Armed Forces who were held as prisoners of war during the Vietnam conflict, and calls for a full accounting of the 1,729 members who still remain unaccounted for from that conflict. 
   ``Never leave a comrade behind'' is the motto of our Armed Forces. However, one of the regrettable results of war is the possibility of being forced to leave behind missing personnel or prisoners of war. 
   At the conclusion of the Vietnam War, 2,646 members of the Armed Forces were considered prisoners of war or were declared missing in action. While many servicemembers were returned, 1,729 of our soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines remain unaccounted for to this very day. 
   During the course of the Vietnam War, as many as 700 American military personnel were held by the enemy. One of the infamous prison facilities in Vietnam was referred to as the ``Hanoi Hilton.'' Located in downtown Hanoi, the prison held American servicemembers including then Lieutenant Commander John McCain, now  Senator McCain, and another of our esteemed colleagues, former Major Samuel R. Johnson. Sam Johnson was shot down April 16, 1966, as he flew his 25th Air Force mission over Vietnam. 
   Bravery and passion filled the hearts of our servicemembers in Vietnam who willingly gave their life and liberty to protect the rights that Americans hold dear. We honor the sacrifice of those who gave their lives in defense of our Nation, and to those who were prisoners of war as they epitomize the very best of America. 
   For nearly 7 years, Mr. Johnson and 700 servicemembers endured beatings, torture tactics, starvation, denial of medical attention and denial of contact to the outside world. January 27, 1973, marked the beginning of Operation Homecoming, the mission to end the brutal mistreatment of American troops following the cease-fire agreement between the United States and North Vietnam. Operation Homecoming concluded on April 1, 1973, when the last of 591 prisoners of war were released. However, it is clear that much work remains to be done in finding the 1,729 troops who did not return home. 
   Since 1985, the Vietnamese Government has been working with the United States to help return our servicemembers back to their families, and we appreciate their efforts, and ask them to renew their efforts to help us bring these Americans home. 
   On behalf of the American people, our deep appreciation and heartfelt thanks go to the prisoners of war from Vietnam and other conflicts and to their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in support of this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I stand before you and my colleagues today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 32, honoring members of the United States Air Force who were wounded and killed in the June 25, 1996 terrorist bombing of the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 
   The June blast took the lives of 19 airmen from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and destroyed the entire front of Dhahran's Khobar Towers housing compound. More than 500 U.S. Air Force troops were wounded, and 297 Middle Eastern citizens were killed or injured as a result of the bombing. Five thousand pounds of plastic explosives disguised in a water tanker truck claimed the lives of servicemembers whose families were left grieving the loss of their loved ones. 
   Life, our most treasured asset, is too often taken unexpectedly. It was the sworn duty of our airmen to protect and serve this country by all means, and in our commitment to them and others who have given their lives in defense of our great Nation, we honor their selfless sacrifice and take a moment to reflect upon their contribution that provides us the freedoms we enjoy today. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 32 extends our sympathies to the families of loved ones whose perpetrators have yet been brought to justice. 
   Although this tragedy acknowledges the cost we pay in our fight against terrorism, we remain proud of our courageous and steadfast troops who are no doubt the best in the world. We call upon every American today to pause and pay tribute to the brave airmen who died, and to take a moment to thank our members of the Armed Forces currently serving around the world and express our appreciation for their duty and honor to protect America's interests around the world. 
   This resolution recognizes the service and sacrifice of those airmen whose lives were lost on that fateful day. I strongly urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 32 in remembrance of the 19 fallen heroes on the 12th anniversary of the Dhahran terrorist bombing. 
   I thank my good friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Miller) for bringing forward this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   That is why I am urging the chairman and the Congress to work with the Treasury and the SEC to promulgate rules on accounting practices that reflect the true value of assets they will be working with. 
   This bill is not a magic bullet but the cost of doing nothing may be far greater than the painful steps we take today.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (EFFECTS OF TROOP DEPLOYMENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
   Mr. Speaker, I really am delighted to join my colleagues here and to hear the warm stories that they've told and how critical, how important the issue that we're speaking about this evening is because, you know, what is it about? It's really about our national security, and it is about the willingness of men and women to serve. 
   I found a quote from our first Commander in Chief, President Washington, and I think it's appropriate to what we've been talking about here today because he said that ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by our nation.'' 
   And I would add to what President Washington said that the willingness with which our families are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive families of early wars were treated and appreciated by our Nation. 
   When I first came to Congress and I found this fabulous opportunity to serve on the Armed Services Committee, we were not at war. And I met with many of our families and our ombudspeople in the Navy and began to understand what they go through. And I remember so strongly that one of the spouses, one of the ombudsmen said to me, You know, people think of our husbands who deploy on ships, obviously, in the Navy. But, you know, all of us prepare and deploy, that families prepare for this. She was talking about a time when we are not at war. 
   So we can imagine how difficult it is for families who are preparing for that deployment, preparing for the kind of uncertainties that they know will be around the corner. And that's so difficult. 
   You have the picture of the family here and the children, and I look at the faces of the children; and I see such resilience in their eyes, and children are tremendously resilient. But the reality is that our children who go to school, and most of our children go to regular schools; they don't go to schools where there are only military families, and on some of our bases that's true, but I have learned on many of our bases that most of the families are in public schools out in the community. 
   Many of those children come to school with great fears of what is going to happen that day. They don't know if Mommy and Daddy are even going to come home, those who are a little more sophisticated about what they are going through. So we have to be very, very careful, be very, very supportive of those families. 
   We can even think about our own struggles at home, our own struggles with financial issues and just the general stuff that any couples go through and then magnify that for our families. Many of our families are very young, and we especially need to be supportive of them. 
   We've covered a lot of ground here this evening, so I don't want to have to go over some of that ground. But if we're going to deploy our men and women at the current pace that we're doing today, we really have to understand the consequences of our policy decisions and sufficiently address how they affect the brave men and women who are serving. 
   And there is one area that I think the public is learning more about now. And the other day, I had a few hours, and I decided that I didn't have anybody to go with at the time but I wanted to just go see the movie Stop-Loss. And I wanted to just sit in that theater by myself and feel the full impact of that movie because there is a policy involved there that we have undertaken. And I think when you go and you see the movie, and I would certainly encourage people to do that to understand the pain that our families go through, how unpredictable it is and how difficult it is. 
   We have been looking at this policy, of course, and we would like to stop it. But we know that in fact we need the men and women serving today. So as much as we want to stop that, we're not able to do that right away. Stop-loss, as we know, allows the military to extend a servicemember's time in uniform, and it has been used far too often, and there have been some attempts to change that. We also know, very significantly, predictability is so important to our men and women who serve, and the repeated deployments make that very, very difficult. 
   So I think we need to focus, and we are, on the dwell-time that families have. They need to readjust. I have had spouses tell me that now that they've been through so many deployments, they're beginning to teach other families about how to give their loved ones space because when you come home, the family wants to just be right there. Well, sometimes that doesn't work so well, and people need to learn that. 
   So I think that with many of the policies that we're working on today, and yes, we are learning more; we're learning more about PTSD, we're learning about how we can erase the stigma, and I think the military can actually lead the way for the country in that if we do it right. 
   So I just want to commend you for having this time today and let you know that we are working hard on this. I wish we could work a lot faster on these issues. But we are trying very hard and keeping in mind every day our wonderful men and women who are serving and their families. They are the ones who are sacrificing today, and we need to give them every support that we can.

   Senate Concurrent Resolution 68 authorizes advanced planning for the use of the Capitol rotunda on January 20, 2009, for the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President and Vice President of the United States. Congress traditionally passes this measure in the year prior to the event in order to begin security planning and rehearsal for the inaugural, since the rotunda is routinely used for ceremonial purposes during the inauguration and could host the event, itself, depending on the weather at that time. 
   Senate Concurrent Resolution 68 does not formally authorize use of the rotunda for the inaugural events, themselves, since it will expire on January 3, 2009, like all concurrent resolutions which are not made part of permanent law, and must be renewed in the 111th Congress. However, action today will initiate the period of pre-event planning necessary to bring one of our democracy's most memorable and historic ceremonies to fruition smoothly and safely. 
   I urge passage of the Senate concurrent resolution.

   Our servicemembers face extraordinary challenges when activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan while in college. 
   Under current law, those deciding not to return to school must begin to repay the loan immediately after returning home, and this means, as we all know, that they will receive their student loan bills in the mail within days of returning from a combat zone. 
   Among the other benefits in this bill, the College Cost Reduction Act includes an amendment to give those activated while in college a 13-month deferment before they must begin repaying a student loan. 
   This bill is important, and it's important for this reason, because it provides our servicemembers the protections and the rights they deserve when activated while in college.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act of 2007. This legislation makes college more affordable and higher education more accessible for all Americans. But the bill, as we know, will do much more than help Americans make it to college. As we know, graduates today often spend years paying off their loans. 
   This fall, a young woman named Amy wrote to me and explained the challenges her family faces. Their income is over $60,000 a year. She pays $700 a month in student loans. I am an attorney, she wrote, and my student loans are killing me. Without help, I risk never buying a home or being able to save for retirement. 
   By reducing interest rates, those who graduate from college will save more than $4,500 over the life of their loan. Lower interest rates also mean that college graduates will have more money to contribute to the economy, start innovative businesses, that kind of competition we talked about, and save for their retirements. Do we really want to discourage our young people from taking the kinds of career risks that bring a benefit to society? 
   This Congress has an opportunity to help a new generation become engineers, doctors, business leaders, teachers, public servants, or whatever they dream of becoming. So let us not shackle young adults with spiraling debt just as they reach independence. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I rise in support of the Skelton-Berman-Lowey amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted why Congress and the executive branch must do a better job of marshalling all elements of national power in support of U.S. goals abroad and ensure that future missions are not military-centric but joint interagency efforts. 
   The creation of an interagency advisory panel required to make recommendations to each department is an excellent first step. 
   As important as the creation of this new panel is, the coordination between the committees that we see here today is also critical. 
   We know that part of the interagency problem is the rigid stovepipe structure found right here in this body. So while this amendment seeks to influence the executive branch, it will take reforms on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to have the type of interagency coordination we need to address the challenges of the 21st century. 
   I applaud the sponsors of this bill, Chairman Skelton, Chairman Berman and Chairwoman Lowey. They deserve an enormous amount of credit for bringing this forward, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

The barriers to mental health care are really playing themselves out today because I just talked to a family just a little while ago, and they felt that even though we're starting to put in some of those services, there's great resistance to people seeking that kind of care. 
   This bill begins to change that. It sends a very clear and a very direct message that mental health care is as important as physical care. We wouldn't stop people in the middle of their treatment for something of stomach ulcers. You cannot stop people in the middle of their treatment for mental health disorders. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased this bill is on the floor.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (PURPLE HEART FAMILY EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was honored for the opportunity to introduce the Purple Heart Equity Act along with Representative VIRGINIA FOXX, Minority Whip ROY BLUNT, Chairman JOHN MURTHA, and a number of other bipartisan sponsors. We came together, and this is a unanimous bill because honoring the women who have won the Purple Heart is something that we can all stand behind. 
   As commander of the Continental Army, as has been mentioned, George Washington wanted to recognize soldiers whose sacrifices and distinction forwarded the cause of independence. As a result, he created the Military Merit. He also designed the award, shaped it like a heart in the color purple. And after the Revolutionary War, this award was actually abandoned. But in honor of the bicentennial of Washington's birth, President Herbert Hoover revived the award in 1932, and it maintained its original design and became more known today, of course, as the Purple Heart. 
   In that same year the Military Order of the Purple Heart formed with the mission of fostering a positive environment among wounded veterans as well as providing services to all veterans and their families. But when the organization was federally chartered in 1958, few women actually had won the Purple Heart. So, under the current law, male members today can invite their wives to join the Ladies Auxiliary of the Purple Heart, but there is no place in this organization for the husbands of female members. 
   So that's why H.R. 1119 is important today, because it adds the word ``spouses'' to the Federal Charter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart. And with this small update, the husbands of female members will have the option of joining the organization just as the wives do. 
   Just a little bit more history, Mr. Speaker. The first woman to be awarded the Purple Heart was Lieutenant Annie G. Fox after she was killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Since then, the Military Order of the Purple Heart has identified at least 97 female Purple Heart recipients who have joined the organization. 
   It has been 66 years since Lieutenant Fox earned the award, and now it is time, certainly time, that we act to fully honor the courageous women who are bestowed with the Purple Heart. H.R. 1119 honors and recognizes these brave women and future recipients of the Purple Heart. This is the least, certainly, we can do for the women who sacrifice for our country. 
   And, finally, H.R. 1119 will allow the siblings of all who belong to the organization to join as associate members. 
   By passing this legislation today, we certainly honor every family whose son or daughter or sister or brother has won the distinguished Purple Heart.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues from the Ways and Means Committee for including provisions from H.R. 337 and H.R. 551 in the HEART Act. These are two important bills that I have been championing since I came to Congress. 
   The first bill addresses a glitch in the SSI program. Because eligibility for SSI benefits is based on a family's income, military families lose benefits when additional pay is added to their income. A military family struggling to make ends meet loses benefits for their children if they receive jump pay, hazardous duty pay or a number of other pays considered ``unearned income.'' I think I speak for my colleagues when I say these pays are not unearned but hard earned. 
   The second bill addresses qualified veterans mortgage bonds. And as a Californian, I join with other colleagues in the desire to provide veterans who signed up for service after 1977 with a better opportunity to achieve homeownership. Why should a veteran who served in Iraq be treated any differently than somebody who signed up before 1977? Correcting this flaw in current law will allow those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to have  great opportunities towards owning a home in California's high-cost real estate market.

   Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago, President Harry Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces. Determined to end segregation in the Armed Forces, President Truman issued this historic directive to end discrimination experienced by African American soldiers. 
   Executive Order 9981 was successful in ending racial segregation in the military and its effect is long-standing. As a result of the directive, segregation based on creed, gender, and national origin was also abolished. It is important we recognize such an historic victory for civil rights and for our Armed Forces.

   The anniversary marks the 40th year that the ancient and historic city has been administered as a unified city in which the rights of all faiths have been respected. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that having worked in Jerusalem in 1965, I experienced that time when in fact people could not travel to all of Jerusalem, and in fact we know that that is very different today. 
   It is also important that we use this anniversary to highlight the work that still needs to be done. The historic victory by the Israeli military greatly expanded Israel's territory, but with territorial gains came new problems. These unresolved issues have led to ever-increasing tensions that today manifest themselves in the form of Qassam rocket attacks and military insurgents. As we debate this resolution today, the region, as we know, finds itself in dire conflict. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced a resolution calling on President Bush to dispatch a new special envoy to the Middle East to capitalize on every opportunity for progress. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States must be the leader in promoting peace. The current situation is simply unsustainable. So as we look back 40 years today, let us also look 40 years ahead. Let us look 40 years ahead and work toward a future, not fraught with conflict and strife, but coexistence, moderation and understanding.

   Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and privilege that I rise in support of House Resolution 1464 in commemoration and recognition of the AARP's 50th anniversary. 
   In what started as a campaign to obtain affordable health care for retired teachers, AARP founder, Ethel Percy Andrus, began a movement dedicated to serving and advocating for its nearly 40 million members and all Americans over the age of 50. For the past 50 years, the AARP has advocated tirelessly to address the needs of the elderly, contributing immensely to the greater well-being of some of our most vulnerable citizens. 
   During this time, the AARP has also provided trusted research and information that continues to shape public policy. This national organization exemplifies the ideals of service and advocacy, and has been a tremendous force in enhancing opportunities for older Americans in their search for quality health care, pension and retirement security, financial and overall well-being. 
   In addition, I would also like to thank and congratulate AARP's CEO, Bill Novelli and the countless volunteers and staff for their leadership and commitment to furthering the organization's mission of a healthy and secure elderly population in the United States. I would like to extend my congratulations and appreciation to the AARP for their exceptional dedication and service, and I wish this organization continued success in years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6890 which will aid schools affected by Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Katrina, and Rita in addition to those impacted by this summer's flooding in the Midwest. 
   This August marked the third year since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the gulf coast. People lost their homes, their livelihoods, and their family members. Entire towns were leveled and cities emptied. While in the past 3 years, the affected States have made great strides towards normalcy, many school districts, many school districts still struggle to deal with the loss of students, teachers, facilities, and funding. 
   And only a few weeks ago, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit the still-recovering region causing an incredible amount of damage to its communities, the extent of which has yet to be fully realized. Many students are not yet back in their homes. Many schools were destroyed by the storms or by flooding. Many teachers have not yet returned, and much of the affected States' resources have gone to addressing other recovery needs. 
   It is not surprising that as a result of storms like these, school budgets are stretched thin and students' education suffers. 
   As part of the Hurricane Education Recovery Act of 2005, Congress granted the Secretary of Education the authority to waive several requirements in order to ease fiscal burdens on the States where a major disaster had been declared. These provisions have proved useful to all States affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas all applying for and receiving waivers. 
   This bill extends the waivers allowing Restart programs to be more flexible with their fiscal resources. It will allow schools in the affected regions to continue on their road to recovery by devoting funds to their most pressing needs so that they can better serve students who have been through so much in the past few years. 
   This bill also guarantees that schools affected by the most recent storms and flooding will maintain the same level of funding under Federal grant programs in the 2009 and 2010 school year as they received for the current school year. By allowing school districts to maintain their previous level of funding for the next year, this provision allows them to rebuild and prepare for the return of their students without having to deal with the additional challenge of reduced resources. 
   It reassures families that when they do return to their homes, their children's education will not suffer. By bringing students and families back to the region, it's an important step in helping those devastated areas recover and become vibrant communities once more. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge the adoption of H.R. 6890. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 642, the College Fire Prevention Act. This legislation is the result of the life work of the late Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Many of us know the commitment of Representative Tubbs Jones to the cause of campus fire safety. Every September, she would come to the floor to advocate for the recognition of September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Because of her efforts, States around the country also recognized September as Campus Fire Safety Month and helped to make students aware of the dangers they face and to ensure that colleges and universities do all they can to assist students. 
   H.R. 642 builds on Representative Tubbs Jones' work to protect students on campus by creating a demonstration program within the Department of Education to encourage colleges and universities to install fire sprinkler systems and other fire suppression and prevention technologies in student housing and dormitories. 
   I can think of no better time to talk about campus fire safety than now, when our students are returning to schools. We all know that in the hustle and bustle of moving in and getting ready for class, thoughts of whether one is prepared for a fire can sometimes get lost. 
   Historically, August and September are two of the most fatal months for campus fires. We can assist institutions in avoiding these preventable tragedies by encouraging colleges and universities to educate students about fire safety before they arrive on campus. 
   In passing this legislation here today, we not only honor the work of Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones, but we also ensure the safety of students on campus. 
   I urge the passage of this timely and important legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the benefits of service learning as a teaching strategy and to support the goals of the National Learn and Serve Challenge. 
   Service learning is an educational model that can be used from kindergarten to the university level across all subjects and disciplines. More than just community service, service learning challenges students to apply their classroom lessons by asking them to investigate a problem in their community, plan solutions, take action through service, and then reflect on their experience. 
   By integrating classroom learning with real-world challenges in the community, service learning can make school assignments come alive for our students. At the same time, we are also encouraging our young people to help improve our local neighborhoods. Studies have shown a connection between service learning and higher academic achievement, enhanced classroom engagement, increased attendance, better problem solving skills, and a deeper understanding of cognitive complexities. 
   Research also suggests that students involved in service-learning opportunities build self-confidence, leadership skills, and increase their tolerance of others. This all makes service learning a successful strategy in reducing negative behaviors such as those that lead to dropping out, arrest, or unintended pregnancies. 
   In addition, service learning promotes involvement in our democracy, development of strong ethics, and a sense of social responsibilities. For example, studies have shown that high school students that participated in service learning are more likely to vote 15 years after their experience than those that did not participate. 
   And finally, students who are exposed to service learning build important social and personal skills. Service learning is an onramp to civic engagement for a lifetime. 
   In order to call attention to the many benefits of service learning, the National Learn and Serve Challenge will take place October 6-12. This week-long nationwide celebration of service will raise awareness of service learning and foster collaborative partnerships between local schools, institutions of higher education, and their surrounding communities. The organization has set an ambitious goal of having 5 million college students and 50 percent of K-12 schools engaged in meaningful service by 2010. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for the National Learn and Serve Challenge, and I encourage more schools to take advantage of the many benefits service learning can have on our students and our communities. 
   I urge the adoption of this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   A fundamental precept of our American democracy is that individuals stand up for their rights and beliefs and pursue justice through civil means. Many who participated in the Civil Rights Movement did so at great personal sacrifice. Their actions were often heroic and tireless, and challenged the practice of racial segregation in the Nation, which resulted in equal rights legislation for all American citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6625 will make certain that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides the voting assistance and opportunities that our veterans deserve. 
   H.R. 6625 responds to a Department of Veterans Affairs voting assistance policy established in May, which was misguided and unacceptable. The VA directive permitted voting assistance only if requested. It prohibited election officials and nonpartisan organizations from providing assistance to our veterans at VA facilities. Despite the policy changes made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs last week, the policy still doesn't offer the meaningful voter registration and voting assistance our veterans deserve. 
   H.R. 6625 will require the VA to assist our veterans by permitting States to designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies under section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act. In addition, the bill would prohibit the VA from banning State and local election officials and nonpartisan groups from distributing nonpartisan information about voting and providing voter assistance at VA facilities. 
   Voter registration drives conducted by these election experts have energized millions of voters who historically have not participated in elections. H.R. 6625 requires that nonpartisan groups with the expertise and experience be allowed to assist veterans with the voting process with minimal disruption to facility operations. 
   My district in San Diego is home to a large concentration of veterans. I  know that the future of our country matters so much to them, and they want to be involved. Certainly, the veterans who have fought and suffered to protect our democracy should be given every opportunity to vote. 
   Much has been said about the importance of this bill for voter registration, but I'd like to draw your attention to section 4 because it may be the most important part. 
   Section 4 provides veterans with assistance in voting by absentee ballot, also called voting by mail. It requires that absentee request forms be available in VA facilities and ensures that veterans can get help completing their absentee materials and returning them to the elections office. 
   Why is this so important? Not only does voting by mail save voters what can be a difficult trip to the polls, but it allows them more time to study their choices. For veterans, having time to vote without the pressure of a line of people behind them is especially helpful because many are voting in new jurisdictions where candidates and issues may not be familiar to them. Further, some of their illnesses or injuries mean they need additional time to mark their choices. 
   Unfortunately, voting absentee is not as straightforward a process as it should be in many places. State rules vary widely about who can vote absentee and how. Some States have forms with plenty of fine print, others require a formal letter just to request an absentee ballot, and some States even insist on doctors' notes or notary signatures. And of course, different States have a range of deadlines that must be met. 
   To make sure that votes count, some veterans could really use assistance navigating this overly complex process. I am pleased that our committee passed my legislation to lift some of the restrictions on voting by mail, and it is my sincere hope that we will make voting absentee more doable for everyone. 
   In the meantime, the least we can do for our brave veterans is to give them a little help with their absentee ballots. 
   I want to thank Mr. Ehlers for working with the committee to draft language that guarantees our veterans will always receive the voter assistance they need. I would also like to thank the 54 colleagues who have joined Mr. Brady and me to introduce this legislation and especially applaud the dedication and work that Representatives FILNER and WATSON have shown on this issue.     
   Our veterans have dedicated their lives to protecting our democracy and our government and we should be dedicated to ensuring veterans that they are given every opportunity to vote and participate in the very democracy they defend. 
   I urge all Members to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor not only one of my colleagues but a dear friend, the Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   As we all know, she served the 11th Congressional District of Ohio with dignity and pride, and she represented her district with compassion, always with compassion, fighting for justice and equality. 
   I was very fortunate because, when I arrived here in 2001, my office was right across the hall from Stephanie's, and so you can imagine how embraced I felt 
   by her and by all of her staff, by all of the people who were so close to her, such a loyal group of people. 
   There have been many stories told this evening, and many more will be told of her accomplishments; there have been many tributes that people have paid to her, but in this very brief time, I just wanted to talk for a minute about how her influence goes far beyond the district that she represented because, for years, Representative Tubbs Jones had been a special guest speaker before a group of young people from San Diego, the Aaron Price Fellows. She always came to those meetings at my request, and was always so enthusiastic. She would just captivate this room of high schoolers, who come from very diverse backgrounds, with warmth and humor. She would weave her congressional experience with her personal stories to excite the whole group, and she would encourage their discussion. She'd love their questions and really would be so energized, energized in that room of young people every year that she spoke to them just as she did every time she spoke on this very floor. I think it says so much about Stephanie that she shared her time and a lot of that time with students far from her district. 
   So, today, we remember her as such an inspirational leader, inspirational for so many--from high school students, to her constituents, of course, and to all of us here--to her colleagues. I am proud to say that I will continue to be inspired by her as I serve in Congress, and I can just think her saying today, ``Hey, girlfriend.'' So I want to say to her ``Thanks, girlfriend. Thank you for everything.''

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. As a representative with a bustling port in San Diego, I fully recognize the importance of this historic occasion, and I am very proud to join my colleague in honoring the Port of Los Angeles and celebrating its 100th anniversary. 
   As my colleagues have cited, the Port of Los Angeles is a bastion for commerce and the economy for the region, and it provides one out of every 24 jobs in Southern California. 
   Madam Speaker, we know that seaports are gateways for domestic and international trade connecting us to the rest of the world. And because ports are naturally located on coasts and inland waterways, they really play a special opportunity to act as environmental stewards and caretakers for our precious coastal resources. Just last year the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach jointly released the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, which aims to reduce emissions by 50 percent over the next 5 years. 
   It's true, every single one of our districts benefits from the imports and exports that flow through the Port of Los Angeles. 
   So I want to urge my colleagues to join me in bestowing this well-deserved honor on the Port of Los Angeles after 100 years of successful operation, and I particularly want to commend my colleague for bringing it forward.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I represent 100,000 college students and eight colleges and universities in the San Diego region, and obviously I am very interested in the provisions in the conference report for College Opportunity and Affordability Act. And I am proud of this agreement for many of the reasons that have been given, but I am proud of it for these reasons also: 
   It makes servicemembers eligible for more financial aid. It stops student loan interest from piling up when servicemembers are off serving our country. And, it guarantees our men and women in uniform will not use their academic standing when they return. And, also, because it allows students to receive work study payments when they are prevented from working by natural disasters such as we had with the wildfires in the San Diego region. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, Chairman Kennedy, and Ranking Member Enzi for their hard work. I urge the adoption of this conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. I also want to applaud Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Miller. 
   When I was growing up, women only had a few career options. You could either be a teacher, a nurse, a secretary or a social worker, all very noble and difficult professions, but which don't pay nearly enough, mostly because a disproportionate number of women still do these jobs. But when my granddaughter enters the workforce, she will be able to work in any field she wants. So we have come a long way. But we still have, as many have said, a long way to go. 
   The tragedy is that our daughters and granddaughters will do the same jobs as men on a number of occasions in a number of fields, but will only earn something like 77 percent of what their male colleagues earn for the same work. So despite the progress that we have made over the past four decades, many employers continue to overlook and occasionally even intentionally ignore the contributions of their female employees. 
   It is about transparency. That is what we are talking about today, to give women who traditionally have stood by and been hesitant about taking full credit for their hard work the tools that they need to be certain that they are recognized in the workforce for what they are actually accomplishing. 
   Employers must recognize all of their employees for this important work that they do and reward them with fair compensation. Unfortunately, despite what we are hearing, it is not happening on its own. Our daughters and our granddaughters need this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I want to thank my distinguished chairman for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the holiday season is a time of joy for most Americans, it can be a very difficult period for our servicemembers and their families. When I sit down with members of our all-volunteer force, whether it's in my district or in the mess halls in Iraq, I'm very aware of the stress military service can have on our servicemembers and, of course quite specifically, on all of their family members as well. The stress of being deployed over the holidays can only be more difficult. 
   Mr. Speaker, a vital component of our strong national defense is the ability to care for members of our force, as well as recruit and retain men and women to serve in the military. To quote the first Commander in Chief, ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their Nation.'' With this bill, current and future generations of servicemembers will know that their Nation cares for their sacrifice. 
   Mr. Speaker, why is this bill important to men and women in uniform? It provides a 3 percent across-the-board pay raise for our troops. The compensation we provide our servicemembers must remain competitive with the private sector. 
   We were also successful in making major improvements to the Reserve Montgomery GI Bill. For the first time there is a 10-year portability in benefits for Reservists so they can continue to receive educational assistance after they separate. 
   Additionally, this bill will help services recruit and retain desperately needed health care professionals by prohibiting any further conversion of military medical professionals to civilian positions. 
   Mr. Speaker, most importantly, the mental health needs of our troops continue to grow, and this bill includes a number of provisions that will improve access to quality care for members and their families. The creation of Centers of Excellence on TBI and PTSD is just one example. 
   This report also includes a number of the recommendations from the Dole-Shalala Commission, including an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover family members of those on active duty so they can care for wounded servicemembers on extended leave for up to 26 workweeks. Family members will no longer have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a wounded loved one. 
   This bill addresses one of the concerns Members have heard from their constituent Reservists, early retirement. The bill would reduce the age at which a member of the Ready Reserve can draw retired pay below the age of 60 by 3 months for every aggregate 90 days of active duty performed under specified circumstances. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is so much more I wish we could do for our men and women who serve, but I feel that this bill represents the best efforts of this body to provide for our Nation's Armed Forces and their families. 
   I would like to thank my predecessor, Representative Snyder, and ranking member, Representative McHugh, and the Personnel Subcommittee staff for all of their hard work on this conference report.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (TORTURE VICTIMS RELIEF REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. I want to express my strong support for the Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act, H.R. 1678. This important legislation funds treatment centers for torture survivors who now live in the U.S. 
   With help, torture survivors can recover from their trauma, rebuild successful lives, and be contributing members of our society. When these new Americans rebuild their lives, we all have much to gain. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the efforts of Survivors of Torture, International (SURVIVORS) in my district of San Diego, California. SURVIVORS is an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to caring for survivors of politically-motivated torture and their families living in San Diego County. 
   Approximately 11,000 torture survivors are living in San Diego County today. These survivors are from countries where the systematic use of torture is documented, including nations in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. 
   Since its founding in 1997, SURVIVORS has helped more than 650 torture survivors from more than 50 countries to recover from their trauma through a holistic program including medical, dental, psychiatric, psychological, legal and social services. There is also a need to continue to make services even more comprehensive. 
   SURVIVORS empowers torture survivors to reclaim the strength and vitality that were stolen from them by brutal dictators and governments. The specialized care SURVIVORS provides these vulnerable individuals helps them to become self-sufficient, healthy members of their own families and of our community. SURVIVORS currently serves more than 300 survivors of torture and their families living in San Diego County. 
   SURVIVORS works with refugees, asylees, asylum seekers, and immigrants who are survivors of torture. By working with this large population in San Diego County, SURVIVORS is strengthening the Nation: many of its clients move to other communities in the United States after receiving the care and services necessary to successfully build a new life here. As SURVIVORS continues to work in the community, it receives an increasing number of referrals and requests for services each year. 
   The professional backgrounds of SURVIVORS' clients include: business, religious, government, and farm leaders; university students and educators; journalists; physicians and nurses. The significant majority of SURVIVORS clients suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, or both. These are normal yet disabling reactions for ordinary people who have endured the extreme trauma of torture. 
   Madam Speaker, the TVRRA also authorizes a contribution to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture (UNVFVT). Funding from the U.N. helps many centers feel more secure in the dangerous work of aiding those that a regime has identified as its enemies. The UNVFVT supports nearly 200 treatment programs all over the world, including nearly all U.S. centers. 
   H.R. 1678 is a vital piece of legislation which funds essential services for survivors of torture throughout the 53rd District of California and San Diego County, and enhances the standing and reputation by exporting America's values in the form of support for foreign treatment centers. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that is so important to so many.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585. 
   This legislation recognizes the extraordinary efforts by our servicemembers and makes great strides towards resetting our force and ensuring our overall readiness. However, it is only the beginning. 
   We know that part of readiness is having a military health care system that understands the strains on our force and is capable of handling the mental health needs of our servicemembers both at home and abroad. If we are going to deploy our men and women at the current pace, we must, we must, make sure we understand the consequences of our policy decisions. We must prepare our troops for the stress of service in theater. 
   I agree with General Petraeus, who recently spoke in favor of redoubling our education efforts to identify potentials for abuse among our servicemembers. The recent Army study indicating tolerance of torture among some of our troops shows why we need to do more. 
   Through mental health provisions in this bill, Congress has begun to ask important questions, important questions about the results of war and developing best practices for identifying and treating combat-related stress disorders. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (HONORING THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND SUPPORTING THE VICTIMS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, Kurt Vonnegut once said, ``I can think of no more stirring symbol of man's humanity to man than a fire engine,'' and I agree. Last week, my district in San Diego bore witness to extraordinary displays of humanity and resiliency as wildfires swept through our region. 
   We owe a debt of gratitude to the firefighters, National Guard and military personnel who fought and continue to fight the fires on the ground and in the air. Some of them lost their homes, others were seriously injured,  and all made enormous sacrifices to ensure public safety. 
   The firefighters with whom I spoke, it has been mentioned that they came from throughout the State and beyond, said Mother Nature outdid them on this one, but they do not feel defeated, and instead they were anxious to get back to work performing their job. 
   In addition, I think it bears repeating that San Diego County and City leadership should be commended for coordinating a quick and effective response. And I agree, San Diego region should be used as a model for the country. There is much that we have learned and much that we can also teach. 
   Last week, firefighters caused the largest evacuation in California's history. As residents fled the fires, volunteers from all walks of life came forward to help the evacuees. I saw such a tremendous outpouring of compassion and support at the evacuation centers. San Diegans rolled up their sleeves and found a way to help their neighbors during this crisis. 
   At Qualcomm Stadium, I spoke to a volunteer who is a professional tour guide. He realized he could put his organizational skills and strong voice to work at the relief center. The coordinators at the stadium agreed and assigned him to training volunteers. 
   I also saw staff from the City's Park and Rec Department organizing entertainment for children and families, volunteers passing out food, and even massage therapists helping evacuees to relax. 
   Although the majority of fires are now under control and many residents have left the evacuation centers, the San Diego region faces a lot of hard work in the months ahead. Our prayers go out to the many families who lost their homes. 
   As the shock and heartbreaks subside, we must do everything in our power to ensure that full recovery is within sight as soon as possible. And as we think ahead, Mr. Speaker, to the precarious nature that we are in and the inevitability of future massive fires, we must also engage in the most serious discussions of lessons learned. 
   I support House Resolution 778.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, as the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, I'm pleased to support H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   As my colleagues and the other subcommittee Chairs have noted and will note, I think, as they speak, this bill is a bipartisan effort. I want to recognize the committee chair, of course, Mr. IKE SKELTON, and the ranking member, Mr. Duncan Hunter, for their exemplary leadership. 
   I would also like to recognize my ranking member on the subcommittee, Mr. McHugh, for his support. I also want to thank our dedicated staffs on both sides of the aisle for extraordinary work. 
   Each year has been extremely challenging to meet all of the wishes that we seek for those who are serving in harm's way. And this year was certainly no exception. However, the defense bill before us continues to enhance and improve the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families who are bearing the brunt of 6 years of war. 
   Let me highlight some of the important initiatives that we address. The committee supported the President's proposal to increase end strength for the Army and Marine Corps and restores the military to civilian conversions within the medical community that were prohibited in last year's bill. 
   The bill includes a 3.9 percent pay raise which is one-half of 1 percent above both the President's budget request and private sector raises as measured by the Employment Cost Index, the ECI. This is the 10th consecutive year of pay raises above ECI, and this raise will further reduce the gap between military and private sector raises from 3.4 percent to 2.9 percent from a high of 13.5 percent during fiscal year 1999. 
   The bill establishes a tuition-assistance program for eligible military spouses to develop careers that are portable as they move with their servicemember from base to base. 
   The bill also authorizes a career intermission pilot program that would allow those who are seeking a military career time-off from active duty for a period of several years in order to pursue other life achievements. 
   The reserve components have moved from a strategic force to an integral and vital part of the operational force, particularly in the Army. The bill would increase full-time manning for the Army National Guard to 30,450 and the Army Reserve to 17,070. 
   The bill prohibits TRICARE health and pharmacy fee increases proposed in the President's budget. I'm pleased that we were successful in finding the offsets necessary to prohibit the fee increases to protect our military beneficiaries. 
   However, the committee remains concerned that the department continues to put forward proposals that place the focus solely on our military retirees and fails to address other cost drivers within the system. So we must work together to find a fair and equitable solution that protects our beneficiaries and ensures the financial viability of the military health care system for the future. The bill begins efforts to improve the health care readiness of our force and their families by establishing preventive health care programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill before the Members today is a good bill, and Members can be proud of what we are doing for the troops and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, President Kennedy compelled the Soviet Union to remove offensive missiles from Cuba without a shot being fired. The Soviet missiles represented a true threat, but President Kennedy knew that the consequences of war were severe and that there was a viable option short of direct military confrontation. 
   The Iranian threat, while certainly a continuing and growing concern, cannot be compared to the danger of Soviet efforts during the Cold War. The President's perceived rush toward the possibility of military conflict with Iran highlights the executive's inability to find real solutions to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons or supplying weapons to our adversaries in Iraq. We must exhaust every economic and diplomatic opportunity before even considering a military response. 
   This administration has reduced our leverage around the world, but there is still time to build an international consensus around this issue. Congress has a constitutional responsibility in this debate. I hope Members will urge the President to take the moral high ground and deal with Iran through  international pressure, not unilateral action.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Ms. Zoe Lofgren's bill, H.R. 5803. In our State of California, voting machines were decertified after a careful scientific review showed them to be prone to problems. Now we use paper. We don't need backup ballots. But many jurisdictions still use the voting machines that they purchased. And it becomes obvious that even under the management of the most diligent election officials, glitches with voting systems are rare, but they are inevitable. 
   The question is not whether there will be some technical problems on Election Day, but how will we respond? How bad will they be? Asking voters to come back is not a solution. We must have a plan B, a plan B ready on the spot. 
   That is what this bill gives us. Most of the time, as we know, emergency ballots will go unused. But we cannot afford to be without them. Opponents would argue that it's wasteful to invest in something we hope never to use. Well would we ever think of not investing in life rafts on ships, air bags on cars, or fire escapes on buildings? Emergency paper ballots are the air bag of our democracy. We can't afford not to have them in place when the vitality of election is on the line. And we know, Mr. Speaker, that in November, that will be the case. The election could be very close. And the country needs to come together in the end. 
   If people believe that somehow they didn't have the opportunity to vote, then they will perceive that this was not a fair election. After a spirited election, people will come together, but only if the American faith in our democracy has been borne out. This is one way to help. And I believe that we must go forward and look at this. Only the States that need it will apply. And I would expect that they would be very prudent in the way they request that  kind of funding through the grant program.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 908. I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for sponsoring this important resolution. 
   I want to share with you an inspirational story about a young man from my district in San Diego. Eduardo Corona was only in the ninth grade when he got into trouble with the law. Because of this mistake, he faced up to 6 years in a juvenile correctional facility. Instead of going to that facility, the judge met with him and spoke with him and allowed Eduardo to participate in a mentoring program called Reality Changers. I have had an opportunity to meet with the young people in that program and I can tell you, they are inspirational and very engaged in their lives and hoping to change the community someday. 
   Reality Changers brings at-risk youth in San Diego together with their mentors, half of which are college students from the University of California at San Diego, and for about 3 hours a week over a 4-year time, these mentees study with their peer mentors, they take weekly practice SAT tests, do homework together, listen to guest speakers and take part in leadership development seminars. 
   In addition to that, Reality Changers also sends its participants, all of which come from low-income families, to a summer program at UCSD where they take college level courses and prepare for higher education. With the help of his mentors in Reality Changers, Eduardo was able to turn his life around. In just 30 days, and this is kind of remarkable to me as I had a chance to work with some of the issues that he had to deal with, Eduardo doubled his  GPA to 3.8. He attended UCSD's summer program and won two awards in mechanical engineering. And although he is just a sophomore in high school, he has already earned college credit and is well on his way to becoming the first member of his family to attend college. 
   In fact, I need to tell you that all of Reality Changers' participants who have completed this 4-year program have gone on to a 4-year university. Not bad, considering all of these young people are the first in their families to attend college. I think Eduardo's story really tells us and proves that with the right role models and people who truly care about them, our society's most challenged youth, challenged in many different ways, can turn their lives around and become leaders in our community. 
   But we know that Eduardo fortunately and even programs like Reality Changers are not unique to San Diego. At this very moment, there are countless mentors across the Nation who, through their hard work and dedication, are making miracles happen every single day. And so that's why I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support this resolution that Congresswoman McCollum has brought forward and join all my colleagues here, and I am pleased to see them, to support House Resolution 908. 
   In addition to this resolution, I ask all my colleagues to join me in support of increased funding for our Nation's mentoring programs, because we know that with that help, we can replicate Eduardo's success all around the country.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our troops by urging passage of H.R. 3174, the Equal Justice For Our Military Act, a bill giving our servicemembers equal access to the United States Supreme Court. 
   We all know when American men and women decide to serve their Nation in the Armed Forces, they make many sacrifices, from lost time with their families to irreplaceable loss of lives. Servicemembers also sacrifice one of the fundamental legal rights that all civilian members enjoy. 
   Members of the military convicted of offenses under the military justice system do not have the legal right to appeal their cases to the U.S. Supreme Court. After exhausting their appeals through the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, they have no recourse. In fact, the playing field is weighted in favor of the military, granting the automatic right of Supreme Court review to the Department of Defense when a servicemember wins a case. But servicemembers are denied the same right in nearly every case the government wins against them. 
   It is unjust to deny the members of our Armed Forces access to our system of justice as they fight for our freedom around the world. They deserve better. 
   As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, a long time advocate for servicemembers and a Representative from San Diego, one of the largest military communities in the Nation, I feel an obligation to fight to ensure that the members of our military are treated fairly. 
   I introduced, along with Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton, H.R. 3174 to correct this inequity. This bill has been endorsed by the American Bar Association, the Military Officers Association of America, and many other legal and military advocates. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office has stated that this bill does not affect direct spending. 
   It is fundamentally unjust, Mr. Speaker, to deny those who serve on behalf of our country one of the basic rights afforded to all other Americans. I hope that all of my colleagues will stand with me in strong support of this legislation to attain equal treatment for those who fight for us.

   Now, early in the 110th Congress I introduced the Veterans Education Tuition Support Act, or H.R. 2910, to guarantee tuition reimbursement and readmission for every servicemember deployed while attending college. Now, I did that because I had heard from a number of servicemembers about their situations. Many reported that they had problems during activations, including harassment from bill collectors for tuition, and difficulty re enrolling back into school. 
   Our men and women in uniform already face unthinkable levels of pressure and stress while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they deserve to know that they will treated fairly by their institution and can easily return to their studies after the mission is over. 
   I am pleased that Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin has included provisions from H.R. 2910 into H.R. 6225, and I want to thank the committee for taking up this very important issue.

   Usually, Mr. Speaker, I pride myself on seeing two sides of an issue, but honestly, I have looked, and I can't find another side on this one. 
   I like this bill, because any Member of Congress who has been convicted of a criminal offense doesn't deserve to get his or her pension. And I like this bill for another reason, too. No matter how small the amount, each dollar that now goes to criminal ex-Members can be used to fund vital programs at a time when we are challenged with record debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, I love this institution, and it makes me angry that the bad behavior of a few has disgraced Congress and harmed our Nation, and, in fact, this is a very important first step. Perhaps in the future we can go beyond this. And it frustrates me deeply when members of the media and the public say that we are incapable or unwilling to reform ourselves.

   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to honor those who make a difference in the lives of our young people across the United States. This January marks the National Mentoring Month 2007, a month-long event honoring those who are mentors. This event also draws attention to the great need for additional volunteer mentors. 
   As we know, Mr. Speaker, many of our children can become lost at an early age without a responsible adult to show them the way. Our children need to know that somebody older cares, and that is what mentoring is all about, showing our kids that we care. Unfortunately, many of our children do not have such an adult in their lives, and without a solid role model, the consequences for our children can be detrimental. 
   Mr. Speaker, a third of those entering high school do not graduate and will face limited job prospects, according to the Government Accountability Office. This alarming statistic I think would be lower if each one of these kids had a solid mentor to stress the importance of education. 
   There is no substitute for a healthy relationship with an adult. A caring adult is one of the most important aspects of adolescent development. When a responsible and reliable adult becomes a mentor, the benefits to the mentee last a lifetime. 
   Another aspect of mentoring sometimes that we overlook are the vast  benefits to the mentors themselves. Helping a younger person find their way can be extremely fulfilling, and often those who become a mentor continue to volunteer throughout their lives. 
   Chris Warren became a mentor to Joshua Becerra in my hometown of San Diego through the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program in 1999. As a mentor, Chris taught Joshua the value of education and encouraged him to study hard in school. Joshua is now a student at High Tech High School and has already visited UCLA, San Diego State University and other campuses trying to decide where to attend college. 
   As a role model, the relationship has given Chris a healthier perspective on what is important in life, that is, helping others. 
   The relationship between Joshua and Chris shows what a mentor can do for a young person, and it also shows the joy it can bring to the mentor. 
   Millions of adults nationwide have similar relationships with children who face problems at home or struggle at school. Unfortunately, research shows that about 15 million children across the United States are in need of a good role model. 
   This resolution calls on more adults to make a difference in the lives of our young people, and we in Congress also need to heed this call. Federal programs that encourage mentoring need our support. The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program began in 2001 to provide guidance and friendship to children with at least one incarcerated parent. Funding for the program was targeted for a 20 percent reduction for the current fiscal year. Funding for a number of mentoring programs through the Department of Education was targeted for considerable reductions as well. I urge my colleagues to increase our support for these programs and to put a priority on mentoring. 
   We must also encourage programs that recruit young people to become mentors to those who are younger. It is these programs that will help create a cycle of mentoring between the generations. 
   The bottom line: our children need strong, responsible mentors. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the millions of adults, and there are millions of them out there, who are mentoring our children, and call on more adults to become role models to those who are in need. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to bring this resolution to the House floor to call attention to this worthy cause on the occasion of National Mentoring Month 2007. I urge its passage today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I really am pleased to be here on behalf of this resolution today. I urge and thank those who have continued to volunteer as mentors in our communities to continue on with those efforts, and I urge that those adults who have not embarked on mentoring think about it and join with some organizations that could help them move forward and help many of our young people who are in the community today and who need their help, their support and certainly the caring that they bring.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (CONGRATULATING ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of House Resolution 57, a resolution congratulating Illinois State University on 150 years of educating students. 
   Illinois State Normal University was founded in 1857 as Illinois' first public university and opened with an enrollment of just 43 students. The university's very beginnings were touched by history. Four years prior to his election as President, Abraham Lincoln himself drafted the original bond guaranteeing that the citizens of Bloomington, Illinois, would finance Illinois State. 
   Originally established as a teachers' college, Illinois State University now offers undergraduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study and 39 graduate programs. 
   In 2005, the university enrolled more than 20,000 students, and 83 percent of its new freshmen students were in the top half of their high school graduating class. 
   Public colleges, as we know, provide a great service by offering affordable options of higher education and encouraging access for minority and low-income students. This role is increasingly important as the cost of attending college continues to increase. 
   Illinois State University has embodied this spirit of access to higher education in public service. It is not more clear than in its mission statement. And that mission statement reads: ``We devote all of our resources and energy to creating the most supportive and productive community possible to serve the citizens of Illinois and beyond.'' 
   Illinois State University has graduated many notable alumni who have given back to the university, the State of Illinois, and this country in so many ways. There are an estimated 155,000 Illinois State University alumni living around the world, and many of these students have gone on to great accomplishments, including Thomas Edison's State College president George Pruitt; two-time Academy Award nominee John Malkovich; and former U.N. Ambassador for the U.S., Donald McHenry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Illinois State University on 150 years of service to their students and alumni, the State of Illinois, and the Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to resoundingly pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, we have lost a dear friend and colleague in the House of Representatives. The world has also lost a great humanitarian. 
   As the only Member of Congress to survive the Holocaust, Congressman Lantos had a deep understanding of the value of freedom and the need to pursue human rights around the globe. He brought life experiences to his work that nobody else could. 
   On a personal note, I was extremely saddened when I heard the news of his passing. After arriving back in Washington today and seeing the flags at half mast, it set in that he won't be with us any longer. 
   I will miss him. 
   He was always very gracious during my conversations and dealings with him. I would listen closely when he spoke because what he had to say was always important. I urge my colleagues to honor Chairman Lantos' memory and fight for human rights and justice around the world with the same passion that he did.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4. 
   Three years ago, during the debate on the Medicare Modernization Act, I stood on this floor and told my colleagues that we can do better, that we can do better with a bill for our seniors; and today's vote will bring us one step closer to providing seniors with affordable and reliable prescription drug coverage by allowing the Health Secretary to negotiate drug prices. 
   As we move forward with H.R. 4, we can and we will safeguard future innovation and support lifesaving therapies befitting the 21st century.     
   Representing a district with a vibrant biotech community, I applaud the leadership's effort to ensure that our seniors have choices. This summer, one of my constituents named Judy wrote me, and I quote, ``I have reached the doughnut hole and must now come up with the money for my high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid, and cholesterol medications.'' The question she asked is, ``which one will I stop taking? I cannot afford all of them.'' 
   We can do better for seniors like Judy, and today, Mr. Speaker, we will.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, last year Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill that allows servicemembers to get a deferment on their student loans when they are activated, but that particular deferment only applies to repayment of the principle and existing interest on these loans. It does not prevent new interest from accruing while our servicemembers are on active duty. 
   One Reservist told me that while he was granted a deferment on his loan, he was told that the interest would continue to accrue while he was away and would be added on to his loan when he returned. Servicemembers such as this Reservist already have enough to worry about when they are called to active duty without this added burden. 
   This amendment will cover all active duty servicemembers, including Reserve units and the National Guard. 
   According to CRS estimates, this will help the average servicemember save between $1,200 and $1,500 over the course of a 12- to 15-month activation period, with even more savings for those activated for longer periods.  
   In addition, and the best part, the CBO scored this amendment and found that it will not cost the American taxpayer any significant amount. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2956. 
   I just returned from Iraq. The trip was only a snapshot of what was happening on the ground, but I heard two messages: One, we need more time to train Iraqi troops and leadership; but two, progress is not evident. We are taking two steps back for every step forward. Our men and women are serving heroically, but it is clear our progress is limited, at best. So where do we go from here? 
   Mr. Speaker, we need a plan that moves beyond the surge to a time frame that says we will continue to support Iraqis in a limited capacity but that we will redeploy the bulk of our forces within a prescribed period of time. 
   We are all concerned about the impact our redeployment could have on our adversaries, and the region as a whole. However, the reality on the ground is that, whether it's in 6 months or 2 years, the size of our current force cannot be sustained. The true focus must be on how we disengage, how we and our allies work together to support our aims for a free and open society in Iraq. 
   Our choices are bad, awful and worse. But this legislation, I believe, will move us a step closer to a day when Iraq's leaders and politicians can take back control of their country and our men and women can return home to their families and a grateful Nation.

   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, because in many ways he has really made the case for us. The argument on his side has been that we can't just use our military, the tools that they bring us, the great treasure that we have in them. We cannot solely look to them. And I think our great consternation over this war has been that we have not used our political, our economic and our diplomatic tools to represent the great Nation that we are. 
   I have to tell my colleague that I was really saddened when the veterans of my community asked me, and I have asked our generals and I have asked the President, are we in fact a military at war and not a Nation at war? The generals told me that we are a military at war. I think the President disagreed with that. But the reality is that we have not brought our Nation to this effort in the way that I think is appropriate to have done. And so when we talk about the strategic risks that are there, when we talk about the fact that we need to understand those risks, we are doing it in a context that we know that when we went to this war, we didn't properly assess those risks.     
   We failed to do that, and we can't fail to do that any longer. 
   So what we bring to the table and what we bring to this discussion and this debate, and I think it has been a good debate, Mr. Speaker, is I think it is important, as a lot of my colleagues have said on both sides of the aisle, that we represent the people of our community. 
   I often go into schools and talk to students about what representation means and tell them that it would be really impossible to take their entire class to Washington and have everybody there to speak on the floor of the House. Well, we are honored, and I know that my colleague is too, to be in the House, to be able to make those presentations, and we do it for people who actually sometimes disagree with us as well as agree with us. But it is important that we do that. 
   I think what we bring to this debate is to try and understand what these strategic risks are today. You made my case, and I appreciate that, because there are many conflicts, and we need to understand them. That is why only focusing on a troop escalation, which isn't 20,000 troops, Mr. Speaker, we know there are probably another 15,000 in support troops, and those 15,000 troops, which are there for support of combat troops, sometimes get in the way. We know that, and we know we have had many deaths from our support troops as well. So we need to think about this as a much larger troop escalation. 
   But the reality is we need to utilize all of our other tools, and we want to put the pressure on our country, on this administration, on the Iraqi people and its government and all of our friends around the world to help us and step up to the plate; not to just rely on our military, not to just rely on our treasure. We believe that is essential to make the statement. 
   So I want to close, Mr. Speaker, by saying that this has been a good debate. It will continue. It will continue into tomorrow. Then Members will have an opportunity to vote and to let their constituents know how and why they chose to do that.

<DOCNO>Mrs. DAVIS of California. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   I want to recognize the ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, Mr. McHugh, for his contributions to this bill. It provides significant personnel benefits and policies that are important to our men and women in uniform and their families, and I believe it merits full support. 
   Some of the highlights of the military personnel area include the following: A 3.9 percent pay raise, an increase of .5 percent above the President's request; prohibition on increases in TRICARE copays and deductibles; preventing TRICARE pharmacy copay increases for a year; establishing a tuition assistance program for eligible military spouses; growing the end strength for the Army and the Marine Corps; increasing full-time manning for the Army National Guard. 
   We also provided over $50 million for Impact Aid to local educational agencies; increased the use of preventive care services by TRICARE beneficiaries, including waiving copayments for preventive services and creating smoking cessation programs. 
   Finally, this bill creates a Department of Defense task force on the prevention of suicide. 
   Our Nation has been at war for 7 years. Repeated deployments continue to take a hard toll on our servicemembers and their families, and the bill before us recognizes their sacrifices and addresses the increasing support that they and their families need to be trained and equipped before, during and following a deployment. 
   Mr. Speaker, we would not be here today without the leadership of Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter, and I want to wish my colleague from San Diego well as he leaves the Congress. Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter have gone through extraordinary lengths to ensure that this Congress will have a defense authorization bill. I also want to thank my subcommittee staff for all of their hard work over the past year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
