<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today a terrible storm hit across the State of New Hampshire. There has been death and destruction in five counties, and we have declared a state of emergency there. I am asking for the prayers of this country for the people of New Hampshire. They're a strong lot. For ages they have helped one another build their homes, their barns, their stone walls, their businesses. I know that they will find the resources once again to help each other through this calamity. 
   I ask the people of the country and the Congress to keep their thoughts and prayers on the people of New Hampshire tonight.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, the administration's policies of the past 7 years have led us to this point. The American people know that prices have gone up for everything, from groceries to heating oil to gasoline, while at the same time jobs are moving overseas, the housing market is in a crisis and the economy is struggling. This is what happens when there is no oversight for 7 long years and mismanagement is allowed to run rampant. 
   I'm pleased that we did come together in a bipartisan manner to produce this bill. Over 117 million American families will receive rebates under this plan, including 600,000 in my own State of New Hampshire. 
   This bill also helps small businesses, which are at the heart of our Nation. It is a very good start, but we need to do more for senior citizens and for those who receive Social Security. We need to do more for families who need to stay warm this winter. They are the most vulnerable members of our society. They need help the most, and we know they will put the money directly into the economy. 
   We must continue to turn this Nation's attention towards restoring a vibrant, robust middle class.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you, Congresswoman. 
   I am on the Armed Services Committee and we've had many, many hearings on this issue. It has become very clear to me that we need a plan to redeploy responsibly and to start it immediately. 
   First, let's go over some of the facts once again because it is a national security issue here. There were no Iraqis on the plane that day. 9/11, there were no Iraqis. But we were attacked by people who had been trained in Afghanistan in Osama bin Laden's group, and we needed to go there. We needed to go to Afghanistan. We still need to win in Afghanistan. But somehow or another we got diverted to Iraq, and we have paid the price, and the Iraqis have paid the price as well. 
   We are now spending $10 billion a month, that we acknowledge, in Iraq. We really don't know the cost. We borrow money from Communist China to pay for this. 
   I was a military spouse and so I'm feeling particularly protective of our troops. Our soldiers are exhausted. We send the same team in over and over again. This is an American problem, not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem. It's an American problem, and it calls for an American solution. 
   Let us talk about what it looks like in Iraq right now. And I have been there. What it looks like right now, and it was the independent Jones report that verified this, and I appreciated the report very much, retired General Jones and his commission. What they talked about was 2.2 million Iraqis displaced within the borders of Iraq. Every single month for the past 6 months, 100,000 Iraqis have moved. They've left their homes, their communities, their jobs, if they had jobs, and they have moved. 
   Now, why would 100,000 people move? Because it's not safe. It's as simple as that. We've had ethnic cleansing there. If you look at the maps that was in the Jones Commission, 2005, you could see in the neighborhoods in Baghdad that they were mixed, Sunni and Shiia living side by side. By 2007, the mixed neighborhoods are virtually gone. They've had ethnic cleansing. They have militias. 
   People say, well, you know, take a look at this. The Sunnis have joined with the United States to defeat al  Qaeda. No, not really. What it is is an enemy of my enemy is a friend. What has happened here is that the Sunnis have joined with the U.S. right now so they can rid themselves of their enemies. 
   We estimate that al Qaeda is maybe 7 to 10 percent of the violence there. But the reality is that most of this violence is still a civil war. It comes from within and it has not gotten better. 
   We know that 95 percent of the children are showing terrible signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder. We know that they have dirty water. We know that they have 2 hours of electricity if they're lucky. 
   We know that in every way to measure standard of life, it has declined. Why are we still there? That's the question that all of us are asking. Why are we still in Iraq? And why does the President have a plan that says, stay. Stay for how long? Just stay. That is not acceptable to the American public anymore. 
   I yield back to you and I thank you very much for bringing this to the floor today so that we can tell the American people what has really happened, what we have heard from independent commissions, and what the reality is for the people of Iraq and the people of the United States. 
   I would like to add one more point which is important. Let's look at the American benchmarks and let's ask where America is now. Where are we on education? Where are we on health care? Where are we on jobs? Where are we on infrastructure? We have poured so much money into Iraq. What about American benchmarks?

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you, Congresswoman. 
   I am holding in my hands a report to Congress from September 6, 2007 called ``The Independent Commission Security Forces of Iraq.'' This is retired General Jones. They did an absolutely wonderful job, nonpartisan, and I'm very pleased to say that it seems incredibly accurate and fair in all respects. 
   Here is a concern, or one of the many concerns that I have, and I just want to read a couple of lines and talk about it. It says, Iraq's central government in Baghdad, and this is page 39, does not have national reach in terms of security, nor does it have a monopoly on use of force, a defining characteristic of a functioning nation state. Militias continue to play a prominent role and are seen by American and Iraqi officials alike as posing almost as significant a threat to Iraqi stability and security as al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   Now, isn't that fascinating? We hear them talk about al Qaeda, al Qaeda, al Qaeda in Iraq. Al Qaeda was not in Iraq on 9/11, 2001, and yet we have militias roaming around and there is very little talk about that. 
   Now, as this report states, if you have militias, it means that the Iraqi Central Government is not in control of their streets. This is where we have our soldiers, in the middle of a civil war. And this is the reason that we've had ethnic cleansing and the other problems that we're having. 
   I want to talk about the Iraqi political establishment for a moment. Our troops have done everything they've been asked to do. They are guarding the streets. And yes, violence has gone down where our troops are, and it's a great credit to our troops, but I can tell you right now that if you put 50 policemen and women on a corner of any major city in America, or anywhere, crime would go down because these forces do a terrific job, but it doesn't mean that you've changed the hearts and minds of the people, the criminals. What we have here is an Iraqi Government that has not stepped forward. And so we are relying on our troops to not only control the violence in Baghdad, but also to run everything. 
   The Iraqi Government, the Parliament, wanted to take 2 months off this summer in the middle of this crisis. When the White House, Tony Snow, was asked about the 2-month vacation, he said, well, it's 140 degrees there. And somebody said, well, aren't our troops in 140 degrees as well? 
   The Iraqi Parliament also, more than half of them, signed a petition asking the United States to leave Iraq. Now, this is not leadership. Our troops have waited for years for Iraqi leadership to step forward and run their country.     
   We cannot ask our troops to not only be the police there, be the cop on the beat there, but also to be the politicians there. If the Iraqi Government will not, cannot, step up, we have to finally say we have to step down. It has been just too long. 
   So picture that, what it is like, and you will understand why 100,000 Iraqis have been leaving every month and why there is more than 2 million people who are now out of the Iraqi borders. They have lost their middle class. They have lost anybody who could help the society. They have fled. And you understand why, when you think about militias and you think about the lack of Iraqi political leadership. You didn't hear very much about that coming out of the White House. Ask them to name the Iraqi politicians, the leaders, who are going to take over, and ask when. Because they can't say when. They can't name who is going to take over. We cannot leave our troops there indefinitely until the Iraqis decide to find political reconciliation. 
   That is the problem. As long as we have our troops there, yes, we can tamp down the violence where our troops are. But we must have a government. That report shows that they have militia wandering around and that the Iraqi Government has not stepped up to the task. We are in our fifth year, Americans know that, our fifth year of our treasure and our blood of our people. It is time to stop.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I would also like to point out that this really is a national security issue for the United States of America. General Peter Pace was asked if he was comfortable with the ability of our Nation to respond to an emerging world threat. He paused and he said, ``No, I am not comfortable.'' 
   We have our troops bogged down in Iraq. We do have enemies around the world, no question about it, but our military is strained. We know that the troops could not stay at this pace past March anyway, so it is natural that the President would call to bring back some of the troops in March. It is not really progress. It is just acknowledging that we have to have them back. But here is the issue: If you know there is a burglar in your neighborhood, the first thing you do is you lock your own door. We didn't do that. We went to Iraq instead of locking our own door. We didn't even pass the 9/11 recommendations. The 110th Congress had to take care of that business. So, finally, we are going to be inspecting cargo from airplanes, and we are going to be inspecting cargo that comes from overseas, and we are going to inspect 100 percent of it after a period of time. That should have been done immediately. We should have beefed up homeland security, locked our doors, so to speak, and then worked with other nations to catch terrorists. They were ready. 
   On 9/12/01, we had the world's sympathy and empathy. They were ready to work with us to catch these horrible terrorists. Instead, we went to Iraq, and now our brave troops are bogged down there. The Iraqis have suffered enough. It is time to bring them home responsibly and to start looking at building up our troop strength again so that we can respond to anyplace around the world that we might need to be.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the American people are painfully aware that the 110th Congress inherited a failed energy policy. They feel the pain at the pump, they feel the pain in their heating bills, and they know our country is dependent on foreign oil. They know that is dangerous for us. They know that the oil will run out some time, and they know that fossil fuels are damaging our environment and causing health problems. They know that Congress has not increased miles per gallon standards for 32 years. 
   Now Americans want to know what Congress is going to do. Americans want to know if we are going to continue to fiddle, to delay, to stall, as some in Congress wish to do, or will Congress be bold and show leadership? 
   This 110th Congress must confront these problems or history will judge us harshly. The leadership is here. The time is now. The bill is good. I urge my colleagues to step up and forward into our future by voting ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, almost 8 years ago two oilmen arrived at the White House. They devised an oil policy that left everybody else out. And now we are seeing their very successful oil policy where we are paying for their secret policy. And yet we didn't hear a word from the Republican side of the aisle. And now, when we are paying almost $5 a gallon, suddenly they are talking about drilling in ANWR. 
   Now, they know, as well as we do, as well as the Department of Energy knows and says, that it would take 10 years to get any gas from that. The American family would spend $57,000 before they saw one penny from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We need to drill now and we need to drill domestically, and they have the leases. 
   And don't ever be surprised by the fact that the oil companies are claiming there is nothing underneath there anyway, because what they are really doing is buying back their stock. 
   So my suggestion to the oil companies is to get to work now. Start drilling domestically with what you have. You have 80 percent of the leased land. Use it or lose it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Chair, it is my honor to be on the committee that has brought this bill forward, and I urge my fellow Congressmen and -women to say ``yes'' to this bill. 
   What this bill is doing is finally representing the working men and women of America. It is finally giving them an opportunity to once again regain a decent wage and to regain benefits. 
   It is critical for our country and for our middle class to have this bill passed, but there is reason for this also. Because when people have worked in factories before without union representation, they worked under extremely difficult circumstances. 
   In the early 1970s, I worked in a factory during the summers when I was in college. And I saw people come in and try to form a union, and I saw them get fired as soon as they heard about it. And so the people who had to work there day after day, year after year had to suffer under some pretty terrible conditions that most people would not accept. 
   So the union is critical and the support for it is critical. But I also support the idea that people can vote out in public. And I vehemently disagree that this will in some way harm individuals. I live in New Hampshire; and in New Hampshire, many of the towns still have town hall meetings. You stand there publicly and you vote. And nobody experiences any great tragedy for speaking as a body and as an individual in that body to say what direction they want their town to go in. This has been part of our history from the very beginning, and I am proud to endorse this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, today we will vote for legislation supporting the goals and ideals of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day. 
   For nearly 100 years, the Veterans of Foreign Wars has served a straightforward and noble mission, honoring the dead by helping the living and by providing friendship. 
   In my home State of New Hampshire, we have nearly 10,000 VFW members, another 4,500 members of the Ladies Auxiliary. I'm honored to be their representative in this House and to work with them to ensure that all of our veterans and their families receive the full support and benefits they have earned. 
   The VFW has been an outspoken advocate for veterans rights. It has called for expanded health care for veterans, increased funding for research into traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. It has also asked for improved access to health care and for veterans support for mental illnesses and treatment. 
   When I met with my veterans advisory committee last fall, one prominent member of the VFW asked me to support a sufficient budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am happy to report that the 110th Congress passed the largest budget in the 77-year history of the Veterans Affairs. 
   The House of Representatives has heard the call of the VFW and other veterans organizations and has passed bills to support and fund these critical issues.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, for months now, economic experts have been warning that our economy was in trouble. After some disturbing signs about job losses in this country, the President finally came out and made some comments saying that there were ``mixed signals'' about the state of the economy. 
   These are not mixed signals about the state of the economy, and Americans understand. Americans know they are having more trouble paying for their mortgages, having trouble paying for their heating bills, having trouble paying for their gas, having trouble paying for all the costs of living in America right now. 
   The President should not continue to call these signs ``mixed signals,'' should acknowledge that we have some problems, and work in a bipartisan manner to straighten this out. 
   He might also wonder what impact the war in Iraq is having as we pour billions of dollars into Iraq and take the money from our own people and then borrow the money to continue the fight in Iraq. He might ask himself if this, too, is hurting our economy. 
   I ask the President to work with us to find answers for America's working people.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I was interested in hearing from Members on the other side speak about the money we needed to save and the debt we have, because it was the Republican administration that drove us into the greatest deficits in history. Indeed, they are the reason I am standing here today. 
   I am a social worker by profession, and for years I noticed things were getting worse and worse for the middle class. I kept saying the middle class is stumbling and the poor have fallen, because while the very wealthy were enjoying the tax breaks, thanks to this administration, the middle class was trying to figure out if they had enough money to go to the movies on Friday night and have money for pizza. Indeed, this is the first time we have seen this great, great difference in the rich and the poor since the time of the Titanic. Wages have been flat for several years now. 
   The American public understands this. This is not a Republican issue, it is not a Democratic issue, it is an issue about protecting the middle class, building the middle class, and bringing the poor so we do not have a permanent underclass in this country. The way to do that is to make sure we have a fair tax system, and we have to have accountability and oversight to make sure that we do. 
   We know that the tax breaks have gone to the top 1 percent for too long. So this drove me to Congress, looking at this; and the final, final nail in the coffin was looking at what happened after Hurricane Katrina because even if the administration could not find it in their hearts to take care of the people of Katrina, where was the homeland security? 
   When you look at Louisiana, you realize there is a port there. Gas and oil are there. Our food, our grains come there. Seventy percent of the grain passes through there. Certainly that is a vulnerable area. We heard that we were spending all of this money for homeland security and for programs to protect the American people. But when Hurricane Katrina hit, the American Government was missing in action with the exception of our military, and I give them great credit for what they did. 
   I know this because I went there not once, but twice. It was very frightening to see that the Federal Government was missing in action. And then the extra insult of having to listen on television while they were praising each other for the good job they did. They didn't bring the resources to the American people. They didn't have the money to bring the resources to the American people. 
   Where is the money? That is why we are here in Washington, to find out where is the money for the programs that the American people need, that we must have to protect us. 
   I looked at Iraq. I went there a couple of weeks ago. I looked at the contractors there personally. There are more than 100,000 contractors in Iraq for 133,000 soldiers; some more now, we had over 100,000 contractors. 
   The American public knows this word so well, Halliburton. The American people understand what has happened to the money. Every child born today has a birth tax of about $29,000. Think about that. We went from a budget surplus to the greatest deficit in history, borrowing money from Communist China along the way to pay our bills, which is a security risk that all Americans understand, and every child born today owes about $29,000 before he or she draws their first breath. This is an outrage, and we need to turn this around. 
   Like the rest of my freshman class, this propelled me to run. I had never even run for office in elementary school or high school. I was a social worker. I taught politics. Yes, I got involved in politics, but never envisioned myself here. And it is a tremendous honor to be on the floor and to be able to protect and speak up for the American people. 
   But we have an obligation to, first of all, provide programs that lift the poor and the middle class, to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share; and we have an obligation to be fiscally conservative, and we can do that by good fiscal oversight and accountability. That has been missing for many years. 
   We are having more hearings now looking at various aspects. I serve on the Armed Services Committee. It was a shock to me to find out that we did not have the equipment we need and that the soldiers were suffering so. 
   Again, we can talk about Walter Reed. We had a week last week about that. Who could leave a soldier in rooms that had mold? Who could leave soldiers unattended and untreated? If we are going to honor our soldiers, we need to honor our commitments to the soldiers, and it is not right to say if we can afford to. When we put them into battle, we make sure that our commitment will be to care for them. Once they say they are going to serve us, it is our obligation to serve them. 
   It is truly an honor to be here and to be able to be working for the people of my own State, New Hampshire, and the people of this country. It is an honor to be here with such wonderful colleagues who are driven by one motive, and that is service and patriotism. 
   We were campaigning over a year or 2 years. We heard the message loud and clear from the middle class that they needed protection. They needed protection from policies and this administration that protected the wealthy and harmed the middle class. They wanted their children to be able to afford college again because that changed. They wanted their children to have the opportunities that they had growing up. 
   Even rents have gotten so high and with wages so flat, adult children have to come home to live with their parents. This is not the American way. The American way is to be fiscally responsible and to make sure that opportunities are available for all. 
   I think we have a terrific class with wonderful leadership. Speaker Pelosi certainly understands the direction this country needs to go in. We will do the job that the American people sent us here to do.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, yesterday President Bush asked Congress to rubber-stamp his plan to spend $196 billion next year on the war in Iraq. I have to tell the President: not a nickel more for this war. 
   Since the beginning of this year, congressional Democrats have been trying to change a war policy from one where our troops will stay there for more than a decade, to one where we have a responsible redeployment and bring the troops home next year. The President believes it's acceptable to spend billions of dollars in Iraq, while important domestic priorities here in our own country go unmet. 
   While the President was crafting his $196 billion war supplemental, the Democratic House approved appropriations bills that included targeted investments in our priorities here at home: education, health care for veterans, more police on the streets, caring for American families. 
   Madam Speaker, as Congress begins to examine the President's latest war-funding bill, we will once again demand that the President change course in Iraq and get a responsible plan to bring our troops home within the year.

Our generals are speaking to the President of the United States, who does not seem to be listening. I would like to read this to the President of the United States on this day. 
   General Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked last month by a House panel whether he was comfortable with the preparedness of Army units in the United States, he stated simply: ``No, I am not comfortable.'' Mr. President, that is one of your generals. General Peter Schoomaker, Army Chief of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday: ``We have a strategy right now that is outstripping the means to execute it.'' Mr. President, that is one of your generals. 
   The Army Vice Chief of Staff, General Richard Cody, described as  ``stark'' the level of readiness of Army units in the United States which would be called on if another war breaks out. The readiness continues to decline of our next-to-deploy forces, Cody told the House Armed Services Committee Readiness Panel last week.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I feel exhilirated at the end of this week. As I was campaigning through my district, the First District of New Hampshire, over and over again I kept hearing questions about what can Congress do to help the middle class and what can Congress do to help grow the middle class, to lift people into that robust middle class that we all want. And certainly this week we have shown what we are capable of doing. People are worried about Congress being able to get together and pass any legislation that would actually help the people. This week we have shown that we know how to get this job done. It certainly is an exhilirating feeling to be part of this. 
   We watched out for the taxpayer this week. We passed a PAYGO, pay-as-you-go. We said to the taxpayers of this country, we know your taxes are high, we know that you're worried about the highest deficits in American history, and we're going to do something about it. We're going to pass some programs that help you and we're also going to make sure that we don't drive up the deficit. 
   And then we looked at people who have children in college and we said, we know that you need help and we're going to help you. We cut the interest rates in half. Yet it didn't cost the taxpayer a dime. That is awesome. I feel wonderful and proud of the leadership, the Democratic leadership that brought this forward, and I am delighted that so many Republicans joined in that vote, because I think that it helps all of us. 
   Then we took a look at Medicare part D and we knew there was something wrong with Medicare part D. What was wrong with it was that the American taxpayer was not at the table when that was passed. It was the insurance companies, it was the pharmaceutical companies, but senior citizens were not there and neither were the American taxpayers. And so we said, we're changing this legislation so we will make sure that they have to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. 
   Now, we did hear a lot of hollering that this wouldn't help, but I will tell you something, you would never find the CEO of a company ordering their purchasing department not to negotiate the price of anything. We all know, children know when they are little, they take their lunches and they try to cut the best deal for themselves trading. We understand that you negotiate if you want the best deal for the American public and that is what we did. 
   So we can go back to our districts and we can look at everybody and say, we understand, because we come from you. We're the freshman class that have been out there listening to the issues and we have come to the floor of the House and with the help of the Democratic leadership and certainly some Republicans that joined forces with us, we have passed some pretty significant legislation. So when my child goes back to college next year and the American children go back to college next year, they know that when they leave college, we have reduced their debt 
   $4,000 over the terms of their loan. And when senior citizens go to their pharmacies for their prescriptions, they know that we did the best  that we could for them this week. It's a beginning. There will be more to be done, of course, but it is an impressive beginning. And when people go to the gas pump, which is the other way that we saved money for the American taxpayer, they know that we are not going to subsidize the oil companies anymore, that we are not going to take taxpayer money and give them a subsidy. This is what we have been asked to do and this is what we delivered this week. 
   I congratulate everybody who had a part in this and I urge the American people to stay tuned, because we are going to continue to deliver what the American public has asked us to do and what they need us to do. While we do that, we are also going to be paying attention to the international scene. We know that we have to have a strong national defense. We understand that we have enemies in this world and that we have to be careful. That is why we made sure that we will have containers that are inspected and that is why we looked very carefully with the 9/11 Commission and we said, yes, they're right and we need to do this now. On September 11, 2001, I was on the Beltway in Washington, D.C., and it was a terrifying place to be, no question about it. But I would go out to my district and say, we can't live in fear but what we have to do is be sensible and take action to keep us safer. We can't cower in fear but we can pass legislation that will protect all of us. We need to be on the world stage. We need to be bold. We need to take action to make sure that we are safe, but we also have to make sure that we don't terrify Americans. 
   So this week we said, here is some legislation that is going to protect you at the airports, it is going to protect you at the ports, it is going to protect our Nation and we are moving forward on every direction. I am delighted. It has been a wonderful couple of weeks and I know with all these good people working hard that America can continue to be reassured that we will lead the country in the right direction.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for your leadership on this bill, in particular for your strong support of increased funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System which protects our valuable natural resources and wildlife and maintains more than 96 million acres of land across the country. 
   I also want to thank ranking member Tiahrt and the entire Interior and Environment Subcommittee for their tireless work on this bill and, importantly, for including language and funding to help address some of the most pressing problems facing our National Wildlife Refuge System. 
   Mr. Chairman, the staffing shortages plaguing our wildlife refuges have been brought on by years of underfunding and a lack of commitment to ensuring that these pristine lands are kept safe, secure and properly maintained. The language included in the bill before us is a big step in the right direction, but I think you would agree it is only a first step. 
   We will need to do more if we want to alleviate the strain put on our refuges, like the Great Bay Wildlife Refuge along the eastern shore of New Hampshire. Great Bay protects a number of both Federal- and State-protected species, including the symbol of our American freedom, the Bald Eagle. However, funding shortages have caused the refuge system to severely cut back on staff at Great Bay over the past few years.     
   What once was a staff of four has been reduced to one, and now the refuge system has announced that they will be eliminating that position as early as next month. This will leave a major wildlife refuge with no full-time staff and totally unprotected for the large majority of the time. With over 60,000 visitors a year, this lack of staffing could pose a serious threat to the wildlife and ecosystem protected in Great Bay. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is strong language in your bill regarding the staffing shortages at refuges across the country. May I clarify that the increased funding provided to the wildlife refuge system through the operations and management accounts is meant to help the system address these shortfalls and ensure that staff is placed where needed to protect these environments?

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased as Speaker Pelosi decided to assert Congress' power over international trade by waiving ill-advised fast-track rules, and I hope the decision to waive the 90-day deadline for a vote on the Colombia FTA will effectively kill the agreement. 
   This is not a good idea at this time. Colombia has not proven that they are capable of providing the human rights that the people of Colombia so desperately need. Passage of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would greatly diminish our Nation's reputation as a leader in the fight to end human rights abuses worldwide. Like the Peru agreement which preceded it, the Colombia FTA is based on the flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model which also led to the outsourcing of millions of high-paying American jobs. This comes at a time when our own country is in a recession and experiencing unprecedented job loss. 
   All around, this is not a good idea, and I hope that we will kill this.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will not bring success in Iraq or make America more secure. It faces significant bipartisan opposition in both Chambers of Congress, and the plan is opposed by a majority of people in our country. 
   The American people rightfully want to know where their leaders stand on this critical issue, and the House is prepared to act. Unfortunately, on the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans blocked debate on this critical issue, and the House is prepared to do it now. 
   While Senate Republicans cut and ran from this most important issue, over the next 4 days this House will debate, and then on Friday vote on a resolution on the President's plan to escalate the war. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats will ask the tough questions about the President's new strategy and continue to insist on a new direction, while always putting our troops first. 
   The days of rubber-stamping the President's war plans are over. And starting today, this House is going to have an important debate on the President's troop escalation plan.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, this is a very important debate. Four long years and we are searching our souls. We have sent our finest and our bravest soldiers on a mission that made no sense from the beginning. Our Nation was attacked by evil people who trained in Afghanistan. 
   We have a right to go into Afghanistan to remove the terrorist training camps. As a matter of fact, we should be working even harder there to make sure our Afghanistan mission does not fail. We must not allow the Taliban and other terrorist groups to control Afghanistan again. 
   However, we are unable to give Afghanistan our full attention because our President has led us into a war with Iraq. Why? There are no Iraqis on the plane that day. The Iraqis had no weapons of mass destruction. And they never asked us to come to their country. They do ask us to leave, though. And yet we will not leave. 
   The President will not listen to the Iraqis. The President will not listen to the American people. The President will not listen to the world. But Congress will. We are ready to go in a new direction and say no to the President, and no to his plan to escalate this war. 
   I was a military spouse. I am very, very proud of my husband's service. I am also on the Armed Services Committee. I know our troops need our support and they have it. But troops also  need to know that their leaders will make sure that their mission is in the best interests of the United States before they are asked to go fight and die for their country. 
   I watched a young soldier walk down a ramp on the way to Iraq. He was looking at all of us, and we were looking hard back at him. And I think most of us had the same thoughts in our hearts, that we could not look him in the eye and tell him that his mission was so essential to the security of the United States and the freedom of the world that he had to go and he had to die if necessary. 
   Why could we not tell him that? Because the mission had changed. Several times the President told us why we were there, and it was always a different reason. The mission had changed. And therefore the soldier looked confused and we certainly felt confused also, because we could not tell him why we were there. 
   I wanted to run up to him and tell him I support you, I support you by making sure that you never get sent to a war against unless we know why you are there. 
   What is this talk I have heard tonight about freedom and liberty? This talk of glory that I heard on the floor. This romanticized language, this talk about Davy Crockett. There is no Davy Crockett in Iraq. Our troops need clear-eyed leaders, not this romantic rabble that we have been hearing. This war has cost us. We have paid a terrible price. 
   Our military troops are strained. Yes, they are strained. Their families are strained. Our brave soldiers have died or they have been injured. The Iraqis have lost their lives. They have lost their society. They have lost their infrastructure. They are losing their middle class who are moving to other countries to keep their children safe. 
   Their people are fleeing from their own country. We are wary, they are wary, the world is now more dangerous. Iraqis were polled and the majority of them said they wanted the Americans to go home and let them work out their problems. For 4 years the administration and its supporters here have made no plan for them to do that. 
   Now they ask us on this side of the aisle what our plan is. This is a strange question. But it shows how confused this administration's supporters are, if they are looking to us and ask us what our plan is. They have been offered plans. They even commissioned a plan, and they do not follow any plans. The President follows his own way. 
   We have offered plans. They will not listen. I for one want the United States to succeed in this world. Therefore, I am going to listen to all of the generals who have pled with the President and pled with the President's supporters in this administration to do the right thing here. 
   But the President does not listen. Now, I am going to vote to tell the President that I am against his escalation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS ``TOMMY'' MAKEM -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Tommy Makem was one of the greatest Irish-American performers to ever grace the stage. Not only have his works inspired generations of artists, but his determination and success broke down barriers that had long been raised to Irish Americans. Tommy and the Clancy Brothers, with whom he played for many years, were instrumental in breaking down these cultural divides. 
   Tommy lived a truly remarkable life. He arrived in America in 1955 to pursue a career in acting, having just won the All-Ireland Championship in acting. Like so many immigrants before and after, Tommy arrived with very little, carrying with him only a makeshift suitcase, a pair of bagpipes and proof of his health. However, it did not take Tommy long to find a life in America. 
   In 1956, he joined with the Clancy Brothers--Patrick, Tom, Bobby and Liam--and they began performing together. In 1961, Tommy performed at the Newport Folk Festival and, along with Joan Baez, he was heralded as ``the most promising newcomer.'' In 1963, Tommy and the Clancy Brothers performed at the White House at the request of President Kennedy. They continued to perform together for years and played venues from Carnegie Hall to the Ed Sullivan Show, until Tommy embarked on a solo career in 1969. For decades, he continued to compose and perform. He would later reunite with the Clancy Brothers in 1988 for a reunion concert. In 1999, Tommy was awarded the World Folk Music Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. 
   Tommy was not just a musician, he was so much more. Tommy was an author, a philanthropist, a businessman, an inspiration and, most importantly, he was a loving father, grandfather and husband. 
   Tommy passed away earlier this year on August 1 in Dover, New Hampshire, where he lived for many years. He left behind a daughter, Katie Makem-Boucher, and two grandchildren, Molly Dickerman and Robert Boucher, and three sons, Shane, Conor and Rory, whom with his nephew, Tom Sweeney, continue the family folk music tradition. They will remember Tommy for the living man he was and for the impact he had on their lives.     
   Upon his passing, condolences streamed in from all over the country, as well as the world. The Makem family has said that while many talked about his music, most noted what a generous and kind man he was. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and honor the life of a truly remarkable man, an immigrant who touched the lives of so many. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I thank all those who worked so hard to produce this bill. 
   Last year, the class of 2006 listened as Americans spoke out demanding that we change direction in our energy policy. Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, understood that America was in an energy crisis, that we were too dependent on foreign oil, that we were unable to carry the message of conservation across this land, and that we had very poor gas mileage at a time when the technology has been in existence for many years. So Americans asked Congress to make this change, and we were sent to Washington to do that. And I am standing here today so proud to say that this is the day that we are going to answer Americans' concerns. 
   We have now passed a bill, or will be passing a bill, that is not one that has everything that we wanted in it, obviously, but we have the direction and we have the energy and we have the resources and we have the plan. 
   We are increasing the gas mileage. For the first time in over 30 years we are finally increasing our gas mileage. We are reducing our oil dependence on foreign nations. We have been forced to talk to foreign nations for our oil. That is the wrong approach in this country and an unnecessary approach. We are increasing biofuels, which will be our future, and we are growing jobs. This is critical for our economy right now. We are expecting that there will be 3 million new jobs across America because of our green incentive here. 
   We are increasing our energy efficiency, and we are also convincing the younger generation that conservation is our future, and that our generation is listening to their generation and protecting future Americans. I urge my colleagues to recognize what we have done here and to support every effort of the legislation, and I thank those who brought this to the floor.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, gas prices are hovering around $4 a gallon now. Americans are having difficulty just finding the money to drive to the store. The energy policies of the Bush administration over the past 7 years have helped only one group, Big Oil. They're doing just fine, thank you very much. 
   House Democrats are moving America in a new direction towards energy independence. We raised the miles-per-gallon requirement for the first time in over 30 years. We are putting money into research and development. We're requiring energy-efficient appliances, and we are creating green jobs, among other things. 
   We're also demanding that oil companies drill now. They have 68 million acres of land that they could drill on. They have their permits. They need to get to work now. Last month, House Republicans could have joined us in sending a strong message to oil companies that they need to start drilling on already approved lands. But instead, House Republicans once again sided with both Big Oil and President Bush. 
   Mr. Speaker, the oil companies need to use those permits or lose those permits. America wants oil companies to get to work now and stop playing politics.

   Supporting our troops means getting them out of a civil war. Support our country by caring for our own people and bringing our money home to protect our borders in this country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I'm really not sure why we're under this great rush to make these agreements, especially with a couple of countries that were named that do not have good human relations records and are not bastions of freedom. I don't understand, and I think most Americans don't understand, why we are so anxious to cut some kind of a deal, when we know that Americans are losing jobs. 
   I walk through my own community and I see empty factories. I look around the State of New Hampshire and I see people have lost jobs, and people shrug and say to me, the jobs have gone overseas. They may not understand exactly what the trade agreement was, but they know they lost their jobs. 
   And in December, once again, we'll see a factory close in New Hampshire. This is a great tragedy. We may discount 20 jobs, 100 jobs, 200 jobs here and there, but ultimately what we're saying to Americans is we're sending your jobs overseas, and we hope that you'll be retrained, and we hope that you'll be able to finance your home and finance your car and educate your children. But really, this globalization effort is in your best interest. And you know, sometimes it is. 
   Democrats are not against free trade. But what we are for is fair trade and making sure that our own people can maintain their lifestyle and that they'll have worker benefits and that they'll be able to retire, just like the generation before. 
   I'm holding in my hand an article from The Washington Post from today, and Harold Meyerson wrote, and he's so right, ``Why the Democratic rush on trade? Globalization does pose real challenges to working and middle-class Americans. Democrats should wait until they're in a position, say, in 2009, to begin to restore some security to Americans' economic lives before they return to cutting trade deals. Their electoral prospects, and the Nation's economic prospects, demand no less.'' 
   I'm a freshman here, and I came in with a lot of other freshmen who heard across their districts the worries of middle-class, working-class Americans worried about their futures. We share that worry, and that's what's made us stand here tonight. 
   Why can't we have a moratorium? Why rush? Why take the chance? 
   Moving to other nations for cheaper labor is not fair to Americans and, in the end, will hurt our own country. 
   So I urge my colleagues to say ``no'' to these deals.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, energy independence and fighting global warming are essential, and they are the challenges of our day. Years of inaction, even disbelief on the part of the White House and the Republicans, have delayed any real work being done. 
   This week the Democratic Congress will bring a bill to the floor to change this. There will be an Energy and Water appropriations bill that will provide substantial funding to fight global warming. Overall, the bill appropriates $3 billion for researching the effects of global warming. This funding will allow us to monitor radiation in the atmosphere, to use state-of-the-art computer technology to conduct climate change modeling and to conduct long-term experiments on the impact of increased carbon dioxide levels on forests and other ecosystems. 
   This research will finally allow us to have the science that we need to fight this battle. We have delayed it for years because of the Republican administration's inactivity. I hope that this week the Republican leadership will join with the Democrats in Congress to finally move this forward.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (DEMOCRATIC FRESHMEN HOUR -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I am happy to be here. I am standing here tonight at 10:30 for the same reason that we are all here, because we believe that it's our obligation, our duty to defend the Constitution. This Constitution is a gift that has been handed to us through the centuries, and it's the envy of the world. This is what differentiates us from other nations. 
   To give you an idea of our Founding Fathers and what they thought about this, at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked, What have you wrought? And he said, A Republic, if you can keep it. 
   So they understood even then that we would have to defend this Constitution against well-meaning people who believed that they had to give up some liberty in order to make themselves safe. This is not the first time in our history that we have faced peril, as you know. This has been an ongoing issue for us through the centuries. There are always countries that wish to do us harm, and it is our obligation to keep ourselves safe and to keep the American public safe. But that is not what this argument is about, as you know, because we have FISA, and FISA is in effect. 
   Now the President more than suggested that the intelligence community went dark and that they would be unable to do any surveillance. But the reality is, and the President and the Justice Department had to admit recently, that the wiretaps could still go on. 
   I would just like to read this so people understand what we are talking about here. This is from Reuters: ``White House Says Phone Wiretaps Back on For Now.'' Here's the quote, the statement from the Justice Department, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence: ``Although our private partners are cooperating for the time being, they have expressed understandable misgivings about doing so in light of the ongoing uncertainty, and have indicated they may well discontinue cooperation if the uncertainty persists.'' Well, first of all, where is the patriotism there? If they believed this was for the good of the country, they should stay with this program, and will stay with this program. 
   Also, as my fellow Congressmen indicated, when they failed to pay the bills for the wiretap, these companies pulled the wiretaps, and we lost some critical information. So you have to wonder about that commitment there. 
   But there's a larger issue. First of all, we do have all the national security that we need right now. You're right that we need to tweak it, and we tried to. We tried to extend this for 3 weeks so that we could work it out. If it were so critical, why did the President and his supporters vote to let it go? We voted to extend it for 3 weeks. 
   So there's something that is counterintuitive and actually bizarre, that the President and his supporters would argue on one hand that we were allowing something to drop that was so critical and, on the other hand, refuse to vote to extend it for 3 weeks. So they didn't give us the time that we needed to do two things. We have to do all we can to protect Americans, and tweak this, but we also have an obligation to protect the Constitution while we do this. 
   So what have we done here? The intelligence community has not gone dark and the authority under this act allows the administration to conduct surveillance here in the United States of any foreign target. I am now reading from the House majority staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. It's important that we cite these sources so that we know. ``In the event that a new phone number or e-mail address is identified, the NSA can add to the existing orders.'' They can begin surveillance immediately, without a court warrant. Within 72 hours they have to get one. That sounds perfectly reasonable to have judicial oversight and review. 
   So it's not true that people can't do surveillance. They can do surveillance. They must do surveillance. If we think that there are terrorists talking on the phone, I want them to be able to listen in, and so do you. We have families here. We want the same protection that other Americans want. And they can listen in. 
   But there's something else happening here, and this is called the retroactive immunity for the phone companies. What do we mean by retroactive immunity. What is immunity about? If you don't do anything wrong, you don't need immunity. Immunity suggests that something happened, and you're asking for this protection. And how can we say, sure we'll give it to you until we know what they did? Why won't they tell us what they did? 
   I liken it to somebody, a defendant showing up in court and saying to the judge, Well, judge, I may or may not have done something wrong. I am not going to tell you. But I want you to say maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but whatever it is, you're forgiven right away. 
   We would not accept that from an individual, and we must not accept it for any businesses either. We are, as John Adams said, a government of laws, not men. Nobody is above the law. Not you, not I, not any individual, not any company. They knew what they were supposed to do. 
   I would like to point out that Qwest knew that, another telecom company, and did not follow the President's request there. The President is not the one who sets the Constitution. He is not the one who decides. We have three branches of government. We must have judicial review and oversight. And it's our obligation, as it has been on every Congressman and Congresswoman's shoulders, to watch out for this incredibly brilliant document that is the envy of the world.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. We were looking for a bipartisan agreement. If it's that critical, then we should have had the extension. But they know what we know, which is that FISA is still in effect, that they can eavesdrop without a warrant. That they simply, if there's an American involvement, they have to go get a court warrant within 72 hours. 
   By the way, that is not difficult to do. Over the period of years, there have been thousands and thousands of requests. I think only five have been refused. So this is not a problem. If they consider having to get a warrant a problem, I am sorry, but something stands between the President and this, and it's called the Constitution. 
   I come from a Republican family. My father was an attorney, and he was a very conservative Republican. I worked in his law office. And he taught me this great love for the Constitution. So the reason I point that out is because this is not a political issue. This has to do with the Constitution. And so regardless of whether people are Republicans or Democrats, what we saw here when they didn't extend it was a political maneuver. But it should not be. It is our first and foremost obligation to protect our freedoms while we protect our Constitution.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I would like to point out that if the President and his supporters managed to cut out the judicial branch, then the authority for this would go to the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. Our most recent former Attorney General was Alberto Gonzalez, and I think that we do not wish to put that kind of power into the hands of people who may not see the government's role the way that we do. So I have deep concerns about that. But, again, this is not an issue of what party you are in. This is an issue of whether you are an American and you believe in our Constitution or not. 
   I wanted to quote Andrew Napolitano, who was a New Jersey Superior Court Judge from 1987 to 1995, and is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News. He is upset about this as well, and he said: Those who believe the Constitution means what it says should tremble at every effort to weaken any of its protections. The Constitution protects all persons and all people. And, he said, if we lower constitutional protections for foreigners and their American correspondents, for whom will we lower them next? 
   And that really is the question. We stand our ground now, and we protect at least our American citizens from this eavesdropping. 
   The question earlier was, well, what do you have to hide? And I would say that even though you may not be placing phone calls that have anything to do with any government business, you may be having a conversation about your boss's wife or husband. You may be having a conversation about your husband's problem at work. You may be having a conversation about your neighbor. And any of those conversations, if they were overheard, could be used against you. So it is not simply the kind of setting that we are talking about right now, not a grander setting, a setting where it is national security, but simply your right to privacy and for your neighbors not to know the kinds of thoughts and the kinds of words that you share with people in private phone conversations. So we have this obligation to stand here and protect all of us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to voice my strong support of this bipartisan legislation. I became an original cosponsor of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007 because I recognize the inequities in our health insurance system. 
   As a social worker and administrator, I saw firsthand that insurance companies did not cover mental illnesses the same way they covered other illnesses. This created extra strain on patients, families, and health care providers in the communities they live in. Requiring higher deductibles and copayments also blocked access to health care for many. 
   H.R. 1424 remedies these problems by requiring mental health parity. There should be no difference between a pain in one's abdomen and mental pain or the pain of addiction, but these patients and their families do not receive the same support and help to stabilize their condition and walk the road to recovery. This is wrong and it's time to remedy this discrimination. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to mark the unfortunate 6-year anniversary of the war in Iraq, a war that is being financed by deficit spending, it's important to recognize the serious effects this war is having on our military. Our generals are warning that our military has been stretched and strained too far. 
   Perhaps that's why in a recent poll of 3,400 present and former military officers, 88 percent of them said that the demands of the war in Iraq have ``stretched the U.S. military dangerously thin.'' This is the worst readiness crisis since the Vietnam War, and military officers are justifiably worried about military preparedness. Military personnel are so concerned that nearly three-quarters of the officers surveyed in that recent poll said that their civilian leaders are setting ``unreasonable goals for the military'' in Iraq. And due to multiple deployments, the Army is facing a shortage of officers and enlisted personnel. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress is listening to the military. We will continue to push for a new direction, a new change, and an end to the war in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Yesterday, there was a resolution before the House which I voted for, and the reason I voted for it was because it stated it expresses our appreciation, talking about General Petraeus, for his personal sacrifices and those of his family, as well as the sacrifices of those who served in the Armed Forces and their families. 
   I too had a husband who served in the Armed Forces, and I was a family member, and so I supported that. But here is where I have trouble. It went on to attack MoveOn.org, saying such unwarranted attacks should be strongly condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike in the House. 
   I, too, would like to improve the tone here in this House. I would like to see civility. But they forgot to mention something in that resolution. They forgot to condemn the Swift Boating; they forgot to condemn the comments against Senator Max Cleland and other veterans who served this country honorably as well. 
   I wait for a new resolution that condemns behavior on both sides of the aisle attacking all veterans from all political persuasions. Until then, I support free speech.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I would like to thank the sponsor of this important resolution, the gentlewoman from California, Susan Davis. Congresswoman Davis is the Chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, and it is my great honor to serve with her. 
   As we prepare to honor our military and our fallen on Memorial Day, it is appropriate to honor the women who have served, also. Almost 800,000 have served since World War I, and together, women make up almost 15 percent of our active military and 17 percent of our National Guard Reserve forces. 
   Sadly, many of the women who earned medals and served this country never collect those medals. They served quietly and they left quietly, too humble to tell their tale and too humble to ask for their medals. 
   In New Hampshire, I recently had the great pleasure to present medals to Hazel Jones, 50 years after she had earned them in World War II. The Dover resident enlisted in the Army in 1944, completed her basic training, and went on to serve her country for the next 17 months, transporting troops and the mail and protecting our national security. 
   I was really proud to present Hazel with her medals, and I am proud today to honor the hundreds of thousands of other women who have nobly served our beloved country.  
   While women may not make up the majority of our Armed Forces, they stand and work side by side with the men, and they are critical to our mission. As we celebrate Memorial Day, it is fitting that we take this moment to celebrate their service. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (ESTABLISHING POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Illinois, Phil Hare, who's a leader and a tireless advocate for veterans. 
   This Memorial Day we honor the memory of so many who have served this Nation. In honor of their memory, it's fitting that we consider legislation today that will help deliver the benefits that were promised to our veterans and which they earned by their selfless service to our Nation. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 2790, will create the position of Director of Physician Assistant Services in the VA to manage the education, training, and utilization of physician assistants within the Veterans Health Administration. 
   PAs play an important part in the health care of our veterans, providing a whole range of diagnostic and therapeutic services, administering physicals, taking patient histories, diagnosing and treating patients. The first PAs were former corpsmen who had served in Vietnam. Their extensive medical training made them ideal candidates for further medical education and the perfect fit for the continuing medical care of their fellow veterans. Since the PA Advisor position was created in the VA in 2000, their ranks have grown, and today almost 1,600 PAs serve in the VA. 
   PAs go through a very vigorous 2-year-long certification program, and by creating a Director of Physician Assistant Services in the VA, we can help  ensure that their expertise is properly utilized and that our veterans receive the care they deserve. Their utilization may also mean in rural States like mine that veterans have greater access to health care. 
   It's appropriate that we will pass this legislation today in honor of the veterans who have served our country so bravely. As a proud wife of a veteran myself, working to improve the care veterans were promised and have earned is a top priority for me, and I enthusiastically support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this also.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush claims there are important differences between Democrats  and Republicans when it comes to spending and he is right. For 6 long years, President Bush and the Republican rubber-stamp Congress slashed budgets in critical areas such as health care, college aid and support for our veterans. 
   For years, Republicans have cut veterans health care funding and budgeted billions less than they need. Last year, Republicans failed to even pass a bill to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. Imagine that, did not even pass a bill. 
   After 6 years of Republican damage, Democrats will do things differently. This week, we begin to invest in America's priorities, and we're fiscally responsible. 
   While President Bush and the Republican Congress ignored the needs of America's veterans, the Democratic House will bring a bill to the floor that includes the largest increase in funding for veterans health care in the 77-year history of the VA. 
   Today, I would hope that this entire House would support our veterans by supporting this bill. It is long overdue, but the Democrats intend to deliver like our troops deserve.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, from its birth before the Revolutionary War, the National Guard has served as our first defense against catastrophic disaster. We all remember the scenes during Hurricane Katrina. The National Guard came to the rescue. They were the ones in the helicopters, along with the Coast Guard, rescuing people after FEMA had collapsed and had not fulfilled its responsibilities. 
   After we invaded Iraq, it was our brave soldiers in the National Guard that once again answered the call to duty. They have served side by side with the regular forces doing an incredible job. They also have a job to do in our country, though. But multiple deployments and use of equipment has degraded the equipment they have at home to protect us in our own States. 
   The National Guard currently has about 40 percent of the equipment that it needs at home. The American people deserve to know this, that we do not have the equipment that we need, and the National Guard has a right to have the equipment so they can fulfill their duty in case of a national domestic disaster. 
   I thank the National Guard and their families who stand by day after day, serving us during any kind of catastrophe. I urge the American public to  ask Congress and ask the executive branch to make sure that our National Guard has the equipment at home they need.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, last week, House Democrats unveiled the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, a bill that reauthorizes CHIP, ensures millions of children receive the health benefits they need, and protects Medicare for American seniors. The bill comes a week after the National Governors' Association, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, called for urgent action to reauthorize the CHIP program. 
   Unfortunately, while strengthening CHIP has broad bipartisan support from our Nation's Governors and the U.S. Senate, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans oppose efforts to strengthen the program so it does not continually run out of money. 
   As a professional social worker, I recognize the threat to America's children, and I must protest. Instead, they are proposing to underfund the program significantly, which would cause millions of children to lose coverage, including children in my own State of New Hampshire and States across the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, ensuring America's children have affordable health care costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child. House Democrats are committed to passing this cost-effective health coverage for millions of uninsured children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to offer House Resolution 266, which honors the dedication and compassion of professional social workers. Our highest calling as humans is to provide service to others, especially those less fortunate than ourselves. 
   At the turn of the 20th century, thousands of people lived in despair and poverty, and it was the early progressive moment in which the social work movement was born, providing food, clothing, health care and education to the less fortunate. 
   Social workers had a role in civil rights and in women's freedom. Today, social workers continue this fight to ensure that vulnerable families have the support and the health care that they need. 
   Social workers are everywhere in our society, caring for all of us. They help people in all stages of life, from children to the elderly, and in all situations, from adoption to hospice care. You can find social workers in hospitals, police departments, mental health clinics, military facilities and corporations. 
   Professional social workers are the Nation's largest providers of mental health care services. They provide  more mental health services than psychologists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses combined. 
   More than 600,000 people in the United States hold social work degrees. The Veterans Administration employs more than 4,400 social workers to assist veterans and their families with individual and family counseling, client education, end-of-life planning, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention and other services. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We don't really have a plan, but we do know that we have not succeeded in Iraq. In spite of the efforts of our brave soldiers, in spite of the 10 to $12 billion a month that we have spent, in spite of all of our efforts, we have not succeeded. 
   Now, if you look at the independent nonpartisan reports on Iraq, you find that 100,000 Iraqis are moving from their communities every single month. Why would 100,000 Iraqis move from their homes, from their schools, from their lives? They're moving because they're not safe. 
   We have militia roaming around. We've had ethnic cleansing in Baghdad. If you look at the maps of the neighborhoods, 2005 and now 2007, you realize that the Iraqis are not living together any longer. We have ethnic cleansing. 
   We also know that the Iraqi Parliament, more than half of the Iraqi Parliament, signed a petition asking Americans to go home. 
   We also know that the Iraqis wanted to take a 2-month vacation in 140-degree weather while our troops were struggling. It is time to bring our troops home and look at American benchmarks.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 326 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial right here in America's capital city. I thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Hooley) for bringing this measure before the House. 
   In capturing the tremendous sacrifice of our servicemembers, this memorial has helped our Nation heal from the losses our communities suffered throughout the Vietnam war. Maya Lin, the wall's designer, created the monument in such a way as to ``convey the sense of overwhelming numbers while unifying those individuals into a whole.'' The Vietnam Memorial is a testament to the ultimate sacrifice those who serve in uniform have made in defense of our Nation. 
   Over 4 million people visit the memorial each year. No one leaves unaffected by the experience. House Resolution 326 is our way, as Members of the United States Congress and citizens of this great Nation, of taking an important moment to pause in reflection and in gratitude for the freedoms we share today because of the contributions of our brave men and women in uniform in Vietnam. 
   Let us also take this opportunity to recognize those who are serving us on the front lines of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan and other hotspots around the world. Their sacrifice and devotion to duty continue in today's warriors. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 443, recognizing the service of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers during the Korean War, honoring the people of Puerto Rico who continue to serve and volunteer for services in the Armed Forces and make sacrifices for this country, and commending all efforts to promote and preserve the history of the 65 Infantry Borinqueneers. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for bringing this measure before the House. 
   In 1908 the United States Congress directed that a unit be established and comprised primarily of individuals from Puerto Rico, which was then renamed in 1920 as the 65th Infantry Regiment. Our brothers and sisters of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers fought valiantly and gave their lives during the Korean War and the two World Wars. 
   Since 1917 the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been a part of the United States and home to almost 4 million U.S. citizens. During the Korean War, Puerto Rico lost a disproportionate number of servicemembers relative to the population of the island as a whole. Eight soldiers of the 65th Infantry Regiment received the Distinguished Service Cross, and 129 were awarded the Silver Star for their heroism during the Korean conflict. 
   House Resolution 443 highlights an important group of servicemembers who have helped forge the foundation of the freedoms that we enjoy today. The 65th Infantry Borinqueneers are to be recognized for their tremendous sacrifice. We should not forget those who are serving today in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. 
   The people of Puerto Rico and all Americans can be proud of the tremendous contributions these men have made to the defense of our Nation.

   Our history is rich with heroes who have risen above and beyond the call of duty in service to our great Nation. The American flag billows proudly above this Capitol building, and even more boldly behind your seat, Mr. Speaker, due to the extraordinary heroism of our servicemen in times of war. 
   The 303rd Bombardment Group is certainly part of this legacy. Two 303rd Bombardment Group airmen, Technical Sergeant Forrest Vosler and First Lieutenant Jack Mathis, were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, four were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, 33 were awarded the Silver Star, approximately 1,200 Purple Hearts were awarded for those killed or wounded in action, and over 5,000 were listed as missing in action during World War II. While these numbers make me proud to be an American, statistics alone cannot begin to comprehend the tremendous service they have done for all of us. 
   The members of the 303rd Bomb Group Association have provided opportunities for 303rd veterans, families and friends to meet, and have perpetuated the memory of the 303rd Bombardment Group comrades lost during World War II, since the organization was founded in 1975. 
   And while the 303rd Bomb Group Association is meeting this week for the final time, the United States House of Representatives and our great Nation can express its sincerest thanks for their service by carrying forth the mission statement of the 303rd Bomb Group Association and making timeless the memory of their successes and sacrifices by memorializing their history in law.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. House Resolution 293 is a bipartisan bill recognizing the important role of volunteers in local, national, and international communities and their dedication to improving lives, strengthening communities, and fostering civic engagement through service and volunteering. 
   April 15-21, 2007 is recognized as National Volunteer Week. The theme is Inspire by Example, which reflects the power volunteers have to inspire the people they help and to aspire others to serve. 
   Inspire by Example has been the theme throughout our history. We have 61 million volunteers out of a population of 300 million who volunteer some time each day to serve others.  From the very beginning of our time, we have been committed to serving each other. Benjamin Franklin started a volunteer fire department in a library and took care of those in the community, as have others. 
   From the beginning, through war, through disaster and through famine, we have seen the greatest step forward to serve our country. Who could forget the service of the Greatest Generation who came forward in so many ways as others went to war and we saw our own population step up to fulfill the roles in our community and to each other? 
   What do these volunteers do each day of the year? They teach others to read. They care for others who are ill. They work on the forefront for disaster. Right now, in my own State of New Hampshire, which has once again been hit by flood waters, we have volunteers who are out there serving our community. They serve to take care of babies and young mothers. They serve to take care of alcoholics and drug addicts and the most vulnerable in our communities, and they continue their service right through hospice and in senior settings. So we have to thank our volunteers and also recognize what motivates them and to encourage them. That is what this resolution does, to speak to them and to urge them to continue their service. 
   While we have had the greatest numbers at all in the past year, 61.2 million volunteers, we have also had a slight drop. We have to make sure it is possible for volunteers to continue their full-time lives of service in their own jobs and then also in their communities.

   Mr. Speaker, it is a special privilege for me to offer my remarks in support of this legislation and to have an opportunity to share with my colleagues in the House the story of an outstanding young man, a courageous leader, and a brave husband. 
   Jon was born on August 18, 1981. He and his family moved to Hampstead, New Hampshire, 8 years later and quickly grew roots in their community. His mother, Patricia, is the principal at Hampstead Middle School. Jon attended the elite Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated with honors in 1999. He attended Johns Hopkins University where he was commissioned through their ROTC program and graduated in 2003. That's also where Jon met his wife, Jenna, an Army officer in her own right. Tragically, they had only been married 10 months when an IED took Jon and three of his fellow Rangers on a combat logistics patrol in Diyala province. 
   When Jon finished school, he continued a strong family tradition of service to our country. His father was also a Ranger who served in Vietnam. Jon's brother is a West Point and Dartmouth graduate and an Army surgeon at Fort Lewis. 
   For Jon, it was not enough to serve. He excelled, the best of the best. A highly decorated officer, Jon was assigned to 5th Squad, 73rd Cavalry, 3rd BCT of the 82nd Airborne, Fort Bragg. As I said, the best of the best. Among more than a dozen of Jon's medals and honors are the Bronze Star he earned for combat heroism and a Purple Heart. 
   Jon was killed in action on April 7, 2007. He was only 25 years old. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Jenna. Jon was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery alongside three centuries of America's heroes, hallowed ground befitting a hero. We in New Hampshire are lucky to have had time with him and we have been blessed by the life of this wonderful man. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me today in continuing to honor his life by voting to memorialize his service, his dedication to his country and to his family, and his willingness to give his country his own life. Join me in passing S. 2478 for Army Ranger Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh.

   This is not about our soldiers. This is about a failed policy. I think we need to go over some of the facts again, the facts that 70 percent of Americans remember but my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle seem to have forgotten. 
   Number one. There were no Iraqis on the plane that day. 
   Number two. There were no weapons of mass destruction.     
   They weren't there. They were never found.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me time to speak on this important issue. As a cosponsor of H.R. 2693, I rise to express my very strong support of the legislation and to highlight the dangerous philosophy under which the current administration and, consequently, OSHA has been operating. 
   Beside me you see in print the philosophy of ``Guidance'' over standards and regulations. Just to be clear here, guidance is great, but it's terribly dangerous when it comes at the expense of enforceable standards. It is this issue that brings us to the floor today. 
   This Hazard Communications Guidance, which was released just on Monday, starts with a sort of disclaimer paragraph that begins by explaining, ``This guidance is not a standard or regulation and it creates no new legal obligations.'' 
   It concludes with, ``Failure to implement any specific recommendations in this guidance is not in itself a violation of the General Duty Clause. Citations can only be based on standards, regulations, and the General Duty Clause.'' 
   In fact, under this administration, OSHA has issued only one significant new standard, which was on the cancer-causing chemical hexavalent chromium, and this was done under court order. 
   This is an incredibly dangerous philosophy for workers nationwide who rely on the health and safety precautions that OSHA is charged with ensuring. OSHA's obligation to protect these workers is certainly not met by simply enforcing current standards while ignoring emerging dangers. OSHA has responsibility to promulgate new standards and protections as soon as we learn of the hazardous nature of such chemicals as diacetyl. 
   To my colleagues who would say that Congress should step back and let OSHA do its job, I say gladly. We will step back when OSHA steps up and fulfills its obligation to provide meaningful health and safety protections for our Nation's workers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will provide this meaningful protection. It does this by requiring OSHA to issue an interim standard and within 2 years to promulgate a final standard with respect to diacetyl. Our workers deserve this added safety. So do our families that use this product. This bill deserves our support.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, greed has created a financial crisis. I don't believe I have heard one single CEO from Wall Street apologize for the mess they put this country in. But if we are going to help Wall Street, we need to help Main Street as well. 
   This country lost more than 600,000 jobs last year. We need to be investing in our infrastructure so we can create jobs again. We also need to extend unemployment benefits so those who are looking for jobs will be able to pay for their families in the interim. 
   Because of the high energy prices, we are now going to have to provide more fuel heating assistance so that families won't have to choose between eating, or paying their rent, or their mortgage or their bills this month or next month or the next year, while we bail this country out. 
   We have an opportunity, finally, to look at Main Street. While we do this work for Wall Street, let's keep in mind the people of Main Street who pay the bills.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, this conversation is 4 years too late. If we had this conversation 4 years ago, we would have known that we had the wrong intelligence, the wrong country and the wrong war. This administration is now borrowing $10 billion a month with the help of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. If they are truly concerned about fiscal responsibility, $10 billion should catch their attention. We borrow the money. 
   Let's talk about our troops and supporting our troops. If we were to support our troops, first of all we would take them out of a civil war. Secondly, we would care for them while they are here. Third, while they were there, we would make sure that they have the equipment they need. We know this administration has failed on all levels. 
   Our President says we need to listen to the generals. All of the generals are saying that we have weakened our military. 
   Let's support our country and let's support our defense. Make our military strong again so we can practice self-defense.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you for the time, and I thank Chairman Spratt and the Budget Committee for producing a fair and responsible budget, a moral document that is fiscally responsible. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have been deeply concerned about the President's proposed cuts to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program known as LIHEAP. LIHEAP provides critical assistance to millions of families in America. Every winter, tens of thousands of families in New Hampshire rely on this program to heat their homes. Over 40,000 members each year for the past 2 years have applied to the fuel assistance program for help with heating bills. This winter, the average cost of heating a home with heating oil is expected to climb to over $2,000 per family, more than three times the $627 that it cost just 6 years ago. But LIHEAP has not failed to keep pace with the dramatic cost. It has actually dropped.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 162. By doing this, I rise in strong support of our men and women who deserve a pay raise. 
   As part of the Defense authorization, the House passed a 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops, half a percent larger than the President's budget. This means an E-4 would earn $200 a year difference in this, just $200 a year difference, but the President opposed this increase, calling it unnecessary. I don't think it's unnecessary to provide a decent wage for the brave men and women who sacrifice for our country. I once lived on military pay, and I can assure you that a decent wage is a requirement for military men and women and their families. 
   I find it ironic that the President thinks a pay raise for our troops is unnecessary, but he thinks it is necessary to pay contractors billions of dollars with no accountability at all. The President keeps sending our troops back again and again, and the President should at least be willing to give them a decent paycheck to do this job. 
   Madam Speaker, standing up for our troops must also mean standing up for their families. More than half of all servicemembers who are deployed to Iraq are married, and more than 40 percent of them have left children behind. While a half percent increase may seem small, when you're caring for a family, every little bit of support helps. This is not only the right thing to do for our troops; it's the right thing to do for our national security. 
   There is currently a 4 percent pay gap in pay between the military and the private sector. If we want to make sure that our armed services can recruit and retain the best, most talented, most highly qualified people, we need to provide them with comparable pay. This is especially critical now when we face new and emerging threats from around the world. And the Army began this year with the lowest number of recruits signed up for basic  training since the end of the draft in 1973. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, supporting our national security, and supporting our troops and their families by giving them the pay increase they have earned.

   We just need to say a name of a couple of hospitals to understand that the President has not honored the commitments to our troops. This democratically led Congress is honoring commitments. We have passed the greatest budget in history for our veterans. 
   But we have another problem with the President right now. The President wants to give our brave troops only a 3 percent pay increase, and the Democrats are leading the fight for 3.5 percent pay increase. 
   Why is the President refusing to give our soldiers, who are fighting for us, an increase in pay? Only the President and this administration can answer that question.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for the opportunity. 
   I stand here today in strong support of H.R. 3159. As a former military spouse and the proud wife of a veteran, I know how important this is to military families. The President's policies have failed on many levels, but they certainly have failed on the soldiers, the troops who are suffering this great strain right now. 
   I find it ironic that the Iraqi parliament is on vacation for a month while we stand here and tell our troops that they cannot have a break, that they need to stay in the field in the heat and keep fighting the battle for the Iraqis. 
   The Army's available, active duty combat brigades, along with 80 percent of the Reserves and National Guard, have served at least one tour in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the strain is starting to show. 
   Recruiting and reenlistment are down, especially in the Army which has reported about a 7 percent first retention drop, and we're having to offer greater bonuses to attract people. Reports of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress syndrome are up; and this spring the Secretary of Defense announced that active duty soldiers can expect to spend more time in Iraq than they spend at home, with only 12-month breaks between 15-month deployments. 
   We hear a lot of talk from the White House about supporting our troops. That is what this bill does. This bill will support our troops by supporting their right to have a break from combat, and it will support our military families by protecting their rights to spend time with their loved ones. 
   I urge my colleagues, regardless of how they feel about this war and the President's policies, to support H.R. 3159.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, every day, American consumers are being squeezed at the pump. They can no longer afford for Congress to be divided on this issue. 
   I urge every Member of Congress to support legislation on the floor that would compel the oil industry to drill on the public lands it already controls. Big Oil would either have to produce from these lands, would have to show they are being diligent in their development or would have to give up the right to control even more Federal energy resources. 
   Simply put, we are telling Big Oil to either use it or lose it. 
   Experts estimate that 68 million acres of leased land could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil, which would nearly double the Nation's total oil production. 
   Congressional Republicans and President Bush are calling for domestic  drilling, saying it is the only solution to control high prices. Republicans should then be demanding that Big Oil drill on the 68 million acres where they already have leases. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans have been deeply hurt by the prices at the pump. Republicans should join with the Democrats and should tell Big Oil companies to get to work now.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, first let me say that I support the bill in front of us, for these two rivers in Vermont. And I think that it's unfortunate that we can't seem to work on the particular bills in front of us because of the issue that the friends on the other side of the aisle keep bringing up. 
   What I find particularly disturbing is that for 8 years we have had two oilmen in the White House with no energy policy and my colleagues on the other side have sat silent for 2 long years, nothing since I have been here talking about it, 8 years since President Bush has come into office, and suddenly in the waning hours of this session, they are now talking about an energy policy. 
   I certainly welcome them to this. I think we do need an energy policy. I wish they had started talking about an energy policy 8 long years ago. What they allowed to happen in the past 8 years is for us to lose ground on an Apollo-type project to bring a real energy policy to the United States. They have allowed the oil companies to reap the greatest profits in history while they have allowed the American taxpayer to suffer while they subsidize these oil companies. That's just outrageous that they are now at this point 8 long years into it and getting near an election and they're suddenly talking about the lack of an energy policy.     
   Thank you, gentlemen, for bringing this to our attention. We have been speaking about this lack of an energy policy for a long time. 
   I would like to say that their idea of drill, just drill, drill, drill, and we heard it at their convention, drill, baby drill. That is a Fred Flintstone policy. Drill, baby drill, I heard a reporter say, is like people standing there at the edge of the technology revolution yelling, Electric typewriters, electric typewriters. 
   We are now right at the edge of this wonderful, wonderful future for our country. If you decide to join us and invest in an Apollo-type program, a program for energy independence, a program that would allow us to be independent of these nations, to have an economic base here in this country, to create jobs in a green technology, and to have renewables. 
   One of your own party, T. Boone Pickens, who has talked often about, and has run ads, by the way, about the fact that we can't drill our way out of this, that we only hold 2 to 3 percent of the oil and that we are consuming 25 percent. Yet I haven't heard the word ``conserve'' over there until just now. I heard one mention it. 
   We've ignored conservation, we've ignored wind, we've ignored solar, we've ignored all kinds of renewables. And when we have the drill, baby drill plan and drill baby, drill only. Well, you know what? We have simply got to face these issues. We should have faced them 8 long years ago, and we should have faced them when I got here in this 110th Congress. But I certainly welcome you to the debate now. 
   So why don't we do this? Why don't we first take away the subsidies from the oil company and invest in renewables? I think that would be a good start to show Americans that we hear them. Why don't we take the speculators out of the market, since we are all very concerned about the price of energy. I am particularly concerned about what is happening in New Hampshire, where the oil is so high and the winter is coming on us. I am concerned that the President of the United States put in his budget a cut in the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program. 
   So why don't we do this? Why don't we take the speculators out of the market? Why don't we say Drill now, drill, to the oil companies who had 68 million acres and they would not drill on. That would be helpful. 
   There's a number of things that we could have done, and I agree with you that we are at the last moments here, and it's outrageous. But we have the future of America in our hands. We have the ability, as T. Boone Pickens said, to take the wind from--he named Sweetwater, Texas to Hastings, Nebraska--we have great wind capacity, and to take solar from Sweetwater, Texas to California, and catch that. And biomass. And, yes, drilling. Drilling on land and leases that we have. 
   Why didn't you agree to take the leases away if the oil companies wouldn't drill? Why not? Why not do something except stand there with the same, tired drill, baby drill. 
   We are on the eve of this wonderful technology. We have so many people and businesses ready to invest in it. Oil companies certainly have their role. And we are dependent on oil. We are more dependent on oil than we were when George Bush came into office. That's true. But where have you been for 8 long years? 
   I welcome you to this discussion. But I think we should have the discussion in the appropriate place and not block every piece of legislation that is coming through right now, and let's have a comprehensive energy plan. And the first thing the other side could do to show their good faith in this would be to vote against the tax subsidies for the oil companies. If we really want to protect the American taxpayer, why don't we stop forcing them to subsidize oil companies? That would be my first question. Thank you.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 23. I thank the chairman for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was surprised and saddened to learn from a constituent that in spite of the service of the merchant mariners in World War II, none of them received the same benefits that other soldiers received: no access to the GI Bill, no health benefits, nothing. 
   As you consider this bill that will finally show our gratitude to the merchant marines of World War II, I would like to recall the words of General Dwight Eisenhower, who understood what their service had given the United States. In 1944 he had this to say: ``Every marine in this Allied Command is quick to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage and fortitude of the officers and men of the merchant marine. We count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as we do our own; they have never failed us yet and in all the struggles yet to come we know that they will never be deterred by any danger, hardship or privation. When final victory is ours, there is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the merchant marine.'' 
   After the war he noted: ``Their contribution to final victory will be long remembered.'' 
   It is way past time to remember their devotion to the United States. It is way past time to reward them what they earned. Time is slipping.

   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I knew that we had served the American people well when the committee passed this bill and then the House passed it almost unanimously in April 2007. Now, a year later, we are on the verge of sending this important legislation to the President with overwhelming bipartisan support in both Chambers.     
   Science and medicine have made great strides in recent years, especially with regard to genetic mapping and research. The potential for finding the answers we desperately seek for so many diseases and afflictions is greatly increased by the research being done. However, in order for these efforts to be successful, the public must be assured that these new discoveries will help and not hurt them. 
   Science will soon be able to tell us about many more diseases that individuals are genetically predisposed to develop. That information should be used only for the public good. It must not be used by companies to pick and choose who gets insurance or who gets discriminated against. They should not be allowed to charge higher insurance premiums because of somebody's individual genetic makeup. 
   This critical piece of legislation will protect individuals from discrimination. This is an important step that Congress is taking today, and I am very happy that we are doing this in a unified spirit. I commend Congresswomen Slaughter and Biggert for their efforts here. And I would also like to thank Chairman Miller and my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee for their work on this and so many other important issues. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for your leadership in supporting our veterans and particularly on this bill. The 110th Congress has made great strides in fulfilling the promises made to our veterans. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are more than 130,000 veterans in New Hampshire. Those veterans have gone without a full service VA hospital for the past 7 years. Last year, over 700 veterans who visited our VA facility in Manchester for acute care were transported to Boston VA facilities or to the White River Junction in Vermont. For some of our more rural northern residents, this can be an arduous ordeal. Hours can be spent in a car or bus traveling for medical care. 
   To address this inequity, I introduced legislation this week that would require the VA to either provide full-service hospital care or comparable services to veterans in every State. 
   Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us also includes an increase of $200 million in fee-based care funding, care that our veterans can receive in local non-VA medical facilities. This program can provide much-needed assistance to veterans in New Hampshire, and I wanted to receive your assurances that we would continue to work together to ensure that New Hampshire veterans have adequate access to in-State health care. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to my friend and colleague from the Second District of New Hampshire.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the conference report on H.R. 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation; and I thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, and the conferees. 
   I want to highlight two achievements of particular importance to my constituents. 
   The first is a provision that broadens the discretion afforded to school financial aid administrators. It allows them to take into account expenses incurred by families who are caring for an adult dependent when calculating a student's financial aid package. This sounds like a minor technical change, but it is not. 
   A constituent of mine shared a very personal story about her family's struggle to make ends meet while caring for their eldest child, who is a disabled adult, and also trying to send their youngest to college. In determining whether this family qualified for financial aid, an administrator could not take this situation into consideration. With the provision included in this bill, they now can. 
   We have also taken great steps in this legislation to ensure the continued success of the Upward Bound Program. This program plays a very important role in my district helping first generation and low-income high school students achieve their dreams of a college education. These programs have faced challenges over the past year. I am proud we have been able to resolve these issues. 
   We have simplified the FAFSA form and done many other steps. I thank you for your efforts.

Madam Speaker, over the last 6 years, more than 1.6 million American troops have been deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan to implement the Bush administration's military strategy. These troops and their families have really sacrificed, and now the majority of these families believe that the war in Iraq was not worth fighting. 
   The President won't listen to the generals. Perhaps he will listen to the military families. According to a new poll from the LA Times, nearly six out of 10 military families disapprove of the way the President is running the war in Iraq; 58 percent of military families, in general, think we should withdraw within a year, and 69 percent of those who have been in Iraq, their families would like to begin withdrawal within the year. 
   These findings come just days after the Pentagon announced a temporary tour of duty extension for all active  duty soldiers that will keep them deployed for 15 months rather than 12. 
   Madam Speaker, our troops and their families deserve much better than this. Let's ask the President to listen to the generals and listen to the military families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, a while ago the President of the United States looked out in front of a very elite crowd and said to all of them: Some people call you the elite. I call you my base. 
   You know, we should have listened a little more carefully because he really wasn't kidding. They were his base. The President has said ``yes'' to them ever since. Yes to Big Oil. Yes to Big Pharmacy. Yes to anything they want. Yes to tobacco companies. Yes to their tax cuts. And no to the middle class and no to the poor except for one yes. Yes, you can pay for them. 
   And so the President of the United States, with his helpers on the other side, have made it extremely difficult for the middle class and the poor not only to pay for their energy bills, not only to pay for all the other essentials, but now to take their children to the doctor or to the hospital. 
   What is wrong with us that we are having an argument about whether children should be insured and how many children should be insured? 
   I'm a former social worker. Every single day of my life I had stories, tragic stories, stories that should embarrass all of you that you're standing here fighting against these children, and how hard it was for these families to get their prescriptions, how hard it was for them and how they had to decide exactly at what temperature do you take a child to the doctor, at 101, 102 or 103 degrees, because we don't have the money, and so we're not going to take our child to the doctor unless we absolutely must. 
   And yet we stand here tonight and the President tells us that he is going to not allow this program. Why? Why? Because we put a tax on the tobacco company. Shame on all of us that are standing in the way of the children of this country. There's just no excuse for it. 
   And how many children are we talking about? Somebody on the other side said there really aren't that many children, maybe 1 million. Well, the Congressional Budget Office said to the Senate Finance Committee in July or August that there are about 5 to 6 million children. 
   The Democrats are dead on target with this, and the American public knows that and stands with us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to first start out by thanking my distinguished colleague on the Armed Services Committee, Robin Hayes, for his work on this bill and his continued support for the Marine Corps. I would also like to thank Debra Wada and Joe Hicken from the committee staff for their work to bring this to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year, the United States Marine Corps celebrated 232 years of devoted service. This year's celebration, like those of years before, commemorates generations of service to our country and reminds us of their commitment to our freedom and their selflessness. This is an enduring trait of their past, present and future. 
   As soldiers, our marines have fought valiantly to protect democracy and human liberty when those essential freedoms were threatened around the world. In our most dire times, the Marine Corps stepped to the forefront in places like Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam. For those from that generation who are still with us, this resolution celebrates you. 
   As peacekeepers, our marines have stood between rebels and refugees, providing safe haven and aid in the Balkans and to nations in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. To those brave marines, this resolution is for you. 
   As preservists of democracy, marines have protected U.S. and foreign diplomats as they sought to restore peace and stability to war-torn nations. In places like Beirut, they often paid the ultimate price. This resolution is for them. 
   As liberators, Marines were the first conventional U.S. ground forces in Afghanistan, toppling the Taliban government that sheltered al Qaeda and were complicit in the attacks of September 11. Our Marine Corps has lost 40 men and women during Operation Enduring Freedom. This resolution honors them. 
   As heroes, marines have earned the Medal of Honor 298 times, the Distinguished Service Cross 417 times, and the Navy Cross 2,168 times. But they don't do it for the medals or the ribbons. They do it for the people of the United States. To the more than 219,000 marines in the active duty and Reserves, this resolution is for you. Thank you for your service to our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the House has a unique opportunity to clarify the law to protect the financial security of wounded veterans, their families and the families of soldiers who have been killed in the line of duty. As recently as last month, we have heard a number of cases in the media suggesting that the Department of Defense has been requiring soldiers wounded in combat to pay back part of their enlistment bonuses if they hadn't yet served their full term, or even worse, that it would require these benefits to be paid back by the grieving families of soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
   Quite simply, this is wrong. If a soldier signed up to serve our country and is unable to serve out the full team of his or her enlistment due to wounds received in the line of duty, this soldier should not then be asked to return any part of their signing bonus. For a soldier who has faced the hardships and battle and is now facing the challenges of recovery, we should not add the additional burden of paying back money that is rightfully theirs.  
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007, ends the uncertainty about the policy and makes clear that this Nation will never attempt to recoup bonuses and benefits from wounded veterans or grieving families. It mandates that unpaid bonuses or similar benefits are paid in full, and it requires that this financial protection be provided not later than 90 days after the death of a soldier or the departure from the military due to disability from all active duty and Reserve component members. 
   Finally, the act establishes firm guidelines to ensure that the military will act with fairness and equity when handling the question of such bonuses for all servicemembers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire) for his diligence and timely work on this sensitive issue and for his commitment to bring this important legislation to the floor of the House. I strongly support H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007, and urge its immediate adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Guard and in celebration of their 371 years of service. I would like to thank my colleague from Florida, Ginny Brown-Waite, for bringing this measure to the floor. 
   In my State of New Hampshire, the first citizen militia formed in 1623 with the settlement of Portsmouth. In 1679, the New Hampshire National Guard was formally established, marking the humble beginnings of my State's storied tradition of service. 
   Today, nearly 2,700 men and women continue that same tradition of service in the New Hampshire National Guard, and they, too, are distinguishing themselves on the battlefield and at home. 
   In New Hampshire, our Guardsmen routinely perform search and rescue operations. They respond to floods and to ice storms that threaten the region each year. And the New Hampshire Guard joined many other States that answered the call to aid victims from Hurricane Katrina. 
   This story of selfless sacrifice is not unique to the members of New Hampshire's National Guard, but it is one example of how all National Guardsmen put others before self, and their service and sacrifice is honored here in this bill. 
   Today, over 30,000 Guardsmen are serving on the ground and in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan. As we celebrate the National Guard for its 371 years of service, our thoughts are with those men and women who continue to serve bravely overseas and with their families back home. And our hearts are heavy remembering the 483 Army and Air Guardsmen that have given their last great measure of devotion. For them we vow to care for their families and honor their sacrifice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I stand here today in support of this bill. This bill takes care of our military men and women and it also takes care of their families. It provides a raise for the military that is long overdue. It provides for their housing. It takes care of our military and our families. And it cares for those who are injured, especially brain injuries, which we are concentrating on now. 
   It helps rebuild the military. Our military has been weakened by the war in Iraq, and it is now time to support these people. So I am very proud to stand here. 
   It also takes care of the National Guard. It will provide a fourth star for the National Guard so they will have a seat at the table to talk about the policy in the United States. The National Guard deserves this. They also have an increase in the budget of $1 billion. 
   So I am proud here as a member of the Armed Services Committee to lend my support to this and to urge my colleagues to vote for this.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I thank the gentleman, and Madam Speaker. 
   I just came out of an Armed Services hearing where we were discussing, once again, readiness, and we had the Army there telling us the great strains on their budget, the strains on their equipment, and, most importantly, the strains on their soldiers. And so I am standing here today in support of our soldiers, in support of our military, in support of our ability to respond to any crisis in the world. And Iraq is not the place that we need to put our soldiers and all of our resources. 
   Last weekend, I went to Iraq to look for myself what was going on. I saw a lot of contractors taking quite a bit of money, serving soldiers in jobs that soldiers could have done themselves. I saw the strains on the soldiers. I saw National Guard troops that were in for a third deployment. And I saw the difficulty that the Iraqis were experiencing. In flying over Baghdad, I saw a very sad city. 
   Now, what I would like to see happen is for us to take the money that we are pouring into Iraq and put it into Afghanistan where the original trouble started, where we actually had the terrorist training camps, where we still need to finish the business that we started in 2001. But we need money to do that, we need resources to do that. They have been diverted and put into Iraq. 
   There were no Iraqis on the planes that day on 9/11. We went into Iraq because we picked the wrong war, the wrong people, and we should have stayed in Afghanistan and supported the effort there. So I urge my colleagues and I urge the House to do the right thing by our soldiers and by the Iraqis as well, and to make sure that we tend to where the real problems are in Pakistan and also in Afghanistan. 
   I also would like to see some money in homeland security. The first thing we need to do is support our own borders. We need to protect our borders. And when you look at the money that we have put in homeland security, it is miniscule. We are still not checking all of the cargo that comes into the belly of a plane, we are not checking the cargo that comes from overseas. They say that we don't have the equipment. We certainly could have the equipment. Hong Kong checks every single container that comes from abroad. And that is the great worry, that a dirty bomb could come from abroad in a container. We need to use the money wisely. Of course we need defense. We have to invest in our country. But we need to take those dollars and make sure that we are protecting our borders first and foremost, and then also working in Afghanistan; and, making sure that we have enough money and enough resources and enough troops to respond to anywhere else in the world that trouble could brew. Thank you.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I rise today in support of this bill, and I thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for bringing it to the floor and for their great work. I want to also thank Chairman Ortiz and Chairwoman Davis for their work during the subcommittee markup and the committee staff for their hard work throughout the process. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an excellent bill that will have a tremendous impact on our servicemembers and their families, and I am proud to support it. As a former military spouse, I know how much our troops and their families depend on the strong support from Congress. 
   In this year's bill, we grow the military, adding 7,000 soldiers, 5,000 marines, 1,000 sailors, and 450 airmen to take the pressure off the current military. We add a 3.9 percent pay increase and increase existing bonuses. We provide nearly $25 billion for the defense health program without increasing TRICARE fees. We increase benefits for Guardsmen and Reservists as well. These actions are the way that we show that we do support the troops and their families, and this is the way we thank them for their service. 
   We designate money to keep F-22 fighters and C-17s rolling off the production line. These two programs are vital to our Air Force. We add a second Virginia class sub and the resources in our shipyard system to maintain them. We include more than $12 million for cold weather clothing systems that keep our men and women warm in the mountains of Afghanistan. In this year's bill we provide our Army aviation assets with advanced self-protection systems that keep our soldiers safe in harm's way. 
   We also fund programs at home, like the Swimmer Detection Network that protects our Los Angeles and Virginia class submarines at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in my district. We fund military construction projects at our shipyards and depots that are vital to our Nation's defenses, and we add billions for housing at our bases that ensure our servicemembers and their families are safe and comfortable. 
   I am proud that we worked together in a truly bipartisan manner to produce this bill that cares for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and their families. I urge the House to pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I thank the gentleman for bringing this to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of recognizing what our maritime men did for us during World War II. The danger that they lived through, the sinking of their ships, the efforts to protect our other soldiers and bring supplies to them was nothing short of heroic. 
   When I spoke to some of these brave men, I talked about how my father had joined the Navy, and one of the reasons he liked to say was because he always was fed, and he always had ice cream. I never really thought about where all that came from. 
   And then I met a constituent of mine in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, who wrote a letter to me speaking about his father who was a merchant marine and what he had been deprived of after World War II. And here is what Larry Warren had to say. 
   ``I am writing on behalf of all World War II Merchant Marine veterans, but one in particular, my father Fred Warren of Wolfeboro. They need help. 
   ``My father served with the Merchant Marines during World War II. His hearing is damaged from working in the engine rooms, and his lungs are damaged from the asbestos used in the construction of the merchant ships. He survived typhoons in the Pacific, German U-boats in the Atlantic, and Axis torpedo bombers in the Mediterranean. I don't know all the harrowing experiences. He doesn't talk about it. 
   ``He was lucky to have made it home. Many didn't. The casualty rate for World War II merchant marines was one in 26, higher than any branch of the armed services. Merchant Marines fought and died with members of our Armed Forces; some were captured and held POWs. Merchant ships and the crews on them were considered expendable by the Allied leaders. Freedom is not free, and the merchant marines of World War II paid dearly. 
   ``My father has never received help in any form from our government because merchant mariners were denied benefits under the GI bill; no low-interest loans, no unemployment pay, no free college training, no health or prescription drugs, nothing. World War II merchant mariners were not even considered veterans until an act of Congress in 1988. 
   ``I respect all of our veterans and consider them heroes, but I am especially proud of my father. In my eyes, he is a hero, too. It is time to make amends.'' 
   It is time to make amends. It is time to reward these men and their widows for what they have gone through. And we thank them; and there is no better way to thank them first by recognizing through this resolution, and then by recognizing them with the next bill that hopefully will pass through Congress that will provide some financial support and say to them, as we have tried to say to all veterans, ``Thank you very much for saving our country.''

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I was a military spouse and I lived on military pay. It is very difficult to do that. But we do that with honor and with gratitude for the chance to serve this country. 
   The House of Representatives recognizes that service and called for a 3.5 percent increase in pay for the military. The President, who talks about supporting the troops, does not want that. He is strongly opposed to raising the pay of military families. 
   How much does that really mean? For an E-4, it means $200 a year. $200 a year. The President provides $536 billion of tax breaks for the top 1 percent, and is unwilling to give $200 a year to an E-4. Seventy times what we are asking, seventy times, goes to the rich. 
   It is time for the President to start supporting the troops instead of supporting the rich. I hope before Veterans' Day, the President changes his mind and agrees with the House of Representatives that our men and women in uniform deserve this pay.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you for asking that. 
   I come from a family who has served. I had my father serving in World War II. My uncle was a career Air Force officer in several wars. I had a grandfather in war and my brothers who fought, and I also had my husband who was in the military, and I was proud to be a military spouse, and now a member of the armed services; and always I believed that the Commander in Chief was going to be there to protect our troops. Always I thought it would be the Commander in Chief who would be a tough advocate for us all and he would be watching out and speak to other nations in as tough a manner as necessary to protect our troops. That's what I believed. That's why I'm here on the floor tonight. 
   I'm here on the floor trying to understand how the President of the United States has failed these prisoners of war, these men who went to Iraq and were seized by a hostile nation, who were tortured and then had to come back and go to court to receive just compensation. And when they won, then the President of the United States stepped in, not to make sure that they received what they had won, but to make sure they didn't receive it; and that's the part I can't understand. 
   The President said that Iraq needed this money, the Iraqis needed it to rebuild. We give $10 to $12 billion a month to the Iraqi government. I think that the President should take a look at how the money is being spent in Iraq and see and hear the stories that I have heard as a member of the Armed Services Committee and recognize that our money's being wasted over there. And yet he's protecting their assets and protecting them when our troops were the ones who went there. 
   Our troops were the ones who fought for our freedom in that first gulf war, and we had troops who suffered at the end of this government. 
   I can't understand it. And the President was so determined to do this that he held up the authorization bill. Now what is so important about that is there are a lot of programs in there. But one thing in particular just infuriated me. 
   There was a pay raise for our troops, for our troops who were in Iraq right now, who were in Afghanistan and who are all around the world and America protecting us. And the story about the pay raise is relevant, also. 
   The President says he supports the troops, but he only wanted a 3 percent pay raise. And so when Congress voted for a 3 1/2 percent pay raise, the President thought that was too much. He said a 3 percent was sufficient. Obviously, the President has never had to live on military pay, but I have and so many do today. And I know that 3 1/2 percent might not seem like a lot. It certainly isn't. But they need it, and they deserved it, and they earned it. 
   So now we have a problem that today's troops are suffering at the hands of the President's stubbornness here, and then we have the POWs who are suffering because they're not allowed to collect what they justly earned for their suffering. 
   And I can't understand it, but I do know that the people of New Hampshire are furious also that those veterans who went there in complete trust and faith in this country and in the President have to be devastated now to know that if they were injured, if they were tortured abroad, that they could not be certain that the Geneva Conventions would be upheld. They could not be certain that the Commander in Chief would be there for them. They could not be certain that all of the guarantees that were made when they signed and stepped forward to service would be honored, and I think that's the real shame here today and the real disgrace here today that we are not standing up for our soldiers. 
   So I would say that the people in New Hampshire are insistent that those who suffered for our country need to be justly compensated.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Thank you. 
   First, I would like to say that I mentioned that my father's brother had served, and he was in the Air Force. He flew daylight bombing missions over Germany. He talked about the fear during the day flying those bombing missions over Germany, but he never talked about fearing the U.S. Government, that the U.S. Government would not be there for him. 
   Then my brother served in Germany, and my brother-in-law served in Germany. And Germany treated the United States troops very, very well in the 1960s and the 1970s and the 1980s. The reason for that was because we had shown that we were not the kind of country that tortured, that when we received prisoners of war from Germany that we treated them the way we would want to treat any human being. 
   So it was a long distance from my uncle flying over Germany during World War II bombing missions with that great fear about what would happen to him and then the experience that my brother and my brother-in-law had in Germany, welcomed as allies, welcomed with the reputation that we have had of treating our prisoners of war with compassion and with a sense of humanity. 
   My worry now on the Armed Services Committee is that countries that wish to do us harm but might be held back from torturing our individual troops because they have a Geneva Convention to uphold, they will have world  opinion against them, because the world actually believes that we should not torture each other's soldiers. They only understand not only that we have to have some rules of engagement and war and conduct for our POWs, but we also understand that if you don't want anybody to torture your troops, that you have to respond the same way. 
   So we have to hold ourselves to a standard, a standard, by the way, that the United States has led and been proud to show the rest of the world and our own good behavior through history. The world understands that when you receive a U.S. soldier and you torture, you will pay a price; at least that's what they understood before. 
   Our soldiers understood that if they were harmed when they were being held by another nation they would pay that price. So the change now, Congressman, is what does this mean? If we don't have the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, stand up for our troops, what does that mean and how will other nations view this? That's my great worry.

   And then they said, ``You've been back eight or nine times.'' That's right. And we will be back always and forever until we provide health care for working families in America. 
   We want to protect 10 million children and provide health care insurance. They want to protect 6 million. It's as simple as that. What happens to the other 4 million? And in New Hampshire, we would have enrolled 8,000 more children. What happens to the children in New Hampshire and the children of America? Parents will not lie awake at night wondering do they now raid the rent budget or the food budget. Is the child sick enough now to go to the hospital because they don't have health care insurance? 
   Who wanted families in America to make this choice? Not the majority of the House, not the majority of the Senate, not the majority of the Governors, not even the health care industry. But the President vetoed this essential bill, and I'm asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in an override so that the children of America get health care.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, I first want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer and all the Members who are so committed to the SCHIP program. This Congress sent the President very good legislation that would have ensured that millions of low-income children of hardworking Americans could keep health coverage, and it would allow States to enroll millions more who qualified for the CHIP program but aren't covered because the States have not received enough funding. We also had a way to pay for this. 
   But each time, the President has vetoed that legislation, and here in Congress a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to stand with the President blocking the way for this vital program to reach more children. We wanted to insure 10 million children. The President and the Republican leaders only want to insure 6 million children. And that is the crux of the problem here. 
   Today, we will extend the SCHIP program through March of 2009, but an important aspect of these earlier bills is not included. This past August, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a directive to State SCHIP directors effectively informing them that they would no longer be able to insure children in families where incomes exceed 250 percent of the poverty level, $43,000 for a family of three. This is a tragedy, and we will fix it.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for his support on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of our Nation's first credit union. In 1908, St. Mary's Cooperative Credit Association, later to be renamed the Bank of the People, was established in Manchester, New Hampshire. Manchester had textile mills then. The mill workers' resources were pooled to create credit and savings opportunities for workers, many of whom were immigrants. 
   In 1934, 26 years after the establishment of St. Mary's, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Credit Union Act into law, allowing for the organization of credit unions under charters approved by the Federal Government. Today there are over 8,500 credit unions nationwide, and I think it's fair to say that St. Mary's truly laid the foundation for the success of credit unions nationwide. 
   This credit union model has withstood the test of time. From the Great Depression to modern-day globalization, the emphasis on local communities that is embodied in the concept of the credit union has earned these institutions a special place among our Nation's financial institutions. 
   St. Mary's even stayed open during the bank holiday of 1933, providing reassurance and help to its worried community. This commitment to community and access to credit and savings services is easy to see. 
   For example, in 1908, the cost of becoming a member of the St. Mary's Cooperative Credit Association was $5. Today, after 100 years, the cost of signing up for anyone who lives or works in New Hampshire is $5. 
   That is pretty remarkable. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I am proud to honor St. Mary's 100th anniversary, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Res. 1145.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (SAD DAY FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad day for our country. Once again, the President is going to be handed a blank check by the Republicans. Last year the Republicans took a lot longer than the Democrats on this side of the aisle to pass this supplemental. Every year they have given the President exactly what he wanted: a blank check. 
   This time we said to the President twice, we will give the money as long as you meet certain criteria, responsible criteria; and he said, no. He had to have it completely his way, running the war in the fifth year the way he ran it in the first year and the fourth year, without any kind of check, sending our brave troops into battle without the equipment they need. And if they come home injured, failing to care for them and providing for them what they need at home. 
   We tried to give our brave troops a 3.5 percent pay raise. The President said, no. He supports the troops but not financially, not physically and not in the ways that really matter. 
   So here we are approaching Memorial Day, and once again, we are leaving our troops unprotected while they have a political battle about this. And they can't go back to their districts and tell the truth. 
   I will vote against this supplemental because I am voting for the troops.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I have only been here 6 months as a freshman, but I have to tell you that I know America is watching, and I am wondering if our mothers are watching. 
   This is very rude behavior, the calling out, the cat-calling; and I think we understand that the American public sent all of us here to work together. Yes, there have been mistakes. I do recall when they were doing the Medicare part D how the vote was kept open by the majority for 3 hours while the Secretary of Health and Human Services walked up and down the aisle. That wasn't right, so all is forgiven. 
   The point here now is that the American public is watching us. They expect us to get this work done. They expect our behavior to be responsible and respectful. We wouldn't call out like this in a movie theater. We certainly shouldn't be calling out this way in the House of Representatives. I call on all of us to remember our manners.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last comment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am deeply concerned by what I am hearing on the opposite side. And I understand fully the frustration of the American people, having listened to the leadership of this party for so many years distracting Americans from the real issues confronting us. And to hear them attack Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House for using a private airplane to take her back and forth to California, and of that size, is just outrageous. 
   The truth of the matter is that this is the party that completely blocked the 9/11 recommendations that were so critical to the security of this Nation. This is the party that refused to make sure that all the cargo inside the belly of airplanes is inspected. And now, when we have the Speaker of the House, who is rightly concerned about security, using a plane to protect her, and it is absolutely critical that we have this, now they are standing up to speak about this. 
   I am also deeply concerned about the claim that we are not being effective on global warming, because the American people understand this. They have seen the data. They understand it. They want us to move forward in a bipartisan manner. And they want us to stop bickering. 
   And so I plead to all of us to stop the bickering. Let's move on with the legislation.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush has an opportunity to  provide real hope to millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. All he has to do now is reconsider his threat to veto this promising legislation that has recently passed the House. 
   Here in the House we passed, in a bipartisan manner, during the first 100 hours of Congress, legislation that would increase the number of embryonic stem cells eligible for Federal funding. The Senate, in strong bipartisan passion, did exactly the same. Now it has arrived at the President's desk. 
   Last year the President vetoed stem cell legislation, the only issue he vetoed throughout his Presidency. We have a real opportunity finally to solve some of these debilitating diseases. There are 100 million Americans waiting for the President to say ``yes.'' I urge him to reconsider.

   When men and women go to war, they are willing to give their bodies and their lives to this country. When they return, if they are broken, we have the obligation to try to restore them and to care for them and their families as they go about the long process of rehabilitation. 
   Our soldiers deserve a lot more than phrases such as ``support the troops'' and yellow ribbons and visits from celebrities. They deserve the right medical care and a seamless transition going from a military hospital to a veterans hospital for their care. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is what we owe our soldiers and their families. When we talk about  supporting the troops, we honor our commitments to them, and this is a very solid bill that will do just that.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I ran for the rest of us, the bottom 99 percent of us who as a social worker I knew were not getting a fair shake under this administration and its followers. I knew they had created the greatest deficits in American history and that it was the middle class who had been harmed. 
   I stand here with great pride to ask my colleagues in the House to pass this Democratic budget which actually finally represents the middle class. 
   What does this budget do? Unlike the President's own budget proposal, the Democrats' House budget protects middle-class families from a tax increase. Our resolution protects 19 million families against the alternative minimum tax this year and creates a reserve fund accommodating a permanent fix. The reserve fund also will accommodate other middle-class tax cuts, including extending the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the extension of the 10 percent individual tax credit and the elimination of most estate taxes. 
   Compare these middle-class tax cuts to the $500 billion tax increase the President proposed in his budget over the next 10 years. 
   Madam Speaker, this Democratic House is committed to balancing the budget in the next 5 years without raising taxes, and that is what we are going to do here.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I am proud to offer this amendment alongside my colleagues, Representatives Welch, Arcuri, and Hodes, and I thank them for their hard work on this amendment. I would also like to thank Chairman Miller, Subcommittee Chairman Kildee, and Representatives Chandler and Loebsack for their hard work on this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, energy and heating costs are on the rise and communities across the country are feeling the pinch. Now more than ever, it's important to focus on sustainable forms of energy and heating production. Going green is not only the right thing to do for our environment and for national security reasons, but it's the financially responsible thing to do as well. 
   The Shea-Porter/Welch/Acuri/Hodes amendment builds on the positive steps taken in H.R. 3021 by specifying that the funds authorized by this act may be used to invest in sustainable solutions that meet the energy and heating needs of our Nation's school facilities. Sustainable solutions such as geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass technologies will help to mitigate the costs of the increasing traditional energy sources on our schools by reducing the schools' dependence on traditional sources. This amendment makes a simple change, but it is an important one, as it serves to provide school districts with greater flexibility in the use of these dollars. 
   Madam Chairman, 82 percent of the 475 public schools in my home State of New Hampshire were built prior to 1981, and 36 were built prior to 1951. Just think of all the advances that have been made in heating and energy efficiency technologies since then. The underlying legislation will certainly help modernize these schools, and with our amendment, H.R. 3021, will do even more by allowing school districts to make critical investments in sustainable heating and energy solutions. 
   Madam Chairman, the Shea-Porter/Welch/Arcuri/Hodes amendment is supported by the National Education Association, and it deserves the support of our colleagues as well. I urge a ``yea'' vote on this amendment and the underlying legislation. Let's invest in our school infrastructure in an environmentally and economically sound way.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, as Senator Grassley wrote in a letter to The Washington Post, it's fine to have a philosophical debate over the merits of this program, but opponents should be intellectually honest about what the bill does and does not do. 
   Despite this, the President and a few supporters are still clinging to a series of distortions and spin to try to mislead the public. The President keeps talking about families earning as much as $83,000. If this were true, I would have voted against this program. And as for the exception for New Jersey, the $72,000 was requested by a Republican Governor and approved by President Bush's administration. Some of the President's supporters have claimed we didn't provide a way to pay for this bill, but we did. As Americans, we want our children to be healthy and productive. 
   The irony did not escape me that while the President was attacking SCHIP, I was sitting in a hearing of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member. The topic was waste and fraud in Iraq, billions of dollars. Like I said, the irony did not escape me, and it did not escape most Americans. 
   We must override this veto.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise as a proud sponsor of this amendment, the Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Protection Act. The bill will provide job protection to the brave men and women who volunteer their time as firefighters and EMTs during national disasters. 
   Some volunteers put their lives on hold to help others. Others literally put their lives on the line. 
   When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, our Nation's emergency services were overcome by the immensity of the disaster. Almost 400,000 people were displaced from their homes. The images of this tragedy will be seared in our minds forever. 
   In the aftermath of the hurricane, I went down to do a very small part to help those, and I saw the devastation. But in a disaster of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina or the recent tragedy in Kansas, we need more than an extra pair of hands. When our Nation's emergency services are overwhelmed, we need highly skilled professionals who can step in to provide such help. 
   More than 800,000 skilled first responders volunteer for such emergencies each year. Volunteer firefighters and emergency medical technicians, EMTs, are a critical part of this effort. They are fighting fires and providing essential medical care. They are saving lives. 
   But, under current law, when volunteer firefighters and EMTs return to their homes, there is no guarantee that they will still have their jobs. They can do the right thing for America and find out they are left out in the cold. In effect, when disaster strikes, these first responders are forced sometimes to decide between helping others and having the security of knowing they still have their jobs when they go home. 
   This amendment would change all that. It would guarantee volunteer firefighters and EMT the right to keep their job when they respond in a national emergency and allow them to volunteer 14 days per calendar year when they act in an official capacity. 
   Our Nation absolutely needs highly skilled professionals who are willing to leave their homes and their jobs to help save lives. Congress can help support our volunteer firefighters and EMTs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

And then I watched my father struggle, through three major illnesses, with insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies.

And do not believe for a moment that things are better now, because my mother also receives prescription drugs and struggles with the cost and worries about what is happening to the money that she has left.     
   I urge my colleagues to please support this bill. It is a beginning. It is the voice of the people, the voice of the taxpayers. 
   Who sits at the table right now with the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies while they negotiate? We don't. The taxpayer cannot sit at the table. But if my colleagues pass this bill, the American taxpayer, the seniors and all those who require these drugs will finally be represented.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I thank Chairman Miller for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. Last year, the Democratically led 110th Congress cut interest rates on student loans in half over a 5-year period in order to help American families pay for college. 
   This year we have continued our commitment to the poor and to the middle class by expanding college access. College loans are getting more expensive. By working and through student loans, I was able to attend college full time, but today, many students can only attend part time because of financial or family obligations. They also have to attend summer sessions so they can get through college more quickly. This legislation will help them by expanding Pell Grant eligibility for these part-time, year-round students. 
   One of this Congress' priorities is to make it easier to earn a college education. This legislation honors our commitment. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I proudly support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF PETTY OFFICER NATHAN H. HARDY -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and sacrifice of a patriot, Chief Petty Officer Nathan H. Hardy of Durham, New Hampshire, who was killed in action on Monday, February 4, while serving with the Navy SEALs in Iraq. Nate died doing what he loved. He loved our great country, and his life serves as an example to my State of New Hampshire and to our country. 
   We also honor the bravery and sacrifice of Chief Petty Officer Michael E. Koch of State College, Pennsylvania, who was killed alongside Nate in Iraq on Monday. They were brothers in arms and will not be forgotten. 
   After graduating from Oyster River High School in Durham, New Hampshire, Nate enlisted in the Navy on November 4, 1997, with the ambition to become a Navy SEAL. He graduated from boot camp at Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes, Illinois, in January 1998 and in the same month entered Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training in Coronado, California, Class 221. 
   Nate was a stellar SEAL, and he lived the life of a SEAL each day. His military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, three Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Medals, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, three Sea Service Deployment Awards, NATO Medal, the Expert Rifle Medal, and the Sharpshooter Pistol Medal. 
   Beyond being a remarkable SEAL, Nate was a loving husband, a happy new father, a dedicated son, a loyal friend, and a role model to many in New Hampshire and across the country. Nate embodied the ethic of Cincinnatus who, when called upon to serve and defend Rome, gave all of his effort and determination; but when conflict ended, he returned home to enjoy his family and friends. He did not glorify himself as a hero, because true heroes do no such thing. He was as humble as he was brave. 
   Like Nate, I graduated from Oyster River High School in Durham. Ours is a close-knit community and Nate and his family have played an integral role in its unique camaraderie. I've spoken to many of his friends, and it's clear they will always miss him, but each will carry a piece of him forever. Because he had a passion for so many varied interests, including sports, art, books and music, Nate touched people in different ways. Each one of his circles of friends has a unique perspective on Nate that they call their own because of his eclectic interests. All of them, though, will always feel his love, celebrate his life, and remember his great passion for living. 
   In addition to his friends, Nate leaves behind his brother, Ben; his mother, Donna, an administrative assistant at the University of New Hampshire; his father, Steve, a professor at UNH; his wife, Mindi; and 7-month-old son, Parker. The community was called upon to support the Hardy family when their eldest son, Josh, died after waging a long battle against cancer in 1993. The Hardys showed courage at that time, and Durham rallied to their support. The community is ready to support them again at this time, united by the memories of this remarkable young man. 
   Mindi and Parker are especially in our hearts at this time and will always be, even after the immediate pain recedes. 
   Down the street from this hallowed floor is the Department of Veterans Affairs. On its side stand President Lincoln's words: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.'' 
   Our patriot, Nate, bore the battle and the people who cared so deeply about Nate will now care for Mindi and Parker. Friends and family will share stories with his wife and son, stories that they will carry in their hearts forever. Parker will know not only that his father was brave, but that his father was a good man, a man of character and conviction. 
   Nate Hardy enriched our New Hampshire and our country. We were blessed to have him, even for such a short while. May he rest in peace, and may his family find comfort in knowing that he was loved and respected by all.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (DISCUSSING THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, it has been 4 years and we are now in our fifth year of war, and once again the Nation stops to assess where are we? And probably the best indicator of where we are was the front page of the Washington Post today.     
   The first article, ``CIA Said Instability Seemed Irreversible.'' That is the instability in Iraq. 
   Second article, ``White House Gives Iraq Mixed Marks in Report.'' Unfortunately, Iraq did not meet any of the benchmarks set by the Bush administration and the Congress. 
   Third article, ``U.S. Warns of Stronger al Qaeda.'' What we are talking about there is the resurgence of al Qaeda in Pakistan and in Afghanistan where it is no longer safe for girls to go to school once again, and where the drug crop is stronger than ever and where we have made no gains at all. Why haven't we made any gains after 4 years? Because we have been dragged into Iraq, into a war without end, by a President who did not understand the region, who is indifferent to the problems, the cultural differences and the problems they are experiencing, and who has not listened to the world. He has not listened to America, and has not listened to his generals and advisors on this. 
   Now they are asking us for more time. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, there is nothing that upsets me more than hearing somebody stand and ask for more time after 4 long years; more time for the surge, I heard today, that the surge hasn't had time to work. My question to the gentleman was: Which surge are we talking about? I lose track because we have had so many surges. Which surge are we talking about? 
   Then they say that the President needs more time. Then I hear General Petraeus needs more time. Always we need more time. 
   How about this. We have a democracy, a young democracy, the President says, in Iraq, and more than half of the people in that parliament signed a petition asking the United States to leave. Now we said we would leave if another nation like Iraq asked us to leave. And yet we hear absolute silence from the President. He will not leave despite of the fact that the government he had elected there has asked us to leave. 
   It costs us $10 billion a month. When I speak to my constituents, they are all asking, why don't we have money have money for this? We need money for health care. We have a problem with infrastructure. And we just don't have the money for this; this program is being cut back. And my answer over and over is what everybody else is having to tell the good people in this country who need our resources, this is what we have to tell them, you can't have two wars, tax cuts for the top 1 percent, the greatest deficits in history, and still provide for the American people. 
   We have a decision to make. We have an opportunity finally to provide a responsible road map out of Iraq; and yet we have a President and an administration that is indifferent to this road map.  
   It is now our responsibility to respond to the American people, to respond to the world and try once again to get the President's attention and once again to ask to please end the craziness here after the thousands of deaths of American soldiers, the injuries which we will be paying for, and should pay for. It is our obligation to honor our commitments to our soldiers, but we will be paying for this for so many years. And we also have an obligation to the Iraqis. We don't even know how many have died because we don't really count them. 
   What we do know about Iraq is that that culture has been decimated, that those who can leave have left. The countries surrounding Iraq have a large number of refugees, and people living inside Iraq are afraid to go out on their streets. 
   When I was in Iraq in March, I had an opportunity to speak to Sunni and Shiite women. It was very clear to me that they were unable to resolve their differences. They were so full of mistrust and hatred for each other that they were in the midst of a civil war. Yet we stay there and we continue to put our soldiers in the middle of a civil war, and we continue to be deaf to the cries of the rest of the world. 
   So we are standing here tonight asking once again for the President to listen to the American people, to listen to reason, to listen to the military leaders who never talk about a military victory any more. They simply talk about stabilizing Iraq, and the question has to be stabilizing Iraq; wasn't Iraq stable 4 years ago? Is this the result we get after 4 years of war? 
   I thank our soldiers for their incredible commitment to this country. I have had an opportunity to see some of them leave. I have nothing but the deepest respect for them. I know that the Army is suffering under the strain of a 4-year war. The soldiers and their families are suffering under the strain. I know that they have asked us to speak up for them because they are unable to. 
   So we stand here once again tonight for the people, for the soldiers, and ask the President to please start a responsible road map out of Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (DISCUSSING THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. It's very important. I sit on the Armed Services Committee and the Subcommittees on Personnel and Readiness. So I hear every day what the President's impact has had on personnel and on readiness. I would like to address both of them. 
   Supporting the troops is a lot more than putting a yellow ribbon on a car. The ``Support the Troops'' sound coming out of the White House rings hollow to my ears after 6 months on the Armed Services Committee. I will give you an example. Here we have the most wonderful troops in the world, committed volunteers who signed up out of love and patriotism for their country. It came time for a pay raise, and the President only wanted 3 percent. 
   The House of Representatives, bipartisan, said they wanted 3.5 percent pay raise. So, how much is 3.5 percent versus the President's percent? Well for an E-4, it would be $200 a year. I know, from sitting on the Personnel Subcommittee, what a strain this is on their families and the cost of having a loved one gone and having to get day care and having to get extra help and not having the same support system that they have when they have their spouse or family member with them. 
   Yet the President said 3 percent was sufficient. He was angry enough, when the House voted for a 3.5 percent pay raise, that he listed it as one of the reasons that he would consider vetoing the bill. If you can't give an E-4, who is serving his or her country, $200 a year, then all the talk you want about supporting the troops is hollow, and it really ranks sour for the rest of us. 
   You look at readiness, and you realize the Army has been so impacted by this, that I actually voted to grow the size of the Army. I also voted for the largest, we all did, the largest military budget in history. 
   As a direct result of the President's misguided policy, he has left us in such a weakened state around the world, that we have to grow the size of the Army. We have to put more incentives in there, and we have to put the largest budget in there. 
   You know, we do have enemies in this world. We know that. We have a lot of enemies. They weren't in Iraq, but we do have enemies. 
   Peter Pace, a general, was asked if he were comfortable with the ability of the United States to respond to an emerging threat around the world. He paused for a moment, and he said, no, I'm not comfortable. That should frighten all of us. 
   If the general doesn't feel that we could respond to an emerging threat because all of our resources and all of our treasure and all of our people are planted inside of Iraq, we have a real problem. This is why we had to have that vote today, and this is why we need to get out of this war. 
   You know, I have been very disturbed by the way it has been treated like a political issue. It's not. 
   The freshman class that came here to make the change have been going to Iraq at great personal risk to themselves to have a look and to be sure that they are right about their position against this war. One by one we have come back, as you know, and said, no, we were right about this. What we saw was horrific. We saw a very sad, destroyed country. We saw a country at war with itself in Iraq, and we saw our troops stuck in the middle of the civil war. 
   Fortunately, there are some Republicans who are now breaking away from the President's grip and speaking the truth about this war. I just wanted to read a couple of them. I will leave their names out, because who they are is not important, except to say that they are Senators. 
   Here's one, ``We need to be fighting terrorists, not civil wars ..... Iraq's peace is one they must win on their own. We cannot win it for them. Our might should be focused on stopping terrorists who are plotting to bring harm to the United States.'' 
   Here is another Republican Senator, ``A policy of responsible military disengagement with a corresponding increase [in] nonmilitary support is the best way to advance our Nation's interests.'' 
   Another one, ``There's nothing to wait for. Almost everybody that has any knowledge of the reports ..... would indicate they are not going to show any degree of a big change that we needed. So we are just wasting time.'' 
   If we are going to fight terrorism, first of all, we need to protect our own homeland. 
   You know, if you know there is a burglar in the neighborhood, first thing you do is lock your own door. We didn't do that. If you look at the little money we have invested in Homeland Security, you will know that we are no safer than we were before 9/11, that we took the money and we went to Iraq. 
   Now why did we go to Iraq? I guess that's the question that hangs in everybody's mind. There were no Iraqis on the plane that day. There was no evidence that Iraq was ready to attack us. We were misled, misguided, got into this war. What's happened to us? Are we safer here? No, of course not. 
   Are we in more danger there? Yes. Have we destabilized the region? Yes. Do we have to worry about growth of al Qaeda? Yes. 
   However, the good news is, yesterday at a hearing on global security, there was a Member of the CIA and a couple of others who spoke, and they said that we do not have to fear Iran's sway over Iraq. 
   Let's remember, Iran and Iraq were bitter enemies who fought an 8-year war. They are not natural allies. They are only allies right now because of us. Once we leave, it's my fervent hope and belief that it will calm down.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the National Counterterrorism Center recently issued a report entitled, ``Al Qaeda Better Positioned to Strike the West.'' This report concludes that al Qaeda has reorganized, regrouped, and is stronger now than it has been in years. 
   Yesterday, in the Armed Services Committee, we heard testimony that al Qaeda has established itself in the mountains along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and is operating with relative impunity. On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says he has a gut feeling we will be attacked this summer. 
   For years, Democrats have been saying we need to focus our efforts on combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the President took our brave soldiers and our resources to Iraq. Now it appears that the President's disastrous policy of ignoring the real threats and bogging our military down in Iraq has borne fruit. The area and the country is destabilized and more dangerous to their neighbors and to us. Thanks to the President's policy, our military is now overextended, our Nation is deep in debt, and our international reputation is stained. 
   This cannot be allowed to continue. We are America the beautiful. We are the greatest country on Earth. We are the beacon of light and hope. We need to withdraw from Iraq, place our soldiers in a place where they can respond to any terrorist threats, and protect our borders as we once again reclaim our moral reputation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Chairman, as a former social worker and administrator and a cosponsor of the GIVE Act, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 2857. 
   I was able to see firsthand the hard work and self-sacrifice and dedication of our AmeriCorps volunteers during the Katrina recovery effort. As a relief volunteer myself, I worked side by side with the AmeriCorps volunteers. You can't say enough about these young people who gave of themselves and worked tirelessly for many, many hours to give comfort to their fellow Americans. This convinced me how essential AmeriCorps and other national service programs really are to this Nation. 
   My experiences as a social worker and as an administrator and relief volunteer have made the reauthorization of this program a high priority for me, and I'm proud that it's a high priority for this Congress as well. 
   I'm also grateful that the committee passed my amendment to increase the minimum amount of the State formula grants. This increase acknowledges that these volunteer programs are equally important in smaller States such as New Hampshire. These programs and the participants who are in them work miracles for very low money, and we need to thank them.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (GENERALS AGREE THAT PRESIDENT'S TROOP ESCALATION PLAN IS NOT BEST WAY AHEAD -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue today to debate a resolution on the floor voicing this Congress' opposition to the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq, I think it is important that we stress that Congress is not alone in opposing the President's escalation. 
   First of all, it is critical that we remember that the people of Iraq do not wish us to be in their country. They wish to sort this out themselves, and we need to honor that. But retired and current military leaders in our country have also expressed their opposition to this plan. 
   Retired General Barry McCaffrey described the President's plan as a ``fool's errand.'' Retired General Wesley Clark said, ``Without such fundamental change in Washington's approach, there is little hope that the troop surge, Iraqi promises, and accompanying rhetoric will amount to anything other than stay the course more.'' And this from Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, the commander of the Multinational Corps in Iraq: ``It's clear that you cannot solve this problem militarily. You have to have the combination of military, economic and diplomatic things that we need to do.'

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'd like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman DeFazio for working with me on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is critical that we take a serious look at our Nation's bridge infrastructure and take the necessary steps to ensure that we invest in the maintenance and modernization of that infrastructure. The underlying legislation accomplishes this, and I applaud the chairman for his work on this and look forward to voting for this bill when the time comes. 
   However, whenever possible, we must take care to protect our Nation's historic bridges, while ensuring their safety. My amendment accomplishes this by allowing States the option to provide for more frequent and in-depth inspection of historic bridges, in lieu of their replacement under the 5-year performance plan outlined in this underlying legislation.  
   Under my amendment, the safety of these historic bridges is ensured by requiring that States choosing to take advantage of this exception subject these bridges to more vigorous inspections. At the same time it also makes approval of the exception contingent upon the Secretary's determination that the overall safety of the State's bridge inventory will be increased by granting the exception. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is by no means a blanket exception for historic bridges, as it rightfully puts safety first. But it does provide the necessary flexibility for those States that wish to preserve their historic bridges. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (INCREASED FUNDING FOR LIHEAP MUST BE A NATIONAL PRIORITY -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, it may be July, but New Hampshire families are already worried about how are they going to heat their homes this winter. The cost of heating oil has been rising dramatically all year. With $5 a gallon heating oil forecast, the average New Hampshire family could be spending $4,000 to heat their homes. This is a daunting figure for most families. 
   With so many households relying on heating oil and with the Bush administration recommending a $500,000 cut to the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, for fiscal year 2009, Congress simply must step in and provide the kind of funding relief Americans need. 
   I have introduced legislation that would provide $9 billion in emergency funding for LIHEAP, as well as an additional $1 billion for weatherization programs. Not only would this proposal ensure that Northern States receive increased aid to get through the long winter, but it would also help the Southern States get through their hot summers. 
   Increased funding for LIHEAP must be a national priority. The administration's effort to slash funding is absolutely inexcusable. Congress must step in and provide adequate funding.

   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise today in strong support for the men and women of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has prepared a detailed capital improvement program that elevates their shipyard from the gold standard to the platinum standard. It will ensure that the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is prepared to meet future challenges required of the Navy's long-term ship repair vision. I support this long-term capital investment strategy and believe that it is incumbent on the Congress to support all of our public shipyards and, most importantly, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Capital Improvement Program. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).

<DOCNO>Ms. SHEA-PORTER. (NO BLANK CHECK -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, as Wall Street was struggling last week, the Bush administration reached out to Congress and asked for help. But over the weekend, the Treasury Department sent just a 3-page bill to Capitol Hill that was nothing more than a blank check for Secretary Paulson, $700 billion that the Secretary could use at his discretion. 
   That is simply not acceptable. We are not going to hand over a $700 billion check so the administration can do what they wish. 
   Over the next couple of days, we will work in a bipartisan fashion to develop legislation that includes independent oversight so that we can see exactly what the Treasury Department is doing with this money. We also want to ensure that CEOs are not rewarded with golden parachutes for the mess that they created. 
   A blank check is not acceptable. Congress will work to protect the American taxpayer.
