<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of the City of Brunswick, one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families'' in the United States. 
   The City of Brunswick has been recognized by Family Circle magazine from over 1,850 communities as one of the ``10 Best Towns for Families.'' But this is hardly a surprise for anyone who lives there. 
   With family-friendly neighborhoods and child-friendly parks, like Mooney Park, where hundreds of boys and girls fill summer evenings playing baseball and softball, we have long known that Brunswick is one of the best towns for families. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the rest of America will know about the vision Brunswick's community leaders and their citizens have pursued to create a community of excellence. 
   Communities throughout this Nation can look to Brunswick for examples of how to green their communities. With their Tire Adoption program, over $25,000 was raised to recycle 20,000 tires, converting old junkyard into park land. 
   In addition, the Brunswick Art Works recently held the second annual Eco-Arts Chalk Festival in North Park. At this event, children not only competed in chalk art sidewalk drawing contests, but they also made their own rain collection barrels out of recycled plastic drums. 
   Let us not forget that the Nation's first LEED-certified grocery store calls Brunswick, Ohio in the Brunswick Town Center its home. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I am so pleased to honor Brunswick, Ohio, part of my district, as one of the 10 best towns in America for families.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on this amazing legislation. Consumer product safety is not an area that we can afford to ignore, and this historic legislation that we're passing today is a tremendous victory for consumers. 
   This year dangerous toy and product recalls are happening at an unprecedented rate. I remember just a couple of months ago reading a story in my local paper about possible lead contamination and the paint on plastic Easter eggs. That is unacceptable. 
   For far too long we've been reading story upon story about dangerous toys and contaminated food. Imports from foreign countries continue to grow, and many manufacturers from foreign countries fail to adhere to even basic safety standards. 
   The American people should not have to worry about the safety of the products they use or the toys that they give their children to play with. Last year, more than 25 million toys were recalled  in the U.S., and 80 percent of all toys sold in the United States are imported from China. 
   This relationship between the growing import safety crisis and American trade policy is notable and requires us to strengthen our oversight here at home. To do that, the Consumer Product Safety Commission needs to have the resources to help protect our families and then they need to do it. 
   Our bill strengthens the CPSC and ensures American families are protected from dangerous toys, and this legislation bans lead beyond a minute amount in many products, creating the toughest lead standard in the world. 
   Madam Speaker, my constituents deserve to know that their government is doing everything it can to keep their families safe. Today with passage of this bill, we are upholding that responsibility. 
   I thank you again, Chairman Dingell, and your committee for all of your hard work, and thanks to Speaker Pelosi for making this issue a priority. I also want to express my appreciation to Representative BOBBY RUSH for his commitment and his leadership in bringing this legislation to fruition. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important work.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin this hour by talking about a subject that has become one of the most significant issues of our time. I am going to be joined by members of the freshman class or the Majority Makers throughout this hour to talk about Iraq. 
   We have heard in recent days about what the President's idea of our way forward is. He has called for more money and more patience and a renewed commitment to U.S. troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, another stay-the-course strategy that puts us on a path toward a $1 trillion, at least 10-year presence war in Iraq. On top of that, we have no convincing evidence that the political reconciliation necessary will be achieved even after so much sacrifice on the part of our brave troops will be realized. 
   I believe that the President's plan for Iraq amounts to an open-ended and dangerous commitment of American troops in Iraq and an open wallet from the American people to pay for it. 
   The question should not be whether we keep our troops in Iraq for 10 years. The question should be: How do we responsibly redeploy our troops? And how do we develop that plan that will do so while we continue to protect our homeland and fight against terrorists? 
   On August 19, we saw in the New York Times an editorial that was written by seven brave U.S. soldiers. I bring this to the attention, Mr. Speaker, of you and all those who may be tuned in because I think it is important that we listen to their vantage point. And while I won't be reading the entire article, I will read excerpts from it. Again, it is August 19, the New York Times, and I would suggest that everybody who can take a look at the complete editorial. It is entitled, ``The War As We Saw It.'' And it begins: 
   ``Viewed from Iraq at the tail end of a 15-month deployment, the political debate in Washington is indeed surreal. Counterinsurgency is, by definition, a competition between insurgents and counterinsurgents for the control and support of a population.     
   To believe that Americans, with an occupying force that long ago outlived its reluctant welcome, can win over a recalcitrant local population and win this counterinsurgency is farfetched. As responsible infantrymen and noncommissioned officers with the 82nd Airborne Division soon heading back home, we are skeptical of recent press coverage portraying the conflict as increasingly manageable and feel it has neglected the mounting civil, political and social unrest we see every day.'' 
   And then they say, in parentheses, ``Obviously these are our personal views and should not be seen as official within our chain of command.'' 
   They continue: 
   ``The claim that we are increasingly in control of the battlefields in Iraq is an assessment arrived at through a flawed, American-centered framework. Yes, we are militarily superior, but our successes are offset by some failures elsewhere. What soldiers call the `battle space' remains the same, with changes only at the margins. It is crowded with actors who do not fit neatly into boxes: Sunni extremists, al Qaeda terrorists, Shiite militiamen, criminals and armed tribes. This situation is made more complex by the questionable loyalties and Janus-faced role of the Iraqi police and Iraqi army, which have been trained and armed at United States taxpayers' expense.'' 
   And then they continue: 
   ``Reports that a majority of Iraqi army commanders are now reliable partners can be considered only misleading rhetoric. The truth is that battalion commanders, even if well meaning, have little or no influence over the thousands of obstinate men under them in an incoherent chain of command who are really loyal only to their militias.'' 
   They continue in this article, and they state, ``Political reconciliation in Iraq will occur, but not at our insistence or in ways that meet our benchmarks. It will happen on Iraqi terms when the reality on the battlefield is congruent with that in the political sphere. There will be no magnanimous solutions that please every party the way we expect, and there will be winners and losers. The choice that we have left is to decide which side we will take. Trying to please every party to this conflict, as we do now, will only ensure we are hated by all in the long run.'' 
   These brave soldiers conclude this op-ed with the following: 
   ``It would be prudent for us to increasingly let Iraqis take center stage in all matters, to come up with a nuanced policy in which we assist them from the margins but let them resolve their differences as they see fit. This suggestion is not meant to be defeatist, but rather to highlight our pursuit of incompatible policies to absurd ends without recognizing the incongruities.'' 
   They say, ``We need not talk about our morale. As committed soldiers, we will see this mission through.'' 
   I share that because I think it's worth having out there for our consideration and our contemplation to add to the wealth of information that is being presented to the American people. 
   I'm sad to report that since this op-ed began, they started writing this, during the course of writing it, one of these brave soldiers was shot in the head, and he is recovering. But on September 13, the headline in the same New York Times sadly stated, ``Skeptical But Loyal Soldiers Die in a Truck Crash in Iraq.'' And two of these soldiers who had the courage not only to go and fight for our Nation but to do everything they were asked to do were killed in Iraq. 
   We are here today to talk about this pressing, pressing issue. The light that  has been shed on this by these soldiers should be part of the discussion. I am joined here on the floor right now by a couple of my colleagues, leaders on this issue, I know, who feel it deeply. The gentleman from Florida, RON KLEIN, a tremendous new Member, at this point I am going to just yield to him for his remarks.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Congressman Klein. 
   I couldn't agree more that we need to have that kind of a plan. And unfortunately, a plan for responsibly redeploying and a plan for dealing with the broad scope of protecting America and what's in America's best interest is not being offered up. In fact, it's not even being discussed, because we're having the same discussion that we've been having for years now about staying the course in Iraq. 
   I would like to shift it over to my colleague from New Hampshire, Representative Carol Shea-Porter, who I know can shed a great deal of light on this as well as a member of the Armed Services Committee.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Representative Arcuri. That firsthand account and your observations are very enlightening. We appreciate you bringing them forward and, again, highlighting the fact that as we make this choice and as the President opts to try and keep us in Iraq for 10 years, or beyond, it means there are other consequences. Beyond all of those other consequences we talked about militarily and the effects on our military, there are those domestic issues, Representative Shea-Porter, that you point out and Mr. Arcuri points out that we will continue to fall behind on. I think that the picture is becoming a little bit more clear down here tonight that we need some comprehensive thinking that is smart and effective. And the question of a responsible redeployment and what that plan should look like is really the one that we need to be working on. 
   With that, I want to pass it over to another great Member of the new Congress, a freshman from Minnesota who I think is going to shed some light on the Blackwater situation.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (MAJORITY MAKERS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Well, I thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. It is a sad state of affairs, but it goes back to the point that we have heard here tonight, and that is that unity in Iraq, really, at the end of the day, is going to be determined by the people of Iraq. We all know that our military has performed valiantly and selflessly and that they are true American heroes. But as you point out, it is not fair to keep them trapped in the middle of a civil war and refuse to acknowledge that all that has been discussed here tonight is going on. That is not a prudent plan. I think it is time. We have heard the call when we go home and talk to our constituents. It is time for a plan to responsibly redeploy. That is what the American people need from our President. 
   I will share just a few statistics with you that sort of buttress this need. We know that there was a great rollout when we had this so-called surge introduced as a new way forward. But let me just shed some light on some of the results. In June, July and August of 2007, it marked the bloodiest summer so far U.S. troops in Iraq have had, with 264 soldiers killed. U.S. casualties in Iraq are 56 percent higher this year than they were at this time in 2006. Since January of this year, we have lost 761 brave servicemen and women to the war in Iraq. 
   By the way, I should say that these statistics are as of September 10. I have fear they have grown since then. As of September 10, 3,759 U.S. troops have been killed and more than 27,770 have been wounded in Iraq since it began in March 2003. Think about that. Think about the cost in lives. Think about the cost in the casualties and the injuries that our soldiers are facing for the rest of their lives in many cases, the costs to them, which is unfathomable and enormous, and the cost to the American people as we do what we must do, and that is provide them with the health care and the resources they need and to fulfill the promise that we make to them when we send them into harm's way. We must take care of our veterans. 
   We also learn that, and you pointed this out, Representative Shea-Porter, that in Iraq, opinions are also that they would like our troops to be responsibly deploying. Just to share some information from a new poll that was jointly conducted and released by ABC News, BBC News and Japan's NHK, 47 percent of Iraqis want American forces and their coalition allies to leave the country immediately. That is a 12 percent increase over March. Remember, our soldiers are there in that environment. The polls showed that every person interviewed in Baghdad and Anbar province, a Sunni-dominated area where Bush recently visited and cited progress, said the troop increase has worsened security. Seventy percent believe security has deteriorated in the areas where the U.S. surge troops were located. Between 67 and 70 percent say that the surge has hampered conditions for political dialogue, reconstruction and economic development. Fifty-seven percent of Iraqis say that attacking coalition forces is ``acceptable,'' more than three times higher than when polled in February of 2004. That is the environment we are keeping our troops in. The President's plan is to do so for the very foreseeable future. 
   It is time for a plan of responsible redeployment. Our military should not be asked to try to control a civil war, a sectarian civil war. We have heard all  the components of all the factions and all the dynamics that are going on in Iraq. Just think about our troops sitting in the middle of that and doing everything they are asked to do. We know from the report that Representative Shea-Porter referenced, and we know from the GAO reports. They confirm that our strategy is not working and that this conflict begs for a political solution, not a military one; though the United States can play a constructive role, and we will, and we have done so by providing, through high cost and blood and money, an opportunity to embrace a different way to the Iraqi people. We also know the toll that that country has, along the way, encountered. 
   Seventy-eight percent of Americans say they believe that the U.S. should withdraw some or all troops from Iraq. Sixty percent of Americans say the U.S. should set a timetable to withdraw our forces from Iraq and should ``stick to that timetable regardless of what is going on in Iraq.'' That is not because we don't care. That is because we are looking at the evidence, and we are trying to make the responsible decision for our troops, for the safety of this country and for domestic policy. 
   At this point, I would like to turn it over to Representative Shea-Porter, and we will be wrapping up here in a few moments.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, this bill has been a long time coming. As a freshman Member of this body, I am proud to rise in support of the rule and this energy legislation that will make significant strides in our effort to address global warming, save our families money on their energy bills and at the pump, and bolster our national security by mapping out a more energy-independent future for our country. 
   This energy bill includes a long overdue increase in CAFE standards and improves vehicle efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, the first  increase of this kind since 1975. This significant increase in vehicle emission standards will save American families between $700 and $1,000 per year at the pump, reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day by 2020, which is one-half of what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. And these new standards will reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking 28 million of today's average cars and trucks off the road. 
   Science tells us that CAFE increases are possible and necessary, and we must implement them now. And while implementing necessary environmental protections, this legislation will preserve tens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs in places like Avon Lake, Ohio, where my constituents produce passenger vans. 
   This bill will provide our auto manufacturers domestically with the tools and incentives they need to produce the vehicles of tomorrow here in the United States, keeping jobs at home, and allowing us to all move forward together. Keeping high-paying auto manufacturing jobs in this country will in turn help retain hundreds of thousands of related jobs in the electronics, steel, textiles, glass, plastics and rubber, and countless other sectors that produce auto parts, while also laying the groundwork for jobs in the future. 
   The American people have spoken loud and clear that we cannot turn a blind eye to the crisis of global warming and astonishing gas prices squeezing the budgets for our working families. 
   I urge support for the rule and the bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6515, DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for the time and for his leadership on this extraordinarily important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the DRILL Act, a real solution for the hardships facing our families and a real answer to the mistruths being spread to the American people. 
   The truth is that there are millions upon millions of onshore and offshore acres available for drilling, but the oil companies are only using a fraction of them. 
   The truth is that the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, also known as the NPR, is home to 20 million acres that could produce 10.6 billion barrels of oil. This area, Mr. Speaker, has been set aside for oil and gas exploration since the 1920s, but not a single oil company is producing there. 
   Mr. Speaker, the cry by those on the other side of the aisle and Big Oil, that the problem is that the oil companies don't have access to drill, is false. And it is an effort to deflect the American people from holding the two oilmen in the White House accountable, as well as their friends, for an energy policy that has given Big Oil record profits, and the American people $4 a gallon gas. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know why we need to open up ANWR when we have this huge, untapped resource right next to the existing oil infrastructure in Alaska known as the NPR. 
   The DRILL Act will accelerate the development of the NPR by requiring the Bureau of Land Management to offer annual lease sales of the land. 
   Our bill also calls for the President to facilitate the completion of oil pipelines into the NPR, and to speed construction of a natural gas pipeline to the Continental United States to move the product to the market. When this natural gas pipeline gets built, NPR will be even more important, as it holds over 60 trillion cubic feet of gas, nearly 16 times what ANWR holds. 
   And Mr. Speaker, the DRILL Act also incorporates important use it or lose it legislation which requires oil producers to drill on the leases they already have before asking us for new ones. 
   Again, the truth is that Big Oil holds leases on 68 million acres in the U.S. that they could drill on but they are not doing so. 
   And lastly, this bill also reinstitutes the ban on the export of Alaskan oil so that American oil is used right here at  home in the United States. Can you imagine, at this time of crisis, the same oil companies who are telling the American people that they want to be part of the solution, are sending the oil that they are drilling to other parts of the world, when we need that oil right here. 
   Mr. Speaker, the DRILL Act is a solution to the energy costs that our constituents are facing today.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 203 provides for consideration of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, under a structured rule with 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. 
   Madam Speaker, I am so honored to be here to talk about this rule and this bill. There is no fear quite like the fear of losing your job. It is paralyzing, because to fear for your job is to fear for your family, for their well-being and for your ability to provide for them. 
   I know this fear because I have seen it on the faces of the people who help to make our world turn, the workers who struggle every day to do the jobs we could not live without. 
   Before I was elected to Congress, I had the honor to serve as an attorney representing many of those workers. And Madam Speaker, when you work as a labor lawyer, unfortunately, often you see people with that fear in their eyes. They come to you because their jobs are being threatened, or worse, because they have been wrongfully terminated because they were attempting to organize a union or promote union activity to improve their lives and the lives of their coworkers. 
   But it doesn't have to be this way. In this country, employees who actively promote union organizing have a 1-in-5 chance of getting fired for their activities. Every 23 minutes, a United States worker is retaliated against for their support of a union. 
   In 1958, about 1,000 workers received back-pay awards because their employers violated labor organizing laws. In 2005, over 31,000 workers received back-pay awards. 
   It is a common tactic of those who oppose workers' rights to cast those who support them as relics of another era. They speak of unions as entities  that were necessary remedies for abuses of a different time, and then they point to the dwindling union membership as evidence that organizing is no longer needed. 
   But smaller union rolls are a symptom of a larger disease, not evidence of a cure. 
   The quality of life we know in this Nation was built on the back of the American labor movement. More than half of the United States workforce says they would join a union right now if they could, yet only 12 percent of them are in one. 
   Less people are joining labor unions, not because less people want to be a part of them; less people are joining labor unions because far too often irresponsible employers have perfected coercive tactics to fight their creation. 
   Imagine if tomorrow you are taken into a room with your supervisor who sits you down and tells you, if you support organizing a union and the union wins, your business will close down. And then your boss tells you, if the union doesn't win, you will be fired anyway. 
   The situation is not hypothetical. Research shows us that these threats and intimidation tactics are used to inhibit union organization. It sure may be illegal to fire an employee for voting in support of a union, but it is done anyway. And as things stand today, there are no real repercussions for doing so, because there are no fines or civil penalties for breaking the law. 
   Let me tell you about a journeyman welder from Northeast Ohio and what he and his family have endured, all because he and others where he worked tried to form a union. His name is Dave, and the company he worked for was intent on keeping the union out. And as you will learn, the company was willing to go to extraordinary and egregious lengths to do it. 
   So what happened to Dave? Since he began his efforts to help organize, he has been relegated to picking up cigarette butts at company headquarters instead of plying his skill in the field in an attempt to humiliate him. 
   He has been singled out at captive audience meetings with verbal abuse by his employer that was so bad that Dave feared it would get violent. He has had supervisors make physically threatening remarks to him while he was in inherently vulnerable positions working in the field. And in a particularly reprehensible action, Dave's wife has been targeted for harassment that escalated to such a point that she was hospitalized, all to keep the union out. 
   There is one thing that is clear, these tactics work. They are effective in suppressing the creation of unions, but they are not acceptable and they must stop. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act establishes real penalties for employee intimidation by increasing the back-pay award when a worker is fired or illegally discriminated against. It also provides for civil penalties for willful or repeated violations. It will act as a disincentive for such egregious behavior. 
   Furthermore, this legislation allows employees to unionize when a majority of workers sign cards in support of organizing, and forces the NLRB to recognize that union as a bargaining entity without giving the employer the opportunity to unilaterally veto that decision and demand an election that offers an opportunity for coercion and manipulation. 
   This bill also continues to give employees the choice to form a union through a traditional secret ballot election as current law does. 
   Now, let's be clear. It does not eliminate the opportunity for employees to have a secret ballot election. It simply eliminates the opportunity for an employer to require an election by secret ballot after employees have already voted for union representation through their chosen route of card check. 
   Another important aspect of this bill is that it requires the NLRB to step in and stop illegal behavior when it is happening. 
   And finally, and equally important, this legislation provides a path towards binding arbitration for first contracts. Right now, in 34 percent of cases a first contract is not reached, they are dragged out with the hopes of employees giving up and disbanding the union. 
   This law pushes both sides to bargain in good faith. 
   And that is really where we should be going; a world where both employers and employees approach the table with an intention to make a good faith attempt to come to an agreement. 
   The old paradigms do not need to exist as they once did. I have witnessed partnerships between giants of industry and the workers on the line that have enabled businesses to thrive. 
   Lessons can be learned from situations where employers have respected their employees' stated desire to form a union through the majority card signing method. Companies like Kaiser Permanente and Cingular. Veering away from anti-union tactics, these employers have focused on and enjoyed success working with their employees, not against them. 
   Cingular has not stood in the way of its employees forming unions, and the model they have committed to has not stopped them from becoming the Nation's top cell phone carrier. 
   It doesn't have to be an either/or process, but it does have to be a fair process. And that is what this bill will accomplish. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, we have made it clear this morning why passing this bipartisan Employee Free Choice Act is so vital for workers and their families all across this Nation. 
   Let me add that it is also important to the working families like the one I come from in Lorain, Akron, Barberton and other communities in my congressional district and all across Ohio. 
   I stand before you as a person who practiced labor law but I also stand before you as a person, a daughter of a man who worked in the boilermaker factory his whole life, the wife of a former firefighter, the sister of a teacher, the aunt of a united food and commercial worker, the sister of a steelworker. 
   This bill is about fairness for those who make the world turn, who provide for their families, who are good citizens that care about their communities. 
   The EFCA will help end years of discrimination against workers who simply wish to be able to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions. We have a moral responsibility to stand up for these workers, and I will not sit idly by while their fundamental rights are being trampled on. 
   For working families in Ohio and across this Nation, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for the education that he is giving us about why it was so important that we passed this bill today. 
   As you can see from this chart, the productivity in this country continues to rise. The workers are working harder, but unfortunately, the wages are staying the same. There are those who say that we are going to make it in this world if we can just get productivity up and up and up, but unfortunately, that chart is showing that that is not necessarily the case. 
   What we are seeing go up and up and up is that income inequality that is existing, and more and more people falling from what used to be the middle class that was frankly built by organized labor in this country, fought for by the people who brought us great advancements like the weekend, the 40-hour work week, ended child labor laws and improved safety in working conditions, who fought for Social Security and disability and pension benefits for people, fought for the salt of the earth folks back in my district to help them have a life that would be good for themselves and their families. 
   So I am very, very proud of what we did today in passing the Employee Free Choice Act, and I have to tell you, I had the pleasure before I came to Congress to represent some of these workers. I was a labor lawyer, and I have to say, there is nothing like fear, the fear of losing your job, and unfortunately, I had to see that fear quite a lot because when you are a labor lawyer, that is when people come to you, when they are being threatened or harassed because they are trying to 
   organize or engage in union activity to try and uplift themselves, their families and their coworkers and they are being threatened because of that activity that they are going to lose their job. 
   I will tell you, you shared with us one of the stories that came from your district. There is a gentleman back in northeast Ohio by the name of Dave who is a journeyman, and he is a highly skilled tradesman. When he got involved in trying to create a union in his workplace, the company went to great extents to keep it out. They put Dave, instead of using him for the trade that he plies in, highly in demand, they had him cleaning up cigarette butts at the company headquarters. They did not stop there either. In a long and sordid tale, that ended with Dave's wife actually being harassed so much by the company that she ended up hospitalized, all of this to keep out a union shop. 
   I guess the beauty of this, if there is any in this story, is it does not have to be this way, and we have heard there are examples out there where industry giants have recognized and respected union membership or the employees who want to engage in union activity and have a union to represent them and to be like Cingular who are still doing very well in the market and to these like Kaiser Permanente. 
   It does not have to be this way, and this bill actually takes us down the path to greater harmony in employment and employer and employee relationships. So I am really proud about this, and I would like to just yield over here to my friend KEITH ELLISON.

   Ms. SUTTON. That is exactly right. As I mentioned, there are industry giants who are working well with their employees. And just as in your district, in my district there have been unions that have sacrificed for the prosperity and, frankly, just to keep the business going another year, another day, another month. And when times turn good, the hope is, that ongoing relationship carries them all through. 
   I mentioned that I was a labor lawyer, and one of the toughest things, but probably the most common thing I had to do was try to find ways that we could work things out together, because we really are in it together. And this bill was just about putting us in a place where we could work constructively together. 
   So, instead of having those employers out there who would choose perhaps instead of working with their employees to a better future, and instead choose to work against them, it is about leveling that out and progress for all. 
   So I see the gentleman there has pulled up a chart that is labeled ``Myths.'' And we heard a lot today on this House floor that, frankly, just did not represent the facts, and I would just urge the gentleman to kind of correct the record there.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (U.S. TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Michaud and Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ and Mr. Hare. You have been leaders in this fight for a new U.S. trade policy for many years to benefit and to help our working men and women, our businesses, and our communities, and we appreciate your efforts. On behalf of the people of the 13th District of Ohio, I appreciate your efforts working to craft a new trade model that won't leave our businesses and our workers at a disadvantage. 
   And, frankly, last November in the election, the American people cast votes that reflect their desire to put an end to the flawed trade model that has had a devastating impact on our families and businesses and workers and farmers and communities. 
   And yet we recently heard about a new trade deal, and it has been mentioned here today, revolving around the Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreement. And that recent deal between some congressional leaders and the Bush administration seemingly provides that labor and environmental standards will be added to those two free trade agreements. However, shortly after that announcement was made, reports indicated that those standards might be put into side agreements or side letters, and those statements were made by those who represent the multinational interests who have been benefiting under our current failed trade policies. And they have boasted also about how those standards would not be enforced. And based on this administration's abominable record on enforcing free trade agreements, I think we can all agree that that is what will happen under this administration. 
   It has been mentioned here today that there was a free trade agreement with Jordan that was entered into by this country, and there were many who support fair trade, like Mr. Michaud and Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ and Mr. Hare and me. Of those who support fair trade, some of them saw fit actually to support that free trade agreement with Jordan because it had environmental and labor standards in the agreement. 
   Well, what we saw is that despite those standards, under this administration, despite records indicating documented cases of child sweatshop labor, among other things, there was no enforcement of the standards. So the fact that they are going to be on paper but not enforced really isn't what I believe the American people had in mind when they voted, and I certainly don't think it is all that we need to be doing in Congress to fix our broken trade system. 
   Now, in an effort to shut down the debate, oftentimes those who are benefiting under the current trade system characterize those of us who are seeking to fix it as protectionists. They insinuate that we are really against trade and don't understand the realities of globalization. Well, that is incorrect. This isn't about being pro-trade or antitrade. It is about the rules of trade and ensuring that they are fair and enforceable. We need a trade model that truly allows fair competition because we know that if provided that opportunity, we will excel in the global marketplace. And that is the trade model that we are fighting for. We are fighting for a trade model that will not reward companies for moving overseas or outsourcing jobs and will put an enforceable end to illegal foreign subsidies and currency manipulation. We are fighting for a policy that will provide incentives to help our businesses, workers, and communities thrive that will require reciprocity of market access and ensure products produced elsewhere are safe for consumption here. 
   Now, we agree that we must invest in new technology, innovation, and workforce development, and we have to invest in research and development. But it is not an either/or proposition. Unless we also develop a new trade model, our workers, businesses, and communities will continue to be unfairly undercut, and we see that reflected in our soaring trade deficit. 
   So why is it that the Bush administration and many Members of Congress find it acceptable that other nations engage in unfair trade practices at the expense of those who toil here, whether it is a lack of meaningful and enforceable labor and environmental standards or currency manipulation, tariff and nontariff barriers, value-added taxes, and we could go on and on about the tactics that are used and keep our businesses and workers at a disadvantage? But for some reason it seems that there are those in Washington here who seem to believe that we can continue our current trade policies and that other countries will change. But why would they? It is working for them. Just look at our trade deficit. 
   Well, those politicians who think this is a good system that we have going should visit Ohio's 13th District. Come and see the places that I have the honor to represent because a lot of people there are hurting from the failed trade policies that have been thrust upon them. Ohio has lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. Communities have been hurt and families struggle. Futures have been destroyed. There are kids out there who will not go to college. There are families out there where health care needs are not being met. And it is directly related to our failed trade policies. And unless we make meaningful changes by enacting a truly new trade model, we can't reverse this downward spiral. 
   So while it is encouraging that these two free trade agreements seemingly provide for the possibility of stronger labor and environmental standards, any enforceability, as I said, relies on the Bush administration, and it appears that it may be a paper victory to have those standards in the agreement even if they find their way into the core part of the agreement, which we are not certain that we will actually see. 
   One more thing or, I guess, it is the overarching thing: The Constitution of the United States rests responsibility for trade with the United States Congress. I think that we head down a slippery slope as we continue to cede responsibility to the President for trade. It should be understood, as was reflected in our recent elections, that Congress must reclaim its constitutional authority and responsibility and stop ceding its responsibility to the President. It is our job to ensure a vibrant and fair trade policy, and we have to focus our attention on this task before it is too late. 
   So the inclusion of labor and environmental standards on paper, okay. But, truly, the American people expect more. Our needs are much greater than that. And we must develop a new trade model that is enforceable and comprehensive, not just on paper but in reality. And we have to do it immediately to keep the faith with the American people.     
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman from Maine.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (U.S. TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. The gentlewoman's points are well taken. 
   I am glad you brought up the issue of how far-reaching the effects of our failed trade policies go. I mean, the reality is that when we lose these jobs due to our broken trade system and the unfair trade policies that others pursue and we don't stop, what happens is our communities sometimes crumble because when those employers pull out and the jobs are gone, the tax base is gone. And then the city can't deliver services, our schools can't fund our education for our children. So it has these multiple ill effects that are set in motion. 
   You also raise a really important point, and I think it's worth emphasizing. Oftentimes, Congressman Michaud, when we have these discussions about trade, they like to say this is about business versus workers. And as you rightly point out, of course, the U.S. Business and Industry Council has been saying much of the same things that we've been saying here on the floor because they know that the window is closing, that there are many who want to literally ``make it in America,'' but because of the policies that we have in place, it is becoming all but impossible for them to do that. Once that window closes, I don't know how we get it back. So, we cannot allow that to happen. 
   On that point, I think that while we are sort of focused on this new deal about the Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreements, which of course represent a very, very small, minute portion of trade with this country, we are focused on that and the fact that there will be, at least on paper, some environmental and labor standards. Of course we are all very much in support of environmental and labor standards. But when we know that they are not going to be enforced and they are then just going to result in two more trade agreements that will result in more jobs being lost in this country, it doesn't really seem like the right place for us to be focusing when we have such a short window of time. 
   Again, you point out some very important pieces of legislation that are pending here in the House, including the Currency Manipulation bill that Congressman Ryan and Congressman Hunter have sponsored and I think we are probably cosponsors on. That is an important place that we could be focusing on that could make an important difference in the very near future if we could enact. 
   The value-added tax, a similar situation. We could be focusing, as Congress is responsible for trade, on these matters that would really make a difference in the way trade plays out for the people who we represent in this country. I think that that would be a much better focus than to continue to cede responsibility to this administration. 
   It is a critical time. I know that the people back in Ohio are counting on us. And Ohio is going to be in 
   the center of the storm, if past history is any indication, in these upcoming presidential elections. And this is an issue, I can assure you, that will be front and center in the minds of those people in Ohio as it was last year when they cast their vote. 
   With that, I will yield back to my good friend from Maine.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this rule and on this very, very important issue and for the time to speak. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the rule and in favor of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   As the elected representative of diverse constituencies, we face many challenges in this House. We face challenges that affect the lives, finances, work and health of all Americans. As we face these challenges, we are called to do everything in our power to create solutions and find relief for the problems that plague our constituents. We are called to fight. We are called to work creatively. We are called to open doors and explore new avenues. We do everything in our power to relieve suffering, to bring relief, to create opportunity and to enhance lives. 
   Today, I rise in favor of continuing that mission to do everything that we possibly can to relieve the suffering of the people of Ohio's 13th District and districts across the United States. 
   During my campaign, I had the good fortune to meet a business owner by the name of Fred Martin. For the past 33 years, Fred has lived with diabetes. Diabetes has no cure. Despite diligent care, a precise diet and insulin, shots that he takes over and over throughout the day, the best that Fred can hope for is that his disease not get any worse. He has worked meticulously over the past 33 years to manage his disease so that he could be there for his children and attend to his business, but he wonders how his life could be different. 
   Fred endures seven insulin shots every day, two before breakfast, two before lunch, two before dinner and one before bed. He pricks his finger to check his insulin levels 8 to 10 times every day. He says that he's glad that he's still here. He's grateful for all that science has done for him that has allowed for him to be around to raise his children. But he adds, please, don't stop now. 
   When discussing the potential that stem cells hold, he says, ``To deny our scientists the right to make the people in our society healthier and to help them lead better lives is really a crime! ..... I expected more of my government.'' 
   If we do not change our policies soon, we will continue to drive this cutting-edge research overseas. Just this week, newspapers report that British scientists are embarking on research which could deliver the world's first stem cell treatment for blindness. The 4 million pounds that were donated to the project came from an anonymous American philanthropist. This country cannot afford to be a hostile environment for scientific research and development. 
   Today, we have a chance to unlock a world of potential. Our researchers will no longer have to fight with one hand tied behind their back. 
   I believe that we have a duty to our constituents to do everything we can to make their lives better, to relieve their suffering and to use our government and its resources effectively and efficiently to heal, help and explore. 
   Fred Martin was right. Our constituents expect more. Today, they will get it.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be here today with some of the other Members who were newly elected just a few months ago. And, boy, it was a few months ago, but we have been making strides. And we are here to report to the American people the steps that we have taken to increase the oversight and accountability of this government. 
   I am sure that, like many of my colleagues who were elected, one of the reasons I am here, I came to Congress to clean up the culture of corruption that had so flourished under the Republican leadership in previous Congresses. And to that end, on the very first day that I was here, it was my honor to proudly cast a vote to end an era of corruption in this Capitol and to begin to change the way this Congress is doing business. To make it such that this Congress begins to enact policies that benefit the American people rather than just the special interests and the privileged few. 
   We took aim at the corruption and the abuses because it was a necessary prerequisite to creating policies that benefit all Americans. And people were tired. People were tired back in Ohio. 
   I have the privilege to represent people who are the salt of the Earth. But we saw both at the State level and the Federal level scandal after scandal. Scandals of public officials being bought off by special interests, public officials abusing power, and Republican leadership and officials neglecting to provide oversight. 
   Democrats, in the very first hours of this new Congress, they severed the links between those who would buy influence on Capitol Hill and those who would, unfortunately, willingly sell it and create and facilitate this culture of corruption that the American people have had to suffer under. We acted to clean up that corruption that eroded the public trust and resulted in far too many policies, as I said, that just benefited the few at the expense of the many. 
   We have begun and we have continued to restore oversight and accountability since that first day in our government through hearings and greater transparency, through initiatives that we have enacted and we continue to enact. And this strong congressional oversight in the 110th Congress has dramatically reversed years of neglect of the constitutional role of the Congress in providing oversight of Federal activities. 
   The American people have had enough. They have suffered enough from the lack of oversight. And I am so happy to be here with my new colleagues in this role to clean it up. 
   Just to name a couple of things, and then I am going to pass it off to some of my freshmen colleagues, but if we just go through a list and you can pick up on any of these subjects because, sadly, there are so many areas where the past Congress had been delinquent, and we have already had to move to act. 
   The war in Iraq, between the House and the Senate since we took the leadership in this body, since we became the majority under the leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, there have been more than 97 oversight hearings that have looked into the conduct of the Iraq War. And certainly that was something that the American people made loud and clear, when they elected this new majority, that they desired. 
   And, sadly, in the wake of revelations of inadequate care and conditions for wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, both the House and the Senate have launched investigations and hearings into those matters. 
   We are also looking at the political ramifications of actions taken with U.S. attorneys and the linkage of improper phone calls from Republican Members of Congress and senior staff that forced resignations of those U.S. attorneys. 
   The Hurricane Katrina response, we heard a lot right after the hurricane, after we saw the tragedy, not just the natural tragedy, but the tragedy in the lack of response of this government; and we heard a lot about how we were going to take that seriously from the last Congress. And now, because they didn't do that, we have been called upon and we have answered and House committees are looking into the housing and health care crisis that persists after that bungled response to the gulf coast disaster. 
   And we are also looking at and addressing the many aspects of the climate crisis and our dependence on nonrenewable fuels from foreign sources. Investigations, hearings, initiatives that are long overdue. And, of course, there are many, many upcoming hearings. 
   And at this point what I would like to do is, I would like to yield to my friend from Minnesota, Representative Ellison, to hear what you think about some of these things that we have been doing in this new Congress.

I think it is with heartfelt appreciation, not only on behalf of myself, but on behalf of the people that I represent, that I am grateful that you sit on the Judiciary Committee, where you are going to provide the oversight and the accountability on the issues that you brought forward here tonight. 
   You are right, that there is nothing more important than restoring the trust of the people we represent in this government. And it is not the end in and of itself, but it is essential, to both the substance and the spirit of what we do. The corruption has hurt the American people in so many ways. So this oversight and accountability is sorely needed, long overdue. 
   With that, I would like to recognize another distinguished gentleman from  the State of Minnesota who we are honored to have join us this evening, a new Member of Congress, somebody who came here to change the direction of this country, to take us in a new and positive, honest direction, Mr. Tim Walz. What do you think about all this?

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota, and I thank you for your leadership, and for that example of how public policy can work for the people, that it doesn't have to be the way that it has been. You point out an important point.     
   In the first 100 hours, when we took steps to clean up some of the unfortunate practices that have happened in the past and to change some of the resulting policies or the failure to enact some good policies, when we actually brought those measures to the floor under this new Democratic leadership, we did enjoy broad bipartisan support for many of those measures. 
   This is not just a Democratic agenda, this is about the people's agenda. That is what this House is about. I am glad, with the leadership we have, we are now getting the people's agenda on this floor so that people from both parties have the chance to deliver the kind of public policy that will help the people they are sent here to serve. 
   At this point, I would like to yield to a new Member in this Congress, a tremendous leader, a woman who has shown unwavering dedication and commitment to the people she was sent here to serve, Representative Shea-Porter from the State of New Hampshire.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from New Hampshire, and I appreciate your service, as do the people I represent, and your leadership. 
   You bring up so many important points. The bad news is that so much has gone wrong in the past due to the failure of proper oversight and accountability. The good news is that, as  you point out, we heard the call of the American people for more. We know what the expectations are, and we know what our responsibility is. And every day I am honored to come here with you to serve, and knowing that that is why we are here in the people's House, to help make those course corrections that will take this country in a new direction. 
   It is so important to be here tonight to talk about that oversight and accountability because it is essential if we are to make those course corrections, whether it be one of the points you make about the growing income and inequality, which is at record levels. We are losing the middle class. There are many, many things that we can do and we have already done, and we have talked about some of them today in the opening hours of Congress when we increased the minimum wage, when we made college education more accessible and more affordable, when we expanded research and development into alternative fuels which will provide us not only with a way to deal with an environmental imperative, but also as a security issue we have to address that, and our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Also, it provides us with opportunity for jobs today and tomorrow for the people out there because one of the other ways that Congress can show its oversight and accountability commitment, and I expect that we will because we heard a lot about this on the campaign trail from the American people, is on the issue of trade because we are losing jobs and our trade policies are not working for the American people and American businesses in the way that they should. 
   So I am confident that one of the things that we are going to do is exercise our constitutional responsibility to deal with trade and make sure whatever trade model we have--and we are for trade, and I hope to get to the day in the early days of this coming Congress, or later on in this Congress, that we can vote for a trade policy that will truly lift up American workers as well as workers abroad, and that we will be able to vote for a trade policy that has environmental standards that benefit America and this world. 
   There are so many options that we can do. There are so many things that we can do. We can have a trade policy with enforceability to stop the unfair manipulation and unfair trade practices. These are all matters of accountability and oversight, and this Congress I know is committed to producing that. 
   Now I want to again yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, because another point that the distinguished gentlewoman from New Hampshire brought up was the issue of our veterans and what we are doing and not doing to serve our veterans who have served us so nobly. 
   So I yield to Representative Walz who has some charts that he is going to share with the American people.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the distinguished gentleman and both of you, the gentleman from Minnesota as well, who point out so eloquently the responsibility that we have when we put forth a budget. 
   I am honored as a freshman Member of this Congress to have the honor to serve on the Budget Committee, and while I am grateful to be there because we have the chance to realign the budget that came to us from the administration, I must say that when it came over, when it failed to provide the resources that we need for veterans health care and asked our veterans to pay more for their health care, it was a great disappointment. 
   But the reality is, because we are in a fiscal mess, because of years of irresponsibility, failure to provide oversight and accountability, even though we have limited resources because of that, I know that this class and this Congress is committed to realigning the money that we do have to ensure that we do, Mr. Speaker, that we do provide our troops what they need when we send them into any mission on our behalf and that they have what they need after they return. 
   Our commitment to ensuring oversight and accountability is going to be an ongoing mission because it is an ongoing responsibility. It is, in fact, the very essence of what our congressional duty is, to be that check, to ensure that which we enact and that which is done from the administration comports with the needs of the American people, and we will do so in an honest and open way. 
   We have heard about some of the steps that we have already taken, the first step, to restore trust, openness and accountability in Washington. This week, we are going to take additional actions, and in fact, we have already taken some here on this floor today. 
   In this week, we have scheduled consideration or acted already on whistleblower reform. We are going to deal with that issue. We are strengthening the protection for Federal whistleblowers to prevent retaliation against those who report wrongdoing, waste, fraud and abuse. This is so essential to making sure that the safeguards that we need will result in the kind of a government and the policies and the contracting and the work of the people will be of such a caliber that we can be proud, and more importantly, the American people can be proud. 
   We are also providing for more timely disclosure of government documents, another good measure not only of good government but of accountability, that will pay huge dividends and allow us to ensure that we are acting wisely and responsibly. 
   We are also nullifying a 2001 presidential executive order and restoring public access to presidential records. The public has a right to know the public's business. This is another measure to ensure that. 
   As we talk about the need to fund veterans health care, how can we fail to mention at the same time we fail to meet that need, we have seen gross excesses of lack of oversight and accountability and money, literally being lost in Iraq due to a failure of proper oversight of those we contract with. Limits on how long Federal no-bid contracts can last will be enacted this week by this new Congress. We will minimize the use of no-bid contracts and direct agencies to justify any such contracts if they are awarded. 
   These are all important measures that we will take this week in order to  continue to fulfill our commitment to the American people to take this country into a new direction, one that will work for them and one that has their interests at heart. 
   As we come to the conclusion of our hour, I would just like to give my colleagues another opportunity to report what they would like to report in these closing moments to the American people. I yield to my good friend from Minnesota (Mr. Walz).

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this issue, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his eloquence in speaking to it as well. 
   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of House Resolution 1200, a resolution I introduced to honor some of the unsung heroes of our Nation. They are our military support groups. 
   All across our great Nation and throughout the world, our troops and their families are making incredible sacrifices for our country. Since 2001, more than 1.7 million members of the Armed Forces have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. And many of these brave men and women are being sent back for numerous tours of duty, and each time they represent our country with honor and a proud sense of duty. And we must never forget the incredible service they provide for our great Nation. 
   We, as Members of Congress, must do everything in our power to ease the burden their service places on them and their families. 
   One incredible source of support and assistance for our troops and their families are military support groups. All across our country, servicemembers and their families and friends have formed these crucial support networks. 
   Military support groups offer a variety of important services to members of our Armed Forces and their families. From providing financial assistance, employment assistance and tax return preparation, to offering counseling and prayer groups, sending care packages and writing letters, support groups serve a vital purpose within the military family and within our communities. 
   My bill, House Resolution 1200, honors the dedication and outstanding work of military support groups across this country for their steadfast support of the members of our Armed Forces and their families. 
   I'm very proud, Mr. Speaker, that one of these support groups, Family and Friends Connected, is based in Akron, Ohio, in my congressional district. This group was started by one of my constituents, Saundra Hunt. With a daughter in the Air Force and a son in the Marine Corps, Saundra knows more than a thing or two about the need to support our military families. And so, on November 9, 2001, Saundra established Family and Friends Connected to bring military families together. And on the second Friday of every month, military families and friends from all over northeastern Ohio come together to support one another. They come from Akron and Barberton and Canton and Cleveland; they come from Cuyahoga Falls, and Copley and Dover and Hartville, Hudson, Stow and Tallmadge and Wadsworth. They come together to find common support. 
   I want to take a moment and recognize Saundra, who took her own family's experience and used it to make a positive impact on the lives of others in the same situation. Saundra dedicates a listening ear to military families, and is available to them at every hour, day or night. Because of her endless commitment and compassion, there is an obvious love for her within the group. 
   I've had the honor and privilege of attending one of their meetings, and I can attest firsthand to the dedication and the uplifting camaraderie of those who participate in Family and Friends Connected. 
   Saundra and the Family and Friends Connected are just one example of the many support groups across the country that have provided endless amounts of time, energy and compassion to our military families. These are people who truly understand what military families go through, and they provide very real comfort and support for one another. 
   The kindness and understanding these groups provide to our servicemembers and to each other is nothing short of inspirational. It is such an important service for our Nation's military families and yet, Mr. Speaker, they ask for nothing in return. They do it because of a love of country, a respect for service, and an understanding of the sacrifices that our military families so selflessly make. Their unwavering emotional and material support helps to fortify our military, allowing them to carry out the missions our Nation asks of them. 
   We, in Congress, must always honor our brave servicemen and women, in word and in deed. Likewise, we should  honor those who dedicate themselves to their support. That's why I introduced this important resolution to honor these amazing groups. They did not ask for any recognition for their service, but we can all agree that they deserve to be honored for all they do for our military families and for our country. 
   I ask for your support of this critical resolution honoring our military support groups.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN SEIBERLING -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman. I thank you for putting together this hour that we have to honor Congressman John Seiberling. I do rise with a deep sense of humility and appreciation to speak about this great man. 
   Congressman Seiberling was an extraordinary public servant and humanitarian who gave countless years of humble service to the people of northeast Ohio and our country. His unflinching commitment to the rule of law and the pursuit of social justice have inspired so many. Through selfless service, John Seiberling and his extraordinary wife, Betty, have given those of us in the Akron community, Ohio and this Nation, far more than we can adequately pay tribute to here tonight. 
   But for all that you have given us so generously in service, we thank you. 
   Though I am almost certain he would argue this point, John Seiberling was a great man, and the fact that he would, with humility, object to such praise, would only prove the point. Congressman Seiberling, together with Congressman Ralph Regula, worked to create the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, a gift for the ages, bettering the lives of people throughout our area, our country and our world. From near and far, people visit the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, making it among the most visited national parks in this country. 
   Congressman Seiberling was a special soul, one who traveled a path of common good. He touched so many lives throughout this Nation and beyond, and I, like others, like Tim and others here today, were so fortunate to have him touch ours. 
   I shall never forget the occasion that I became aware of John Seiberling. I was blessed with an opportunity to visit Washington, D.C., as a high school student. 
   As fate would have it, on the day that I came to this, the United States House of Representatives, I sat in the gallery, and the distinguished gentleman from Ohio, Congressman John Seiberling, rose to the floor to speak to an issue of the day. 
   Though I will always recall this amazing experience, I could not tell you the subject matter of his remarks. It was not the subject that struck me that day, it was his passion, his unabashed resolve. It was the heart with which he spoke on behalf of those he so clearly served. 
   After leaving Congress, Representative Seiberling returned home to Akron and continued his service to our community as a teacher and a scholar. 
   Fate again brought me to his presence. As a law student at the University of Akron School of Law, I had the privilege to be his student. My fellow law students and I were blessed to witness his humble strength and his enduring belief in public service as a pursuit of a high calling. 
   As he taught us about the legislative process, which was the subject of the course, we learned about the work and perseverance that went into the creation of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and also into passage of the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, which was an achievement of historic proportion. 
   But amazing though his achievements were, Congressman Seiberling never bragged of his accomplishments. He was far too modest for such things. 
   Instead, he focused on teaching us about how to make the legislative process work, even against long odds. For the knowledge that he shared, I will always be grateful. 
   Though his modesty precluded him from bragging, make no mistake. The Alaska Lands Act of 1980 was historic, and as its author, Congressman Seiberling deserves our admiration and appreciation. 
   Describing the importance of this immense contribution to the country, in 2001, when President Clinton presented Congressman Seiberling with the Presidential Citizens Medal, Clinton said, ``With that legislation, John Seiberling single-handedly saved more of our wilderness than any previous American, a legacy that will last for generations.'' 
   Congressman Seiberling, with his vision, perseverance and courage, with his heart and mind combined, he made our community and our country and our world a better and more just place, leaving us with a legacy and inspiration that shall long endure. 
   Thank you, Congressman Seiberling, for the life that you lived and the example you set. 
   Betty, thank you and your family for all that you have given so generously. I thank you for the time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (45TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN HERSCHEL GLENN, JR. BECOMING FIRST U.S. ASTRONAUT TO ORBIT EARTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, today I join my colleagues from Ohio and across the country in the celebration of the 45th anniversary of John Herschel Glenn Jr.'s historic journey around our planet. 
   Senator Glenn, a proud Ohio native, carried the hopes and dreams of an entire country with him on his February 20, 1962 trip. He carried those dreams in the tiny Friendship 7 space capsule, no more than 9 feet high and 6 feet wide atop the Atlas rocket. He carried those dreams into orbit at the astonishing speed of 5 miles per second. 
   Senator Glenn piloted the Friendship 7 capsule around the globe three times, becoming the first American to orbit the earth, an accomplishment that raised the spirits of all Americans. 
   When speaking about the historic journey, Glenn recounted later saying, ``I don't know what you can say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets, three in orbit and one on the surface after I was back on board the ship.'' 
   While Glenn was witnessing sunset from the window of the space capsule, the country was witnessing the sun rising on America's fledgling space program, and our Nation's hunger for space exploration. 
   I had the tremendous honor of meeting Senator Glenn when I was in high school. I distinctly remember being in awe of his lifetime of accomplishments. He has led this country in almost every way possible, as a pioneering adventurer, as a scientist, as a military hero, as an elected leader, and as a champion of education. 
   Senator Glenn and all of his accomplishments are an embodiment of our country's can-do attitude. It is in recognition and eternal gratitude that I join my colleagues in rising today to honor this great man and the 45th anniversary of his momentous voyage into the great beyond. 
   Thank you, Senator Glenn, and may your continued journey through life be a lesson in adventure and bravery to us all.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, the American people have demanded a new direction in Iraq, and last week this Congress voted to put an end to the administration's failed stay-the-course policy. 
   The President should support our troops and sign this responsible bill instead of issuing veto threats that continue to ignore the reality of our troops' being caught in the middle of a civil war. It is ironic that we are expecting the President to veto this bill to bring our troops home 4 years to the day after he declared the job done in Iraq. It is time for accountability from the administration and from the Iraqi Government. 
   Our bill provides what the American people are demanding and what our troops need: a responsible policy that funds our troops, demands accountability from the administration and the Iraqi Government, and supports our veterans. 
   The President should listen to Congress. Sign this bill, take the funding, and accept accountability.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I really appreciate having this opportunity to talk with you, and I commend your work on putting this very strong legislation together that includes important increases for science and technology programs, as well as law enforcement, among many other things. 
   But I want to discuss with you just for a moment my concerns for funding and oversight in this bill for the United States Trade Representative. Now, many of my colleagues have been pretty vocal, since the beginning of this Congress, in expressing our concerns with our current trade policy and its harmful effects on our families and communities. A large part of this is what I see as a lack of responsibility by the USTR in promoting exports to other nations and protecting American workers and businesses against unfair trade practices against other nations. 
   I was going to offer a number of amendments here today dealing with increasing USTR funding, specifically for oversight and enforcement of our trade laws, but I appreciate the increase in funding in the bill for the ITC, but I believe so much more needs to be done. Instead of fixing the many problems we have with our current policies, whether it's our current record trade deficit or the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, the USTR has, instead, focused efforts on enacting more flawed trade agreements. 
   It seems as if, instead of working to make our trade agreements better, the administration and the USTR have focused on joining with private interests and using USTR funding to lobby Congress. I believe we must rein this in, what I see as an improper and excessive lobbying by USTR of Congress. 
   While I was hoping to offer an amendment on that here today as well, I hope that this Congress will take a closer look at their activities in the future. I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to stand up and tell the USTR that they must start working for American businesses and workers, rather than continue current policies that cost jobs here at home and have decimated our manufacturing base. 
   While I would have hoped that we could have done more on this bill to move USTR in that direction to be more responsive to the responsibility to the American people and to the workers in my district, rather than foreign governments and large corporations, I am happy to be here and am supportive of the bill. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you and look forward to working with you in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1483, CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 765 provides for consideration of H.R. 1483, the Celebrating America's Heritage Act. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources and makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   The rule also contains a self-executing provision to the base text consisting of a technical correction that  inserts a map reference for a map that was not completed yet by the National Park Service prior to filing the reported bill. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I begin to address the rule and the underlying bill, I want to also extend my feelings of empathy and concern for those out in California dealing with the fires that are plaguing that area of our country. We are all watching and we are all, in spirit, hoping that the fire ravaging will end. We appreciate the hard work and the fearless dedication of our fire service and our firefighters, and we hope that that situation is under control in the very, very near future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. At the outset, I would like to commend my Republican colleague and neighbor, Congressman Regula, for his leadership in sponsoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   This bill will provide additional support to nine national heritage areas and allow for the designation of six new heritage areas, making them eligible for Federal support. 
   I am proud that the Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway is among these nine national heritage areas. And I can tell you from firsthand experience that I've had with the Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway, that these heritage areas are an invaluable asset, both to the local communities and to our Nation, from the preservation of local culture and history, to increasing tourism, and as centerpieces for economic growth. 
   The designation of heritage areas provides for a partnership approach to heritage development, allowing the sites to be locally managed with a local organization coordinating in partnership with local residents. 
   These areas provide unique opportunities to understand the larger context of these regions' traditions, landscapes and people, and the heritage of this great country. 
   The Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway is not a traditional park. It's a lived-in region where the national, cultural, historic and recreational resources combine to form a nationally significant landscape that celebrates the significance of the Ohio and Erie Canal and its contribution to the region, the State of Ohio, and the United States. 
   The Ohio and Erie Canal helped connect the Ohio frontier with New York and New Orleans in the early 19th century, playing a key role in linking a previously isolated Ohio with economic centers east and south. And the canal was crucial to the development of Ohio's economy, attracting businesses to the area and providing a viable transportation route for emerging industries. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that with increased Federal support, the Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway and other heritage areas included in this legislation will continue to play central roles in their communities and equally important roles in our national heritage. 
   Similarly, Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway, the Celebrating America's Heritage Act will provide support to the National Coal Heritage Act in West Virginia, the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area, the Augusta Canal and National Heritage Area in Georgia, the Steel Industry American Heritage Area in Pennsylvania, the Essex National Heritage Area in Massachusetts, the South Carolina National Heritage Corridor, America's Agricultural Partnership in Iowa, and the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area in New York. 
   This legislation will also recognize and bring the benefits of heritage areas to six new communities throughout the Nation: Journey Through Hallowed Ground Heritage Area in Virginia, Niagara Falls National Heritage Area in New York, Muscle Shoals National Heritage Area in Alabama, Freedom's Way National Heritage Area in Illinois, and Santa Cruz Valley National Heritage Area in Arizona. 
   And it's important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation specifically includes language that protects private property rights. And the bill makes clear that a national heritage area designation does not alter existing regulations or land use plans. 
   This is a good bill that will help communities and our country celebrate our heritage and use our history for future prosperity and collective pride. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. And, again, I would like to thank Congressman RALPH REGULA from my home State of Ohio for introducing this bill and for being a champion of Ohio's heritage. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I only wish the same commitment and tenacity on behalf of veterans that is being expressed here today continues into the future, and I wish that it had been a little bit more at the surface in the past. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats, when they came into the majority in this House, passed the biggest increase for veterans health care in history. They passed in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill $6.7 billion above the fiscal year 2007 budget, which, by the way, was the largest single increase in the 77-year history of the VA, $3.8 billion above the President's request. So we are indeed on the same page in terms of protecting our Nation's veterans, and we are working diligently, not just with our words, but with our votes and with our actions to make sure that we live up to the promise that we make to our veterans. 
   Returning to the legislation and the rule at hand, Mr. Speaker, the Celebrating America's Heritage Act would provide support for some of our Nation's cultural treasures and will expand support to additional heritage areas. I cannot overstate the importance of many of these areas, not only to the local communities and the regions in which they exist, but to preserving the history of the United States, that history that those veterans fought for, by the way, and these heritage areas stand out for national parks and they are overseen by a coalition of local leaders, community members and local organizations all with an interest in the preservation in their areas' traditions and culture and in the continued vitality of their communities. These heritage areas play a key role in spurring economic development, which serve as a bridge to the future for communities as well as a constant reminder of our past and the cumulative history that has led to where we are today.  
   I know what the Ohio and Erie National Heritage Canalway means to northeast Ohio, and I know what increased Federal support will do to help it continue serving our community and our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (FRESHMEN 100 HOURS -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, there are times when the people of this great Nation need and demand things of their government that politics make it impossible to accomplish. This has been the case far too often throughout the last 12 years. Through the last election, the people of this Nation have demanded that this government reexamine and change our priorities and our direction. 
   The people have asked us to respond to their hopes and their dreams and their needs. They have asked us to realize that there are good citizens of this Nation, honest people who work hard and play by the rules and who nonetheless struggle and live in poverty and toil in obscurity through no fault of their own. 
   The people have called us to recognize the equality of opportunity, the basis upon which this Nation was founded, the means of equal access to education, equal chances to go to college. The people have demanded that we never squash the hope of science with the politics of partisan personal gain, that we never play games with the opportunity to save lives. They know that the minute that this great Nation stops being a beacon of hope and a champion of forward progress for the world, that we become something less than what we are. 
   The people have demanded that we never allow the concerns of special interests to collide with the public good, that there will come a day when the quality of our time will be judged not only on our ability to pioneer lifesaving drugs but our ability to make them available to all of our citizens. 
   The people have demanded that when you gather a group of our Nation's leading experts and ask them to take a hard look at what we need to do to keep our people safe and make our Nation stronger, that they take on that charge and honor their commitment, that you do everything necessary to implement their recommendations handed down to you; and the people have demanded that the conduct of our public officials be beyond reproach, that the great balancing act of our democracy rests upon a fulcrum of public trust that is fragile as it is vital. 
   But for the past 12 years, politics has demanded something different. Between the 104th and 109th Congress, 6,900 rollcall votes were taken, and politics prevailed almost every time. 
   In the very first few hours of the 110th Congress, the people have had their day. The people compelled us to raise the minimum wage, not politics. The people asked us to work to cut student loan rates in half, not politics. The people led us to expand stem cell research, not politics. Concern for those people made it imperative that we implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and that we take away the tax breaks for oil companies that have made their profits on the backs of recent American suffering, that we start a process for real meaningful negotiation for prescription drugs, not politics. 
   The people move us to make immediate changes in the ethical rules that govern this Chamber. Their commitment to a new day in America, and a new day in Congress made it vital that we restore the public trust. We saw the faces and heard the needs of the people we were elected to serve; and in this first 100 hours, we have acted. We have brought in new leadership that recognizes that this was a Nation disconnected with its government, and they have taken immediate and bold steps to reconnect it. 
   I would be remiss not to commend the leadership's admirable example for the past 2 weeks. 
   The people were at the heart of what we have done here so far, and the people will be at the heart of the legislative agenda we champion in the days to come.     
   Mr. Speaker, these past 2 weeks have been times of great change, historic times that herald an era of American  politics unique in its tone and compelling in its vision. You can be sure that this was only the start, and that the people will regain their rightful role in this democracy in the days and years to come.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago we passed legislation to end the culture of corruption in Congress. Today we consider legislation to reverse some of the harmful consequences of that corruption. H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act, will repeal $14 billion in tax reduction subsidies and other outrageous benefits given to the big oil companies. 
   Many of these measures were included in legislation that was written in backroom and late-night meetings. With the passage of our ethics reform in this bill, we are fulfilling our responsibility to the American people to clean up Congress and reverse the past lapses that led us to where we are today.  
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation not only repeals the excesses given to oil companies, our bill uses the money to create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve. This will invest in clean renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, develop greater efficiency and improve energy conservation. Investing in alternative and renewable energies and efficiency is not only about protecting the environment and homeland security, it is about promoting new industry and creating jobs. 
   This type of new investment will help create jobs and support industries in northeast Ohio, where we are already working on new energy technology through organizations like the Ohio Fuel Cell Coalition, which is working to strengthen Ohio's fuel cell industry. 
   I am proud to say that this coalition includes the University of Akron and the Lorain County Community College in my congressional district. This investment in new energy technology, combined with new incentives and initiatives to make higher education more accessible recently passed by this Congress, will help ensure that our students have the education and the skills necessary for the jobs of the future. 
   That is what we are doing here today, eliminating the abuses of the past and investing in our Nation's future. Let's pass the CLEAN Energy Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule on a clear and concise resolution that expresses the will of the American people. Our troops are brave and capable. They have fought overwhelming odds and in the face of incomprehensible difficulty. They have engaged in many acts of heroism. And this resolution makes it unequivocally clear that those of us who feel it incumbent to speak out in opposition to the President's escalation nonetheless continue to support our troops. 
   All of us and all Americans support our troops. They must have and we must provide that which they need for any mission which they are sent. But Congress also has a responsibility to provide oversight, to ensure that our brave and honorable troops are provided a mission based on realistic assessments and an achievable goal before we ask them to risk life and limb to implement it. 
   The President has asked Congress and the American people to support his plan to escalate our involvement in the war in Iraq by sending an additional 20,000 troops, and that doesn't count the additional 20,000 support personnel that will be part of the escalation. 
   This war is almost 4 years long now. Congress has not spoken as loudly and as clearly as its responsibility requires. As the Representative of the 13th District of Ohio, I cannot sit silent. I am opposed to the President's plan for escalation, and, as such, I fully support this rule and resolution. 
   The President's own military commanders and experts have advised against this course of action. My constituents and the American people have made their position known. People across this Nation voted for a change in direction in Iraq. The plan to escalate is directly contradictory to that call for change. It takes us further down the wrong path, getting us deeper and deeper with a policy that asks our military to accomplish the nonmilitary mission of creating a viable, unified government in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (JOSH MILLER HEARTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, there are no words to describe the pain we feel when a young life is lost. 
   To know Josh Miller was to know a kindhearted and generous young man with limitless potential. Josh was a Baberton High School sophomore with a 4.0 grade point average, a linebacker who dreamed of playing football for Ohio State one day. 
   But one day, without warning, these dreams were cut short. Josh had never shown any signs of heart trouble, but during the final game of the 2000 football season, he collapsed after leaving the field. By the time his heart was shocked with an automated external defibrillator, it was too late to save him. 
   Josh suffered a sudden cardiac arrest, which, according to the American Heart Association, claims the lives of about 330,000 Americans every year. The vast majority of these individuals, like Josh, will not have displayed any signs of heart trouble beforehand; yet there is an easy-to-use, relatively inexpensive piece of medical equipment that can more than double the odds of survival for someone experiencing such a sudden cardiac arrest. 
   An automated external defibrillator, or AED, is the single-most effective treatment for starting the heart after sudden cardiac arrest. And because chances of survival decrease up to 10 percent for every minute that passes, every second is critical. 
   It is incredibly important that we take steps to educate the public about the life-and-death difference that using these devices would make. I would like to thank and to commend my colleague, Mr. Kuhl, for his efforts in promoting increased access to AEDs through the resolution passed this afternoon. Later this week, I will be introducing a piece of legislation that takes another step to increase the ability of AEDs in our communities. 
   The Josh Miller HEARTS Act will establish a grant program that will help schools across the country purchase these lifesaving devices. Schools are central gathering places in our communities, and placing AEDs in our schools will not only save the lives of students enrolled there, potentially, but they will be available for teachers and staff, parents and volunteers, and the many other members of the community who pass through the halls every single day. 
   This legislation will be modeled on a similar program recently completed in the State of Ohio. Dr. Terry Gordon, a cardiologist at Akron General Hospital, has dedicated his life to this campaign. And his tireless efforts in Ohio led to the adoption of a statewide initiative to put an AED into every school across the State. Already, this program has saved the lives of 12 children and adults as a direct result. 
   I hope we in Congress can build on Dr. Gordon's good work and carry out this program at the national level. Losing a young life full of promise, like Josh's, can bring about a sense of helplessness. But today, we have an opportunity to act. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to bring AEDs into every single school across this country.

The text of this substitute amendment is almost identical to the version of the bill that was considered under suspension of the rules on July 30. That bill received 276 votes from both sides of the aisle. 
   Madam Speaker, since this bill was last on the House floor in July, the American people and our economy continue to struggle with high food and energy prices and a weak job market. From the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial meltdown, to the unethical behavior of the Minerals Management Service, the necessary and proper oversight has clearly not been taking place. In some cases laws may have been broken, and as a result homes have been taken through foreclosure. Savings have been lost. Dreams of the American people in many cases have been shattered. 
   Madam Speaker, we are fighting to stop the pain that the American people are feeling, to restore their trust in government, and revitalize our communities. 
   We must take action and we must take action now. For many years now, too many Americans have felt that their government is working not with them but against them. But this Democratic Congress is working to take our Nation in a new direction. On Tuesday we passed a comprehensive energy bill that will lower gas prices for American families, invest in renewable and alternative energy, and responsibly expand exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf.     
   But Madam Speaker, speculators continue to enjoy free rein at the expense of our pocketbooks. And that is unacceptable. 
   We have all seen the recent headlines and reports identifying that oil speculators are out of control. One of the newspapers serving my congressional district, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, printed an article last Thursday on this very issue. The headline read, ``More scrutiny of oil speculators. Evidence shows they operated in `dark markets' to hide prices.'' 
   The article goes on to state that ``unregulated markets account for about two-thirds of oil trading, and that they can be used to manipulate oil prices.'' 
   Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, the American people simply want a government that works for them instead of against them. Today, we will pass the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act so that our commodity markets will, once again, work the way they were intended to work. 
   Our bill provides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, with new resources to improve enforcement, prevent manipulation and prosecute fraud. It provides the CFTC with the authority and direction to address excessive speculation which has undermined the basic principles of supply and demand. It has artificially inflated the price of oil and, in the process, has hurt families in Ohio and all across this great Nation. This bill will work for the people, instead of working for those who look to exploit loopholes and seek to manipulate the market. 
   Now we all know that Wall Street has found exotic ways to create their own markets, and with this bill, we will fix the London Loophole. And why is that important? 
   The London Loophole currently allows traders to circumvent U.S. laws and trading rules by working through foreign boards of trade. This bill requires foreign boards of trade that offer electronic access to U.S. traders to adopt similar speculative limits and regulations. The foreign boards of trade will also now be required to share large trader reporting data with the CFTC. 
   Additionally, H.R. 6604 requires that the CFTC set standards for all energy and agricultural futures markets. This is critically important, as it will limit traders' ability to distort the market. 
   Our bill will also require the CFTC to have a complete picture now of the swaps markets. Index traders and swap dealers will be subject to strict reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 
   And lastly, under this bill, position reporting will become mandatory for over-the-counter trading in agricultural and energy contracts. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, some of what I've said sounds very technical, and it may be a little bit difficult to understand because of that technicality. But to put it very simply, our actions here today will add the necessary oversight and transparency to shed light on the ``dark markets.'' 
   With the recent revelations on Wall Street and the run-up on oil prices under the Bush administration's failed energy policy, these changes are long overdue. 
   But there are some, Madam Speaker, who may not want us to make the changes in our market system so that we can bring relief to the American people. There are some who may try to say that we're adding too much regulation. 
   But the recent collapse of certain financial giants has only further illustrated the great need to revisit these issues and ensure that the voices of the people are being heard, and that they are being protected. 
   There are some who may try to say that we're restricting the ability of hedgers, those who trade in futures, to offset their price risk. But they are misinformed. This bill provides exemptions for bona fide hedgers. They are the ones that the commodity markets were designed to work with. 
   But we know that unscrupulous speculators can interfere with the ability of producers and processors who use these markets for legitimate purposes. On Tuesday, as speculators dumped oil for cash, oil closed at just over $91 a barrel, a nearly 38 percent drop since the record high of $147 in July. But just yesterday, oil prices shot up $6 a barrel as, ``fears of a spreading crisis in the U.S. financial sector sent skittish investors scrambling out of stocks,'' according to the AP. 
   Madam Speaker, our commodities should not be treated as a speculator's safety net. We cannot allow speculators to continue to drive prices of our  commodities beyond the normal ebb and flow of supply and demand. 
   Families in my district and all across our great country want commonsense policies that will work for them, instead of rewarding a select few. This is the new direction that the American people have called for, one that puts the voices of the people ahead of the special interests. 
   I hope that all of our colleagues will join us in taking this step today to pass this bill that, as I mentioned, has previously passed with a bipartisan majority in July, but not the two-thirds majority that was necessary under suspension. But we can get it done. 
   Madam Speaker, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act will increase oversight and transparency, and will prevent oil prices from being artificially inflated. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1449 and this incredibly important underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Before I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Vermont, I would like to yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee for coming forward and talking about this issue here today and for making the point that this bill is a bill that is virtually identical to a bill that was passed in July, as I said, on a very big bipartisan vote; 61 of our friends, the Republicans, voted for it, including Mr. Conaway. That bill was the result of multiple hearings in the Agriculture Committee, and no Republicans during that period of time offered up any amendments in the Ag Committee markup. 
   Chairman Peterson graciously made it very clear here today that this bill continues through the process and that he is absolutely willing to work with Mr. Conaway as we move forward on this very, very important legislation. 
   At this time, Madam Speaker, it's my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Rules Committee.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. The Republican Party and my good friend from Texas, they had 12 years to put forward a comprehensive energy policy for the future, and they failed to do so. And for 12 years, they had the opportunity to provide accountability and oversight in our commodities market, and they failed to do so. 
   Earlier this week, we took steps to pass a comprehensive energy bill that's going to lower prices for consumers, protect taxpayers, expand responsible offshore domestic drilling, expand renewable sources of energy, increase our security by freeing America from the grip of foreign oil, and require Big Oil to pay what it owes to America's taxpayers. And we're going to create good-paying jobs as we move forward on this forward-thinking energy policy. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, we pass an equally important measure. All of those out there who have been held hostage by the greed of some of our speculators who treat our commodities  as a safety net, well, the party is over. This bill will strengthen the CFTC's enforcement resources. In recent days, trading volume has increased 8,000 percent since the CFTC was created, but the agency is operating at its lowest staffing level since 1974. This bill calls for a minimum of 100 full-time CFTC employees to enforce manipulation and fraud regulation. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is about protecting and strengthening the economy for the people in Ohio and across America, not a select few on Wall Street and abroad. It's time that we get it done. It's about ensuring that the loopholes are closed to prevent another historic run-up in the price of oil. It's about providing the tools and having the political will to prevent potential price distortions caused by excessive speculative trading. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill was passed by the Agriculture Committee by a voice vote in a bipartisan manner in July. So no matter what we hear from those who may oppose what we are trying to do, we need to pass this bill. It's the right thing to do for our country, it's the right thing to do for our constituents. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 556, the National Security FIRST Act, and I believe this bill is a good example of how we can ensure our Nation's security and still encourage foreign investment to help create and maintain jobs. 
   While I didn't have the honor to serve in the last Congress, I can tell you that the Dubai Ports World deal was not well received in northeast Ohio. Myself, and many of our constituents, wondered how such a concerning deal could have been approved. The answer was that there was little accountability, oversight and transparency with the way the Committee on Foreign Investment and the United States, or CFIUS, worked. The DPW deal was so concerning to this Congress last year, as has been mentioned, that legislation very similar to that which we are passing today passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 424-0. H.R. 556 ensures that these matters are addressed and gives both the administration and Congress greater responsibilities for dealing with foreign investment in our Nation. 
   We can have oversight, accountability and transparency and still support American businesses and workers. That is the lesson of this bill. This bill enjoys broad support, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business organizations. This bill represents another bipartisan success. I am pleased to support it, and I encourage its passage to ensure our national security.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. I am fortunate and thankful to have had the opportunity to work with Representative Boswell to offer this important amendment, which would require that areas that have lost a major source of employment be given priority when applying for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards. 
   Representative Boswell, as he described, and I both know firsthand the devastating effects that massive job losses can have on a community when a major employer closes shop. The loss  of good-paying jobs can really hurt when a major employer leaves a community. It's estimated that for every manufacturing job in the United States, it creates as many as four related jobs. So when those jobs pack up and leave, it's a problem. 
   Focusing funds and awards in areas that have suffered the most, to the areas that have endured major job losses, such as those in my district or Representative Boswell's district, will ensure that the money is helping the people in the communities that need it most. These programs will help keep our communities self-sustaining as we work to revitalize our economies. 
   Ohio has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, and unfortunately, Representative Boswell's district in the home State of Iowa have also lost thousands of jobs. With this amendment, applicants from our areas around our country that have suffered from similar circumstances will be considered a priority when applying for funding through these important programs. New, green industries will be able to grow in areas like Lorain and Akron, Ohio, and in Newton, Iowa, as resources are directed where they are needed most. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Chairman, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Vel&#225;zquez, Chairman Gordon, and Chairman Wu for their leadership on this bill, as well as the ranking members for their leadership. 
   This amendment would require agencies that administer Small Business Innovation Research Programs to give special consideration to pressing transportation and infrastructure research activities when reviewing grant applications. 
   The devastating state of this Nation's crumbling infrastructure was demonstrated in dramatic fashion last August when the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River. And it is also demonstrated every day as people drive over potholes in their neighborhoods and sit in traffic jams on our crowded highways as they travel to and from work. 
   Tackling the repair of our Nation's infrastructure is not a glamorous task, but it is absolutely essential to our Nation's long-term success.     
   Investments in infrastructure are critical for public safety and boost local economies by providing more Americans with good-paying jobs. Building our Nation's infrastructure for a new economy and a new century is vital to revamping our work force and revitalizing our communities. 
   It is also crucial that as we rebuild our roads and mass transit systems, we act as stewards of the environment and seek greener and cleaner technologies for fueling our economy. 
   America's working families deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives. This amendment will ensure that as agencies review small business innovation applications they place a premium on projects that focus on transportation and infrastructure, the building blocks of our economy. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

   There was no objection. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I really thank the gentlewoman for her amendment and her efforts to improve this bill. 
   The amendment requires Federal agencies to give priority to SBIR and STTR applications submitted by veterans. During a time when our country is at war, it is particularly appropriate to prioritize SBIR applications submitted by our veterans. And I support this amendment. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Missouri for any comments that he might have.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Chairman, I want to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for her support of this amendment; that would require that we recognize our veterans in this bill. 
   We ask our veterans to sacrifice years of their lives to protect our country and our loved ones. In return, we have made a commitment to honor their service. 
   And last year this Congress provided the largest increase in funding for the VA in history. And this year I am proud that in this bill we will continue to reaffirm our support for the men and women who have chosen to serve their country in uniform. 
   It's our responsibility to ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve. Our veterans also deserve to receive, as I have proposed in this amendment, priority status when applying for awards through the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. 
   This amendment will grant a preference for the brave men and women who have sacrificed for all of us. As they return home and restart their lives, it's essential that the number of veterans who receive SBIR and STTR awards increases. The underlying bill includes a preference as was discussed, for applicants from rural areas and veterans deserve the same consideration. 
   Madam Chairman, 3 million veteran business owners responded to the 2002 survey of business owners administered through the U.S. Census Bureau. This survey revealed that veterans tend to be better educated and slightly older before starting or acquiring their businesses. This trend can undoubtedly be attributed to their time in the service and their use of one of the most important and successful pieces of legislation this body has ever passed, the GI bill. 
   Madam Chairman, our veterans will continue to make us proud as they make good use of the funding available through these important small business programs. As I have often said, it is not enough to simply pay tribute to our veterans with words; we must show them our appreciation with our actions.  
   I appreciate the support that has been expressed for this amendment, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, just over 11 months ago I arrived in these hallowed Halls as a Congresswoman representing the people of Ohio's 13th Congressional district. 
   During my campaign, and now as a Member of Congress, I have spoken with workers and their families in Akron and Lorain and other communities throughout northeast Ohio. And let me tell you about these proud, hardworking people who I am so honored to represent. All they really want is a government that works with them, not against them. They want a good job that will allow them to care for their families, put food on the table, and help them send their children to college. 
   And one of the many things that they understand very clearly is that our global trading system is broken, and our workers, and our businesses, our farmers, and our communities are being left at a devastating disadvantage. 
   In Ohio, we have lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, and that means a lot of families are suffering. And last November, my constituents and the American people across this country, they cast their ballots seeking a new direction on trade. And that's why it is so important that this Congress understand the connection between what we do here today and the impact that will have not only on people's livelihoods, but on their beliefs and on their ideas about what we stand for. 
   Mr. Speaker, people seldom look very hard for things they don't want to find. But Members of this esteemed body should not be so blinded by their yearning to support trade to not recognize the realities of its harmful effects on our families and communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, it may be easy to say that our current trade policies are working when you've not talked to families in Akron, looked into the eyes of their children, or walked down the streets in Lorain. 
   It may be easy to think that our broken system is benefiting our Nation's businesses when you ignore the voices of small businesses in Barberton and Elyria. And it may be easy to think we should continue down a crumbling path when you drown out the concerns of workers in Brunswick and Strongsville and Cuyahoga Falls. 
   But I learned, as we all do when we're young, that if something is broken, you fix it. You really fix it. If something no longer works, develop a new product that fits your needs and allows you to move forward. That's what we need to do with our trade policies. But, unfortunately, that's not what is happening here. 
   Mr. Speaker, the same promises that have been used over and over and over to justify passage of free trade agreement after free trade agreement are being heard here again tonight. Some are pleading that this is an historic breakthrough, and oh, how I wish that that were so. But it is not. And saying it is does not make it so. 
   It's clear that our current trade policies are not working, despite the same past promises made. We see this in the reality of a nearly $1 trillion trade deficit, tainted imported food and products, currency manipulation, illegal subsidies, offshore jobs, and devastated families and communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, we could develop a new model that addresses these issues and puts American workers and businesses in a position to compete on a level playing field and truly raises the standard of living for those in other nations, but, unfortunately, the Peru FTA fails to do this. It locks in problems with food safety, procurement, Social Security privatization, among others. And most importantly, we know very clearly it will not be enforced. 
   Just look at one of the agreement's strongest supporters, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They were very encouraged that the labor provisions in the bill could not be read to ``require compliance.'' And today, in The Washington Post, we learned from the Columbia law professor, Mark Barenberg, that the Peru FTA actually imposes lighter sanctions for labor standard violations than current trade law requires. Now, proponents will say that's not true. But that's what Columbia Law Professor Mark Barenberg says. The Peru FTA actually imposes lighter sanctions for labor standard violations than current trade law requires. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, what are we going to do today for my constituents and those who elected us to move in a new direction on trade? 
   What will be the true legacy of this historic Congress? Will it be our legacy to pass more harmful trade policies and trade agreements like the one before us? Or will it be a different course, one of fairness, one of justice, one that will allow our workers and business a truly fair playing field? 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the agreement.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this very important matter. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, which we must pass here today. After 8 years of failed policies and economic pain, the families in my district and across Ohio are trying to hang on. 
   Since 2001, 1,087 Ohio factories, companies and operations have shut down or had massive layoffs. That is one company shutting down or laying off workers every 2 1/2 days for 8 straight years. That is an average of 61 jobs lost each day due to shutdowns or layoffs. In fact, since 2001, Ohio has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs alone, and now our State's unemployment rate is 7.4 percent, nearly double the 2001 level. 
   In order to keep our families strong and workers competitive, we must extend these unemployment benefits. 
   Madam Speaker, 22,478 unemployed workers in my home State of Ohio will lose their benefits in October, and a total of 34,389 will lose their benefits between October and December, right before the holidays. 
   Madam Speaker, we must act here to pass this bill with the same sense of urgency to help our families as we did to pass the economic recovery package just voted on to free up the credit markets. Extending these unemployment benefits is critical. We must extend them to help our workers who are struggling to find jobs.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I support the TAA reauthorization and appreciate the important improvements this legislation makes in the program. But, unfortunately, there's a larger problem at work, and TAA only addresses the symptoms, not the cause. 
   So-called free trade has been anything but free. Our current trade policies have been devastating for communities in northeast Ohio and across this Nation. One only has to look at our record trade deficit and this growing TAA program to see this reality. 
   Madam Speaker, people across this country know that our trading system is broken. The fact is TAA became necessary because this country kept entering into unfair and harmful trade agreements that cost American workers their jobs and hurt businesses and communities. 
   While reauthorizing and improving the TAA program is important, what our working families really need are trade policies that do not jeopardize American jobs in the first place. 
   In just the last 7 years, we've lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs in this country, and more than 200,000 in Ohio alone. Some estimates attribute more than 50,000 of Ohio's job losses directly to NAFTA. And we've seen the consequence of this job loss in the record numbers of families in foreclosure, and in families falling off of the health care rolls, and families sustaining benefits going out the window. These are families full of proud, hardworking Americans who have had their futures and opportunities undercut by our trade policies. It doesn't have to be that way. This country owes these workers the kind of assistance TAA aims to offer, because we must remember that very often it was our Nation's broken policies that set in motion the loss of their jobs. And because of this, it's this government's moral responsibility to try and help them land on their feet. 
   But wouldn't it have been better if those jobs had never been lost? And wouldn't it be better, Madam Speaker, to fix our broken policies so that they no longer allow other countries to engage in unfair trade tactics that leave U.S. businesses at a disadvantage and U.S. workers out of jobs? 
   This reauthorization bill recognizes the disastrous consequences that poorly conceived trade agreements such as NAFTA, CAFTA and the proposed Peru, Colombia, Panama and South Korean free trade agreements have had and will continue to have for our manufacturing and service industries. 
   Make no mistake. Our policies must not just sound good on paper. They must work for our businesses, our workers, our farmers, and our communities. Indeed, they must work and be fair to this country. If this Congress does not act on this reality which is being felt in places like Lorain and Akron and in districts across this country, we'll need more and more TAA programs every year as more and more American workers are let down by a broken and mismanaged system. 
   Madam Speaker, all the good intentions and helpful programs in TAA cannot disguise the fact that we're going about things backwards. We should start with American workers and communities, and end with multinational corporations, not the other way around. We must make sure that our trade policies do not leave our businesses and workers at an unfair disadvantage or provide incentives to move jobs offshore. 
   Many displaced workers have been turned away from TAA in Ohio in the past, due to chronic underfunding and complex eligibility rules and requirements. And for others it's been very difficult finding new good-paying jobs to support their families. In Ohio, only 65 percent of workers laid off between 2003 and 2005 had found new jobs by 2006, and only two-thirds of those jobs were remotely of similar pay. 
   And while the improved funding and expansions provided by this bill are welcome and certainly overdue, the most important message we should take away from this TAA reauthorization is the fact that it recognizes how much damage has been caused by our broken trade policies. 
   We should reauthorize this program, and I certainly appreciate the improvements in the bill. But as I said earlier, TAA only addresses the symptoms, not the cause. 
   We know what the problems are, and American workers and businesses are facing them every day. It is time for this Congress to step up and recognize the reality that millions of Americans are facing these issues due to our broken trade policies and finally take real and effective action.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Spratt for his leadership and for yielding me this time. 
   As the only freshman Democrat on the Budget Committee, I rise to urge my fellow freshmen and all of my colleagues to support the Democratic budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, last November, the American people made it clear that they are ready for a government that will be fiscally responsible. This Nation spoke loud and clear when they elected us and put a new party in power in Congress. They are asking for responsibility and a new direction in our fiscal priorities. Education, health care, the care of our children and our seniors and our veterans, these are issues that Americans care about. 
   Our budget restores common sense to our national spending and sanity to our national priorities. It restores the President's attempt to cut children's health care programs and community block grants. It puts forth the single largest increase in veteran spending in our Nation's history and not a moment too soon. It funds math and science programs for our kids, programs like Head Start and Pell grants that provide access to education that so many of our children need. And this budget concerns itself with the need to create jobs and build a bright economic future. It restores funding for job training programs, and it does so while adhering to the PAYGO rules. 
   It has been a long 6 years for this Nation. Just 6 years ago, we were looking at a projected $5.6 trillion surplus. That has collapsed into a $9 trillion deficit. Every American in this country owes $29,000 worth of debt. 
   Under Republican leadership, the budget became woefully out of balance fiscally and out of balance with the priorities of the American people. The people elected us to take this country in a new direction. This budget will do so, and it will do so in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is time for Congress to be accountable to the American people again.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 249, WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 331 provides for consideration of H.R. 249, to restore the prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros, under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule requires that any amendments to the bill must be preprinted in the Congressional Record prior to their consideration. The rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 249 is a bipartisan bill that restores important protections for wild horses and burros from sale and slaughter. This bill is necessary because these long-standing protections were stripped by a rider inserted into the 2005 omnibus spending bill without a hearing or debate. 
   The transportation practices faced by these wild horses and burros are cruel and inhumane. They are transferred hundreds or thousands of miles in cramped quarters, just so their meat can be consumed in foreign markets. H.R. 249 bans the sale of wild horses and burros by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as the transfer of these animals for the purpose of processing into commercial products. 
   Over the last 2 years, the House has voted twice on this issue, and these passed either unanimously or overwhelmingly. But they have never been signed into law. It is time we end this inhumane practice once and for all. 
   Since the enactment of these protections through the passage of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971, we have seen wild horse populations fall by more than 50 percent. These animals cannot wait any longer for us to reaffirm our commitment to the protections we promised 34 years ago. 
   As an animal lover, I am deeply disturbed and opposed to suffering inflicted on animals and will work against practices that lead to their torture or injury. That is why we must pass this rule and pass H.R. 249. These animals need protection, and it is time we restored it for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support of the underlying measure. 
   This House, in a bipartisan manner, has demonstrated its strong support for our wild horses and burros twice over the last 2 years. There is no reason we cannot continue this strong commitment to protecting these animals here again today. This is a commonsense issue that must be addressed. No longer can we ignore the inhumane treatment inflicted upon these wonderful and beautiful animals. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4847, UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1071 provides for consideration of H.R. 4847, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, controlled by the Committee on Science and Technology, and makes in order all three amendments that were submitted for consideration. I am proud to rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, twenty-seven years ago, in 1971, over 12,000 citizens and more than 250 firefighters tragically lost their lives due to fires. In response to those tragic occurrences, this body passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act into law, establishing the United States Fire Administration, also known as the USFA, and the National Fire Academy, known as the NFA. The USFA was created to reduce the incidence of death, injury and property loss from fire through public education, data collection, research and training. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have made great progress. Since the creation of the USFA in 1974, the number of fire deaths has been reduced by more than one-half. Besides providing training and educational programs for over 30,000 fire departments across this great Nation, the USFA promotes fire safety and prevention programs to the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, these educational and outreach programs undoubtedly have saved thousands of lives and thousands of dollars, and will continue to do so. 
   Reports published by the USFA provide essential information to help reduce the risk of fires. For example, the USFA releases a report in December to encourage fire safety during the holiday season. According to last year's report, ``Fires occurring during the holiday season claimed the lives of over 400 people, injured more than 1,650, and caused $990 million in damage.'' The report outlines precautionary tests to help American families avoid devastating but often preventable accidents. 
   The USFA also collects reliable data on civilian and firefighter deaths and injuries. In 2006, there were 3,245 civilian deaths from fires and 81 percent of all civilian fire deaths occurred in residences, which represents 25 percent of all fires. Direct property loss due to fires was approximately $11.3 billion, $755 million of which was the result of 31,000 intentionally-set structure fires. 
   Mr. Speaker, sadly, 106 firefighters were killed in the line of duty in 2006. For nearly 30 years, the USFA has collected data on the number and causes of firefighter fatalities. The analysis of this invaluable research allows the USFA to find solutions to specific problems and reduce the number of fatalities with our firefighters. 
   While the number of firefighter deaths has been greatly reduced, approximately 100 brave firefighters make the ultimate sacrifice to protect our loved ones and our communities each year. We must continue to strive to prevent fires, to learn the lessons from unpreventable fires, and to properly train and equip our firefighters. It is vital that our Federal Government ensure that our brave firefighters have  the training and the support they need to keep our families and communities safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, this reauthorization bill will promote national consensus standards for safe fire fighting at all levels of Government. H.R. 4847 will also help to provide training for firefighters who are increasingly called on to handle modern-day challenges and catastrophes, including fire fighting in the wildland-urban interface and responding to hazardous material incidents. 
   Firefighters are the first on the scene and the last to leave. Captain Robert Livingston echoed these sentiments in his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation when he said, ``The days of firefighters whose primary function was to `put the wet stuff on the red stuff' are long gone. The men and women of the 21st century fire service have evolved into highly-trained, highly-skilled all-purpose emergency responders with broad responsibilities.'' 
   Firefighters in my district know this all too well. With the recent and reoccurring damaging floods in cities like Barberton, North Royalton, Elyria and Lorain, our firefighters have been called upon to provide emergency flood assistance. And we must never forget, Mr. Speaker, the heroics our Nation witnessed on September 11th as these brave men and women ran into the Twin Towers to save as many people as possible. Three hundred forty-one of New York City's finest firefighters, three fire safety directors, two paramedics and one volunteer firefighter died in the line of duty at the World Trade Center on that fatal day. 
   It is our responsibility to provide the resources necessary to train those who protect us, and today, with passage of this act, we will be providing the support to meet the needs of our firefighters for the 21st century. By reauthorizing and improving this act, we are ensuring that the USFA continues to provide training, education and the tools to the firefighters we entrust to protect our communities and our families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to, if I could, just mention this bill. The bill has such wide support, not only within this Congress, but it has been endorsed by some extraordinarily important organizations out there. It has been endorsed by the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the International Fire Service Training Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the North American Fire Training Directors. So this bill has wide support and on both sides of the aisle.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, we have heard on this floor today why we must pass this rule and pass the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act. 
   As I have said, we must continue to support firefighters in communities like Sheffield Lake, Brunswick, and Akron, and all across this Nation, and ensure that they have the resources available to do their job to protect our loved ones and our communities. 
   This bill authorizes appropriations for the fiscal year 2009-2012 for the USFA in the responsible manner the American people expect of Congress. According to the Congressional Budget Office, enacting this legislation will not affect direct spending or revenues, and will impose no costs on State, local, or tribal governments. 
   H.R. 4847 expands the list of training activities the National Fire Academy is authorized to engage in, which will  help our firefighters manage the demands of the 21st century. These programs include response activities to all types of national catastrophes; exposure of hazardous materials; and increased emergency medical services. This bill also authorizes the USFA to assist the Nation's fire services by improving equipment and sharing best practices to address fire suppression and prevention. 
   This bill was passed by a voice vote by the Science and Technology Committee with bipartisan support, and has been endorsed by the International Association of Firefighters. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

   The resolution was agreed to.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for his introduction here and I thank you for your leadership. The gentleman from Kentucky is taking us, hopefully, on what will be a bipartisan effort to restore the responsibilities of this Congress has under article I and just sort of bring that back to the forefront because checks and balances are very important in this government. I also want to commend the leadership of our president, TIM WALZ, the gentleman from Minnesota, who is an outspoken advocate for the people that he represents, and, frankly, that's what article I is all about. 
   As you point out, when we were elected to Congress, we were elected to represent the people of our districts. Not lobbyists on K Street and not operatives at the White House or even the President himself. Our responsibility and our loyalty are to the Americans, the people, first and foremost, who sent us here. That means we have to do the job that they asked us to do. And that job is important, and we know exactly what that job is because article I in some ways is a job description. As you point out, it's not about really just authority; it's about responsibilities. Nowhere in that job description in article I does it say we have to protect egos or political interests of the executive branch. Nowhere does it say that we have to do only things that the President tells us to do. And nowhere in that job description does it say that Congress answers to anyone but the American people. 
   There has sort of been a slope here where past Congresses have ceded legislative power to the executive branch, and, frankly, I believe that when that happens, Congress is falling down on their job. I am really glad that we are here tonight to reinvigorate and rededicate ourselves to make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations and our function under article I because it is vitally important to so many issues, from the war in Iraq to all these judiciary issues.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman. What great points, and thank you for reading that because we can all use sort of that reminder that the Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of an imperial Presidency where edicts from the White House might carry more weight than laws passed in Congress or rulings handed down by the court. And that is what we are here to do, to get things back in balance. 
   Unfortunately, as we have sort of expressed earlier, some of us, that the White House at present has routinely refused to provide information to the Congress. As the gentleman from Minnesota points out, that is not what was envisioned when our Founding Fathers put together the fantastic, amazing, living document that we are here today to reclaim. 
   Earlier this month, I heard testimony from executive branch witnesses that they were refusing to answer questions before Congress on whether or not there is corruption in the Iraqi Government. We hear this right after we hear our distinguished colleague from New York talking so eloquently about what he saw and what he witnessed. And we hear about our responsibility to come forth with the knowledge that we gain when we go to Iraq and I, too, have visited Iraq. We hear witnesses come in, though, from the administration when you start to ask questions about corruption that may be going on in that country, where we have paid, those of us here, the American soldiers, the troops, the price that they have paid. You speak so eloquently of them, Congressman Hall, and their dedication and their heart. I have to tell you, they are breathtaking to watch in action. But we have to question if money is missing. We have to question when equipment is missing because the troops pay a price. The American people are paying a price for what we are doing in Iraq. 
   At any rate, the reality of an administration that instead of providing information so that we can investigate, they stonewalled providing information and in that case and in so many other cases, and I am sure others are going to mention them, it is our responsibility to ask the questions, to get the information and make sure that we make policies that are worthy of those soldiers and are worthy of the American people. 
   I am so proud to be here with you all tonight, the members of the freshman class as we begin this campaign to reclaim our responsibility. Before I yield back, I just want to mention one thing that was striking. The gentleman from Minnesota mentioned that the President has rights under article II. But I think that we would all be better served that rather than thinking of the President having rights, he should think of them as responsibilities, because they are not personal rights. It is a job description for him, too, in article II.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1852, EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this issue and on this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of this rule and in strong support of the underlying legislation, the Expanding American Homeownership Act. 
   Owning a home in this country is called the American Dream for many reasons: the pride of ownership, a sense of responsibility, the feeling of settling down and belonging to a community and a neighborhood. But the American Dream is in peril for many families in this country as foreclosures rise and dreams shatter. 
   I am sorry to report, Mr. Speaker, that in my home State of Ohio, we have the Nation's highest rate of mortgages that are seriously delinquent or in the foreclosure process. In April of this year, Ohio had nearly 12,000 default notices, auction sale notifications, and bank repositions. Sadly, one in ten Ohio homeowners with a mortgage is at least a month behind in payments and one in four with a subprime loan is delinquent or in foreclosure. 
   These staggering statistics are not just numbers. They are families and individuals whose American Dream is quickly becoming a nightmare. I have talked with many hardworking, proud families who are struggling to pay their mortgages and afford health insurance, struggling to put food on the table and pay for their children's college education. They are working hard and they are playing by the rules, but nonetheless the American Dream has moved out of their reach. 
   The homeownership crisis is part of a larger problem for our Nation where policies and laws have not worked for our low- and middle-class families the way that they should. This is unacceptable for my constituents, and it should be unacceptable for a Nation built by working men and women that prides itself on ownership, responsibility and fairness. 
   Mr. Speaker, the problems in the housing market are not new, but they have become what they are because of a lack of action and leadership from prior Congresses and this administration. The lack of oversight has led to the abuse of a mortgage system by unscrupulous lenders and others looking for easy profit by preying upon those who are most vulnerable. And it is wholly unacceptable that a system that should be an avenue to homeownership has instead become a path to heartache for far too many families. 
   Today by passing the Expanding America Homeownership Act, we take a bold step forward on what is going to be a long road to fix this broken system.     
   H.R. 1852 raises loan limits, helps reduce the burden for high-risk borrowers, expands counseling for home buyers, and provides new ownership incentives for low-income families. And these are very important and positive measures. 
   This is a demonstration of our commitment to restore the American Dream, but we also understand that there is no easy fix for this issue. In coming days, I plan to introduce legislation that will bring together many interests and groups involved in foreclosure and mortgage lending crisis so that we can continue to act to improve this situation. I hope that, working together, we will be able to quickly offer comprehensive and meaningful solutions to move forward. 
   A similar effort has been made in Ohio spurred by our new Governor, Ted Strickland. And just recently, they came back with some very important recommendations that will hopefully make a meaningful impact in the State. But we here in Congress at the Federal level need to do our part. 
   Mr. Speaker, never again do I want to have to hear that a family has lost their home simply because our laws and regulations have worked against them. 
   I urge passage of this rule and the underlying legislation.

I am so happy as a new Member of Congress to be here to join him and support this legislation today, because it is about fairness for those on the front lines protecting our neighborhoods and communities, our firefighters and law enforcement officers. 
   This bill is about ensuring these public safety employees, these heroes, have the right to ensure their voices are heard in the workplace. Not only do they deserve this right, we owe it to these public servants who risk their lives and put their safety on the line every day to protect our families and our communities. 
   Our legislation simply gives them the same rights that so many other workers around this Nation retain. These people who put the public first deserve to be heard on the matters that affect their livelihood. 
   For our firefighters, police officers, EMTs and other public safety officers, let's rise beyond the words of support, pass this bill, and make it clear that we respect and admire the work and sacrifice of these brave men and women.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, Senator John McCain admitted months ago that he wasn't an expert on the economy. And that certainly explained his comments earlier this month when he declared, ``You can make the argument that there's been great progress economically'' over the last 7 years. Great economic progress? 
   Clearly, Senator McCain has not been talking with the middle class families across America who overwhelmingly believe they are worse off today than they were when President Bush took office in January of 2001. And there is a good reason they're feeling that way. Since January of 2001, health care premiums have increased by more than $5,000 per year for the average middle class family, while college costs for their children have shot up $2,500 a year for a public university. 
   Middle class families are finding it increasingly difficult to find the money for these skyrocketing costs, considering the average median income has actually fallen by more than $900 over the last 7 years. And Senator McCain calls this economic progress? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American middle class cannot afford another 4 years of failed Republican leadership in the White House.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF RICHARD L. AYNES, DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON SCHOOL OF LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, today it's my honor to rise to recognize Richard L. Aynes. 
   On June 30, Richard Aynes concluded his term as dean of the University of Akron School of Law after 12 complete years, the longest tenure of any current law dean in the great State of Ohio and longer than 184 of the 196 deans at ABA accredited schools. His dedicated service is especially gratifying to me, as I earned my juris doctorate from the University of Akron School of Law. 
   Since 1921, I and more than 6,000 people have selected the University of Akron for law school. With Richard Aynes serving as dean, newspaper headlines acclaimed our law school as ``on the move'' and as having ``raised the bar.'' Today, as Richard ends his service as dean, he leaves the University of Akron School of Law as one of the top 50 law schools in the Nation. That is a great accomplishment. 
   Under Dean Aynes' leadership, applicants to the School of Law increased from 1,621 in 1995 to 2,230 in 2006, while the student-to-faculty ratio decreased. Those of us fortunate enough to live near Akron have always known and recognized the greatness of our law school, but Dean Aynes successfully spread that appeal throughout the Nation. 
   The 2006 student body is composed of students from 37 States. He also oversaw the expansion of innovative programs to deal with our changing world. The School of Law now boasts the world-renowned Center for Intellectual Property Law and Technology, and I'm proud that my alma mater is the first school in the State of Ohio to offer a master of law in intellectual property law and one of only 17 such programs across the country. 
   In a true testament to his devotion to both law and education, I'm pleased to report that Dean Aynes will return to the law faculty in the spring semester of 2008 to teach and publish. In this role, he will continue his tireless efforts towards the progress of the school and will profoundly touch the lives of future lawyers and our community. It is in recognition and gratitude that I rise today to honor this great man. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, I want to express my deep personal appreciation for the compassion he extended to me during a challenging time that I faced during my experience at the University of Akron School of Law. You see, Mr. Speaker, during the first year of my legal studies, we received the sad, sad news that my father was suffering from lung cancer, and I shall always appreciate the compassion and the help that Dean Aynes and other caring professional faculty at the law school extended to me. It was that compassion and encouragement that made it possible for me to spend precious time with my dad in those precious final days of his life while continuing on with my legal studies and on a path that would lead me here to the United States House of Representatives, where I have the extraordinary honor to put that education to work in service to the fine people of the 13th District of Ohio. 
   Thank you, Dean Aynes, and may your commitment and achievements continue to inspire and motivate countless generations.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 531 provides for consideration of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking  member of the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for a single amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Representative McKeon of California or his designee. 
   Mr. Speaker, educational opportunity is the backbone of what we are about and everything that makes this Nation great. For this reason, I am very pleased to support the rule and the underlying legislation that will give our students a real opportunity to go to college and give them the vital tools necessary to prepare them to enter the workforce and build a positive future. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act addresses one of the most important and difficult issues facing our Nation. While access to higher education is more critical than ever for our younger generations, the cost is rapidly moving out of reach for many low- and middle-income families. This problem is nothing less than a crisis. How many students have had their dreams shattered because they could not afford their tuition? And how much potential has our Nation lost because of the failure to address this issue? 
   If students cannot afford to get the education and training necessary for them to make a productive and positive impact in our communities, it hurts us all. Investment in our younger generations not only improves their future, but it helps our economy and our retired workers whom they will help to support. It ensures our national security, continued improvements in health outcomes as well as advances in manufacturing and technology. Improving access to higher education is not only about helping America's middle class and our students and families who are in need. It is about strengthening America. 
   But instead of helping our students prepare themselves for a better future, recent Congresses and the administration chose to cut funding for student loan programs and have allowed this issue to become the crisis it is today. It is time for priorities to change, and this bill is part of making that happen. 
   Tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges and universities have risen 41 percent after inflation since 2001. The typical American student now graduates from college with $17,500 worth of debt. If we do not take action immediately, financial barriers will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade. This Congress has a responsibility to help our students and our working families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed the heartbreak of parents who work hard day in and day out who have to tell their child that they cannot afford to send them to college. I have listened to these struggling parents and heard the ache in their voices. It is a story that is far too common. It is unacceptable and we must take action. And today we do. 
   H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act, will provide the single largest increase in college aid since the GI bill, and it will put college education back within reach of so many families. H.R. 2669 follows on the College Student Relief Act that passed overwhelmingly, 356-71, in this new Congress earlier this year. That bill cut interest rates in half on subsidized student loans over the next 5 years. For the average student in the State of Ohio at institutions like the University of Akron and Lorain Community College, this means a savings of roughly $4,320 once the cuts are phased in. It is estimated that our proposal will help roughly 175,000 students just in Ohio alone and 5.5 million nationwide. Our bill increases the maximum Pell grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next 5 years while also expanding eligibility to include and serve more students with financial need. In Ohio, roughly 224,000 students will benefit from these changes to the Pell grant program. And nationwide, over 5.7 million students will benefit and another 600,000 will become eligible for the grants, making the possibility of a college education for them a reality. 
   Additionally, this legislation recognizes the value of our public servants, and it shows how much we respect what they do. Individuals working jobs that make our world turn, teachers and firefighters, nurses, law enforcement officers, librarians, we provide upfront tuition assistance to qualified undergraduate students who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities or high-need subject areas. And we provide loan forgiveness for first responders, law enforcement officers, firefighters, nurses, public defenders, prosecutors, early childhood educators, librarians and others. We are investing not only in the potential of individual students, Mr. Speaker. We are investing in the strength of our communities and our country. And the return on our investment as a Nation and our students and people will, without question, provide an enormous return. 
   But our failure to invest likewise will have incredibly harmful consequences. Our bill makes clear we understand the importance of this investment. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, to make a good bill even better, the College Cost Reduction Act will benefit all of these students and families at no new cost to taxpayers. We make these important investments in education through government spending cuts. With this bill, we take the billions of access taxpayer subsidies that have gone into the profit margins of private lenders and invest it in direct support for our students. Overall, H.R. 2669 will save almost $20 billion in taxpayer money and reinvest that money in the needs of our students. This is about where the priorities of our Nation and this Congress lie. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the lack of access to higher education is a crisis for our Nation, and it is a burden that no family in this great country should have to bear. The College Cost Reduction Act puts us in a position to help these families and assist our students who simply want to learn and be prepared to enter the workforce and contribute to society. This bill does more than just pay lip service to the virtue of a college education. Today we act to help families, students and our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   We have heard here today why we must pass this rule and pass the College Cost Reduction Act, and I wanted to commend and thank Chairman Miller for his tremendous leadership in getting this done.     
   As I said earlier, educational opportunity is the backbone of our Nation, and our students, our families and our country have waited long enough for this to happen. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side who seem intent on further delay, 12 years of Republican rule provided ample opportunity to act on this issue and pass a bill, to act on amendments. The American people cannot wait any longer. 
   This is an issue that many of us here in Congress hear about when we return to our districts because a lot of families are worrying about how they will pay for their children's education, and today, we are going to work with them. Their government is going to work with them and not against them. 
   I'd like to share today on the floor a letter that I bet mirrors letters that every one of our Members receives. This is a letter that came to me from a constituent, and I will share part of it. 
   It says: ``Is anything ever going to be done about the exorbitant cost of a college education in this country? How are the middle class supposed to save for retirement and also pay the exorbitant cost of a college education for our children? 
   ``This country seems to be obsessed with debt, because the colleges and the high schools as well, tell you that you should expect to be in a certain amount of debt upon graduation from college. I guess if you're wealthy, it's not an issue. So the middle class are the ones that are left struggling. 
   ``With such an importance put on having a college education to get a decent paying job in this country, how are our children supposed to be able to afford a home and car upon graduation from college when they will be so far in debt with student loans? 
   ``As for the parents, any raises we receive go toward the continually increasing cost of medical insurance, gasoline, utilities, property taxes, et cetera. I know, in my own case, we seem to be going backwards instead of forward, and we by no means live extravagantly or beyond our means. 
   ``I am looking forward to hearing from you.'' 
   Well, today, this constituent hears from me and hears from this Congress, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule. 
   For my constituent and her daughter, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the kind gentleman from California for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of raising the minimum wage to help our working families. In November, many Americans cast their votes for change because they were tired of the economic injustices working families have suffered over the last decade. Those who went to the polls want action on a clean bill from a Congress that has failed to raise the Federal minimum wage for nearly 10 years. 
   Voters in Ohio and five other States who believed in our democracy passed minimum wage increases. This is not only about increasing wages, it is about changing the way we treat our working men and women. And it is about traditional American values of fairness and opportunity. It is about paying rent, putting food on the table and paying for our children to go to college. 
   Mr. Speaker, the voters have given us a mandate. This is part of America's agenda. Today we act mindful of that mandate to help working families across this Nation by raising the minimum wage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding such time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the action we take today to cut interest rates on student loans for 5.5 million of our students most in need of financial assistance. This cut is vital because there is nothing more important than ensuring our students are well prepared to enter the workforce.     
   Many students in our Nation lack access to affordable higher education, and this has to be considered a crisis. While access to higher education has become more critical for our younger generation, the cost is rapidly moving out of reach for many low-income and middle-class families in this country. 
   Tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges and universities have risen 41 percent, after inflation, since 2001. The typical American student now graduates from college $17,500 in debt. This Congress, past Congresses, should be ashamed that financial barriers will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade if we continue on this course. Costs will also prevent another 2 million high school graduates from attending any college at all. 
   Amazingly, instead of helping our students prepare themselves for a better future, recent Congresses have cut funding for student loan programs. With this step, we begin today to reverse that trend, which has hurt our students and has hurt our economic well-being as a Nation. 
   Despite what we may hear from some on the other side of the aisle, our proposal to cut student loan rates in half, in half, will help roughly 175,000 students in the State of Ohio, at universities like the University of Akron and Lorain Community College in my district. Starting this year, it is estimated that these students will save over $2,200 over the life of their loan, and that savings number is expected to increase to over $4,300 starting in 2011. 
   This is about opportunity, Mr. Speaker. Investment in our younger generations not only helps their future, but it helps our economy and our retired workers whom they will support. Cutting interest rates on student loans is not only about strengthening America's middle class and improving access to higher education for our students and families who are most in need, it is about strengthening America. 
   Education is the backbone of what we are about and everything that makes our Nation great. Let us pass H.R. 5 and give our students the opportunity they deserve and the American people what they have asked for through these recent elections. Today, we deliver on a promise.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   All of us in this Chamber and in this Nation support our troops. They have fought bravely, with love of this great country uppermost in their hearts. They have done all that we have asked them to do. They have done their job well. And now in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, we must do ours. 
   The President has indicated that he thinks this war will continue for another decade. But, Mr. Speaker, we must not concede to a 10-year war. Over 3,850 brave American lives have been lost; 163 Ohio soldiers have been killed; more than 28,000 of our Nation's finest have been wounded. The year 2007 has been the deadliest year since U.S. troops began this war 4 1/2 years ago. 
   Our troops have been stretched woefully thin, exposing this Nation to greater risk, not less. We have already spent over $450 billion on the war in Iraq. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the President's war policies could cost $2.4 trillion in the next decade. And the President insists in getting that money that it come with no strings, no oversight, no accountability, no questions asked. And, in return, he offers to the American people and to our brave troops no end in sight. It is time for a new direction. We must not proceed further down the road to a 10-year war. 
   This bill requires a transition in the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq from combat to force and diplomatic protection. It provides for targeted counterterrorism operations. And this bill prohibits deployment to Iraq of troops who are not fully equipped and fully trained. It prohibits the use of torture, as described in the Army Field Manual. And it changes direction from the 10-year war plan being offered by the President toward a responsible plan redeploying our troops, while providing our troops with the resources they need. 
   When I visited Iraq, I saw some of the hardships and the obstacles our troops face, and I also saw the commitment and dedication in each of those men and women. They truly took my breath away. They deserve a policy that is worthy of their commitment and their sacrifice. 
   The bill before us today gives our troops the support, the equipment, the training they need to responsibly redeploy. It repairs the readiness of our military and refocuses our efforts on fighting terrorism around the world. 
   Last November, people across the Nation cast their ballots seeking a change in direction. After more than 4 years and countless taxpayer dollars, this Congress has a responsibility to tell this President that the status quo is not acceptable. It's time to bring a responsible end to the war in Iraq and to focus on fighting terrorism and protecting the Nation.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in strong support of the rules package. 
   Trust is a fragile thing. It is difficult to win, but easy to lose. It finds its hold on promises kept and honesty sustained and unquestionable integrity. 
   As the representative of the 13th District of Ohio, I am honored to rise on  this historic day to speak for the first time on the floor of the people's House. 
   And in so rising, I am proud that I do so to keep the faith with the people who sent me here to serve. 
   With our actions today, on this first day of the reform Congress, we begin to fulfill the awesome responsibility entrusted to us by the American people. 
   We have heard the call for change and it shall be heeded. Today, we sever the links between those who would buy influence on Capitol Hill and those who would willingly sell it. 
   We act to clean up the corruption which has eroded the public trust and resulted in far too many policies that benefit the well connected and the privileged few, at the expense of the greater good. 
   Title II of our rules package does just this. We end the K Street Project, which took peddling of access and influence to soaring new heights. We act to eradicate the cronyism and corruption. We cut off the gifts, the perks and travel wielded by special interests. We take the darkest inner workings of government and sanitize them with the light of day. 
   We will work to adopt this set of anti-corruption reforms to dismantle the dark corridors and backrooms and avenues to abuse that have allowed corruption to grow and flourish. 
   We will beat back the culture and abuses that have hurt the American people, both in policy and in spirit. 
   Today, we heed the call to put a halt to the corruption that has tarnished this House. 
   Trust is a fragile, sacred thing. And we, in the new 110th Congress, will protect it with all the power of our office.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2693, POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 678 provides for consideration of H.R. 2693, the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order the Committee on Education and Labor amendment in the nature of a substitute now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. 
   The rule makes in order the two amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee and are printed in the Rules report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the rule and in favor of H.R. 2693, the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act. 
   The central Ohio town of Marion is located about two hours from my hometown of Barberton, Ohio. Marion has the unique distinction of being known as the ``Popcorn Capital of the World.'' Just this month, the town of Marion hosted its yearly popcorn festival, complete with a popcorn scholarship pageant, parade and 5K run. 
   Unfortunately, these fun-filled festivities are not the only symbols of Marion's popcorn industry. It was recently discovered that a chemical used in the production of microwave popcorn is the cause of fatal lung disease in popcorn workers across the country, including the Popcorn Capital of the World, Marion Ohio. 
   Diacetyl is a chemical ingredient used in microwave popcorn that gives the popcorn a distinct buttery smell.     
   Diacetyl has been linked to illnesses in hundreds of workers in popcorn and other food production facilities across the United States. Diacetyl is specifically connected to a lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans. This condition makes it difficult for air to flow out of the lungs. This difficulty is not reversible, and it is sometimes fatal. 
   In November of 2000, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted voluntary tests of workers at a popcorn plant in Missouri. The workers in that plant suffered from chronic cough and shortness of breath almost three times as often as people in the general population. Those plant workers are over three times more likely to suffer from abnormally low airflow through their lungs. The percentage of workers in the popcorn plant with asthma or chronic bronchitis was double the national rate. Several workers from this plant in Missouri had conditions that were so severe that they had to be placed on the lung transplant list. 
   Remarkably, Mr. Speaker, despite these reports from the Missouri popcorn plant and other plants across the country, there are currently no enforceable OSHA standards requiring exposure to diacetyl to be controlled. 
   It has been 7 years since the first cases of popcorn lung were identified. It has been 5 years since the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health published its first report stating the inhalation of diacetyl was leading to deadly results. There is simply no excuse for the lack of action taken by OSHA in the face of this evidence. OSHA has failed to uphold its primary charge to protect the safety and health of American workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation fills that fatal void by protecting workers from this damaging chemical. The Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act directs the Secretary of Labor to create standards for workers' exposure to diacetyl in popcorn plants and in any location where diacetyl is used or manufactured. Our legislation requires that final rules for exposure to diacetyl be in place under the Occupational Safety and Health Act no later than 2 years after the bill is enacted. 
   For the popcorn workers of Marion, Ohio, things are starting to look up. The popcorn factories in their town have eliminated the use of diacetyl because of its linkage to the fatal lung conditions. They have done the right thing. 
   But not every production facility that uses diacetyl has recognized the danger. In fact, on Monday of this week, one of America's largest food manufacturers introduced their new toasted butter flavoring. What is one of the ingredients in this new butter flavoring? Diacetyl. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that some food manufacturers have gotten the message, but some are going to continue to ignore the science and put their workers in harm's way. Over 500 workers in Ohio are already suffering because of uncontrolled exposure to diacetyl. 
   Today, we act to protect our food industry workers from these harmful chemicals and dangerous conditions. We stand up for workers and their families. This legislation is not just about the conditions in food manufacturing plants across this country. It's about changing the way we treat working men and women. It's about respecting the risks that they undertake every day to feed their family. The hardworking people who make our world turn deserve safe working conditions, a living wage, and strong support from Congress. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the underlying bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, let me begin with a point of clarification; the earmark rule was not waived. And to the question about whether this bill today is premature, I would argue that it's not premature for the 500 workers in Ohio and those across this country who are now suffering from this irreversible disease. 
   I have heard the workers' stories from the Ohio popcorn plants. I have heard the story of a worker who worked 12-hour shifts in the popcorn factory outside of Marion, Ohio. His job was to mix the flavors, measuring and dumping butter-flavored powders and pastes into the vats of soybean oil. Now, Mr. Speaker, he is so crippled from breathing the vapors in the plant that he hardly has the strength to hold his granddaughter. He is racked with spasms that leave him dizzy and incapacitated. 
   In 2001, after an outbreak of diseases at the popcorn factory in Missouri, his employer guaranteed him that his plant was safe. Mr. Speaker, OSHA's failure to protect our workers by ignoring the reports, studies and warning signs has endangered the health of families. That is why we must act today. Our workers should never have to choose between their health and feeding their families. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, let us recall what this is all about. We are here today because the now-resigned Chief of Staff to former attorney, Alberto Gonzalez, ran a plan over a period of just under 2 years during which he maintained a revised list of U.S. attorneys to be fired or retained. If prosecutors were placed on this list for political reasons, or alternatively kept off because of a willingness to engage in political prosecutions, these actions are not only improper and illegal, but they constitute criminal abuse. These are serious allegations, and we have a constitutional duty to pursue this proceeding today. 
   Congress is not only entitled to look into this matter, we must conduct a thorough oversight of the executive branch. Now, some of my colleagues argue that the United States attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. However, it is very critical to note that throwing out this term, ``at the pleasure of the President,'' may be accurate in the sense that the President may fire somebody for no reason, Alberto Gonzalez can fire somebody for no reason, but they can't fire him for an illegal reason. 
   And that is what we are looking at here. The Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Conyers testified yesterday that he pursued documents from the White House and the testimony of Ms. Miers and from Mr. Bolten for 8 long months, and in return the White House did not provide a single document and specifically directed Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten to ignore the Judiciary Committee's subpoenas citing executive privilege. 
   This is not a situation of exerting executive privilege, because Ms. Miers did not even show up for the hearings that they were called to testify before to assert that claim. Furthermore, Madam Speaker, it is one thing for them to decline to answer certain questions based on a claim of executive privilege; it is an entirely different matter to defy even orders to appear.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1031 provides for the adoption of H. Res. 895, which establishes an Office of Congressional Ethics in the House of Representatives. I rise in support of this important rule that will allow us to enact one of the most important ethics reforms this House has ever seen. 
   Mr. Speaker, the issue of ethics and accountability has long been on the minds of the people that I represent. During my campaign to become a Member of this esteemed body, everywhere I went, people asked about it. They believed and, Mr. Speaker, they were absolutely right, that the corruption and unfair influence that existed in past Congresses was having an effect on our policies, deflecting us from making progress on issues important to them and families across this great Nation. 
   So last year, Mr. Speaker, on my first day in office representing the people of Ohio's 13th District, I was very proud to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives to support the new ethics and lobbying reforms which have now become law. We ended the K Street Project and cut off the gifts and the perks used far too often by lobbyists to woo lawmakers. The historic rules package we passed was extraordinary in its scope and breadth. But it was only the beginning of actions necessary to restore the public trust and to cut off the abuses of recent years. 
   Mr. Speaker, trust is a fragile thing. It's difficult to win and easy to lose. It finds its hold on promises kept and honesty sustained and unquestionable integrity. 
   Many of us, Mr. Speaker, came to this new Congress as new Members dedicated to acting to change the way business was being conducted. In May of last year, I stood side by side with my freshman Democratic colleagues, some of whom we'll hear from today, calling for the creation of a nonpartisan and independent body that could initiate and examine ethics investigations. And today, we are acting to make this change happen. 
   With this bill, we continue the mission of pushing back against corruption. We are forging ahead to restore trust and confidence in this great institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 895 will help end the culture and abuses that have hurt the American people, both in policy and in spirit. This legislation is the culmination of hard work of Representative Capuano and the special task force on ethics enforcement. He deserves our appreciation. 
   Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer also deserve praise for their tireless efforts to move this issue forward, sometimes in contentious times. The independent ethics panel will help cure many of the inherent structural flaws that restrain our present ethics structure by eliminating the conflicts of interest that can be found in our current system. The formation of this office is the next step in our mission to repair the damage to the public trust caused by corruption and to ensure that any potential abuses in the future will be identified and addressed. 
   And it's important to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, that our bill establishes an independent, bipartisan office of congressional ethics. The words ``independent'' and ``bipartisan'' are worth stressing. 
   We may hear today about the desire of some who want to delay action on this important measure, but the American people have waited and waited, and this bill has been a long time in the making. This bill was made necessary by abuses of the past that have robbed the public of their faith and trust in this institution, and this new bill was made possible by the commitment of this new Congress to ensure that we will do what it takes to prevent the excesses and abuses of the past and hold those who violate the rules accountable. 
   Safeguarding the trust of the American people is not a part-time job. The integrity of this institution and the trust of the American people must be paramount. And make no mistake, we take this step not only to restore the public trust, we must take this step to ensure that we will be an institution worthy of that trust. That's why we're acting today. The American people are waiting. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (HONORING FORMER FIRE CHIEF ED HANZEL -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a deep sense of appreciation to pay tribute to former fire chief, Ed Hanzel, who passed away on December 31, 2007 while serving as a combat firefighter in Iraq. 
   Ed, who devoted over 32 years of his life to his community as a firefighter, embarked on two separate tours in Iraq following his retirement in 2002. Retirement did not suit Ed, who felt he could make a positive contribution in Iraq while continuing to provide for his family. 
   And although Denise, his wife of 36 years, worried for his safety, Ed was determined to protect our brave soldiers by utilizing his professional firefighting skills on military bases as a combat firefighter. One morning, at the onset of his second tour, Ed informed a coworker he wasn't feeling well and went to rest. Later that day, Ed Hanzel passed away. 
   Ed was a strong man. He had beaten cancer a few years ago. His death in Iraq surprised his family and friends who knew him for his easygoing nature, his sense of humor, and his ability to light up a room with his bright eyes and genuine smile. After his passing, countless firefighters, emergency medical personnel and other safety forces from 11 neighboring departments joined together to honor Ed's memory. With fire truck ladders extended to form an arch, an American flag was flown at the peak, symbolizing Ed's devotion to his country. 
   A medical helicopter flew low over the crowd, and a fire truck adorned with a black wreath sounded a traditional last call, concluding a ceremony to celebrate a former fire chief, a humble fire chief, who often appeared embarrassed when called ``Chief.'' 
   The respect and admiration Ed earned as a firefighter, a paramedic and a SWAT medic could not have been more visible as his peers joined together around an empty pair of boots and a firefighter's helmet to honor their fallen colleague. 
   We will always remember Ed for his ever-present smile, his commitment to his community, his sense of humor, and his dedication to his family. On behalf of the people of Ohio's 13th District, I want to express my deepest sympathies to his wife, Denise, and son, Brian. We have lost a great man, and they have lost a great husband and father who gave all in service to others and our country. 
   We grieve Ed's passing, but we celebrate his life and service and we take solace in knowing we are better people for having known him.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 602 provides for the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration and considers the conference report as read. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 602 and the underlying conference report on the 21st Century Competitiveness Act. Too often, we hear that our Nation is struggling to properly educate our students in math and science, and as a result we are falling behind in this world. This is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to this Congress. 
   But today we have the chance to change this. Today we make a true commitment to our future. Today we can make it clear that we support American innovation and understand the vital need for our Nation to remain competitive in the global economy. 
   The 21st Century Competitiveness Act will help ensure that our students, teachers, businesses and workers are prepared to continue to keep this country at the forefront of research and development. Our bill increases funding and makes improvements for the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, and at the Department of Energy Office of Science. The bill increases funding for science, technology, engineering and math, also known as STEM research and education programs. 
   This bill also allocates funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. These MEP programs leverage Federal, State, local and private investments to stimulate new manufacturing processes and technologies. It's through these new processes and technologies that we can ensure American manufacturers have the tools to compete effectively and efficiently against overseas manufacturers. 
   The MEP program has proven to be remarkably effective in my home State of Ohio where small and midsize manufacturers face limited budgets, lack of in-house expertise and lack of access to the newest technologies. MEP assistance provided training, expertise and services tailored to the critical needs of Ohio's small and midsize manufacturers. 
   Through this assistance, many manufacturers in Ohio have increased productivity, achieved higher profits, and remain competitive by providing the latest and most efficient technologies, processes and business practices. In 2006, in fact, as a direct result of MEP assistance, my State enjoyed over $150 million of new investment and over $500 million in increased or retained sales. Companies in Ohio participating in the MEP reported cost savings of over $100 million. 
   Through the continued funding of this vital program, we can bring these vast benefits to even more small manufacturers across the country. Our efforts here today are vital to stopping the offshoring and outsourcing as well that may have hurt many communities in my home State of Ohio and all across this Nation. 
   This Congress can send a strong message today that we want to ensure that our Nation is prepared for the future. Let's pass this rule and the 21st Century Competitiveness Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (JOSH MILLER HEARTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the proud sponsor of H.R. 4926, the Josh Miller Helping Everyone Access Responsive Treatment in Schools Act, or the Josh Miller HEARTS Act. 
   This legislation establishes a grant program to ensure that every elementary and secondary school across the country can obtain automated external defibrillators, or AEDs. 
   I introduced the Josh Miller HEARTS Act last December in memory of a young man from my hometown of Barberton, Ohio. 
   Josh was the sort of kid who could light up a room, someone who you knew would go on to achieve great things. He was a sophomore at Barberton High School with a 4.0 grade point average, a linebacker who dreamed of playing football some day for Ohio State. But one day, without warning, those dreams were cut short. 
   During the final game of the 2000 football season, Josh collapsed after leaving the field. By the time his heart was shocked with the defibrillator, it was too late to save him. Josh suffered a sudden cardiac arrest, which according to the American Heart Association, claims the lives of about 330,000 Americans every year. The vast majority of these individuals, like Josh, will never have displayed any signs of heart trouble beforehand. 
   Yet there is an easy-to-use, relatively inexpensive piece of medical equipment that can more than double  the odds of survival for someone experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest. 
   An automated external defibrillator, or AED, is the single most effective treatment for starting the heart after a sudden cardiac arrest. And because the chances of survival decrease up to 10 percent for every minute that passes, every second is critical. 
   Schools, as you've heard, are central gathering places in our communities that make them the ideal locations for AEDs. Placed in our schools, AEDs can save not only students but also staff and parents and many other visitors who come through our schools every day. 
   The Josh Miller HEARTS Act establishes a grant program to ensure that AEDs will be available to every elementary and secondary school, public and private across the country. 
   AED/CPR training is also an important part of raising awareness in using AEDs correctly. H.R. 4926 makes funds for training available to schools that already have AEDs, as well as to schools that will receive AEDs through this program. 
   Finally, this legislation also requires coordination with local emergency medical services and integration into the school's emergency response plan, to ensure their effective use within each community. 
   I would like to take a moment to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for making this legislation a priority and for moving it forward. And I want to thank Representative Kuhl and representatives on both sides of the aisle for their support of this very important initiative. I thank Representative Yarmuth for his leadership, and I also would like to recognize Dr. Terry Gordon, a cardiologist who was instrumental in pushing a similar effort successfully in my home State of Ohio and who has put his whole heart into making this life-saving device available across this Nation his vocation. 
   Finally, I would like to close by thanking the Miller family, especially Josh's parents, Ken and Jerri Miller, for their courage and for transforming their life into this life-saving mission. Losing a young life like Josh's can make us feel helpless, but through these tragedies, many families like the Millers and the Acomporas have found the strength to act. They have found the courage to speak out so that their other children can have the chance that their children never did, and so that other families will not have to feel their pain. 
   Although H.R. 4926 bears Josh Miller's name, it is truly in memory of all those who might have been saved, and in celebration of those who because of this program will have the opportunity to live their lives to their fullest potential. Let's give these children that chance.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3195, ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1299 provides for consideration of H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. The rule makes in order as base text the bill as reported by the Committee on Education and Labor that was identical to the bill as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary. The bill provides for 1 hour of debate, with 40 minutes controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor and 20 minutes by the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Lastly, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1299 and the underlying bill, H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act. It was nearly 18 years ago that the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. It sent a resounding message that discrimination against individuals with disabilities would not be tolerated, not in employment, not in transportation, not in housing, not in services, or in any other area of our daily lives. It was a law intended to tear down the barriers, preventing individuals with disabilities from reaching their full potential. It was a commitment from Congress that discrimination in any form would not be tolerated. 
   The Americans with Disabilities Act was an historic civil rights law, the most sweeping since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yet, despite the broad application of other civil rights statutes, a series of court decisions has dramatically narrowed the scope of the ADA. Unfortunately, this has denied millions of disabled Americans the protections Congress had originally intended for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, the intent of Congress was to allow individuals with disabilities to fully participate in society, free from the fear of discrimination. Yet Supreme Court interpretations have shifted the focus from whether an individual has experienced discrimination to whether an individual could even be considered ``disabled enough'' to qualify for the protections of the law. 
   In making this determination, the Court has implemented a standard that excludes many individuals originally intended to be covered by the ADA. They have held that the definition of ``disability'' must be applied ``strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.'' In addition, the Court has found that mitigating measures that help address an impairment, such as medication, hearing aids or other treatments, must be considered in determining whether an impairment is disabling enough to qualify under the ADA.     
   And so millions of Americans with disabilities have found themselves in a Catch-22. They face employment discrimination because of their disabilities, yet they may be denied relief under the ADA because they are considered ``too functional'' to qualify for its protections. Mr. Speaker, this is completely at odds with the original intent of Congress and the original focus of the ADA. 
   Due to these narrow interpretations, individuals with serious conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and developmental disabilities have found themselves excluded from the protections afforded by the ADA. 
   Basic equality under the law has been denied to millions of disabled Americans for too long. But today, after months of hard work on all sides of this issue, we seek to fulfill the  promise we made to Americans with disabilities nearly two decades ago. 
   And let me be clear. The ADA Amendments Act does not expand the original scope of the ADA. Rather, it restores the promise that Congress made to every single American, a promise that everyone will have an equal opportunity to succeed; that we will tear down the barriers that prevent individuals from reaching their full potential; and that we will be judged on our abilities rather than on our disabilities. 
   The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that the ADA's protections are intended to be broad. It also restores the focus to wrongful discrimination. Our bill clarifies that anyone who is discriminated against because of an impairment, whether or not this impairment limits the performance of any major life activities, is entitled to the ADA protection. 
   And, finally, it states that mitigating measures will not disqualify people with disabilities from the protections afforded by the ADA. 
   I am proud to join with over half of the Members of this body as a cosponsor of this important bill. Today we are demonstrating our commitment to every American that discrimination will not be tolerated. This should be the case whether based on race, national origin, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation or disability. By upholding this most important of principles, our country will be richer for it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Texas is trying to shift the discussion away from this fantastic, fantastic bill, the Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments, onto an issue of energy. But the American people know that for the past 7 years this country under this administration has been following an energy policy from the White House written by the Vice President with the oil executives. 
   Truth be told, there are 68 million acres of leased land available for drilling. And we believe that, of course, that drilling should be taking place on that 68 million acres of leased land, but we also believe that we should be looking diligently for alternative forms of energy. 
   The reality of it is that this is a deflective tactic. This House has passed under this new Congress landmark energy legislation that will provide relief in years to come.     
   We have also passed measure after measure after measure that would provide relief to American consumers but only to have them blocked by those on the other side of the aisle and by the administration. 
   But, today, we don't rise to dwell on that. We rise to support and to celebrate this bill. The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1999 with such a broad coalition of support that it was regarded as a mandate, Mr. Speaker, and we have made progress in a number of areas to ensure individuals with disabilities are fully able to participate in society. But, in many ways, the ADA is a promise that remains unfulfilled. 
   Today, through the ADA Amendments Act, we are unequivocally demonstrating our commitment to the principle of equal opportunity for all Americans. We will be removing the hurdles individuals with disabilities have faced when trying to enjoy the freedoms that are the right of every American. 
   The ADA Amendments Act has the full support of one of the most diverse coalitions of groups I have ever seen, from the disability community, the civil rights community, groups representing pro-business interests, and from Members on both sides of the aisle from this, the people's House. 
   It represents a balance between the interests of employers and individuals with disabilities, and it demonstrates our resolve to ensure that all Americans can work to reach their full potential. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (GREAT LAKES--ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BASIN WATER RESOURCES COMPACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives congressional consent to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. Before I continue, I would like to commend the distinguished chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. JAMES OBERSTAR, who sponsored the House version of this legislation, as well as the senior Senator from Michigan, CARL LEVIN, for their hard work in spearheading this effort. I would also like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman JOHN CONYERS, for his support. 
   Today, Congress considers this legislation pursuant to our duty in article I, section 10, clause 3 of the Constitution, the ``compacts clause,'' to review and approve agreements between States or between States and foreign governments to ensure that they are consistent with the broader national interests. 
   In the case before us, there is no question that the compact designed and agreed to by eight States is in our national interest. The Great Lakes Compact will help to preserve and improve this important natural resource, our Great Lakes, for years to come. The Great Lakes are one of our greatest treasures, an important natural asset that we must never take for granted and that we must always protect. 
   With one-fifth of the world's fresh water, the Great Lakes attracted the early settlers to the legion, and today nearly 33 million people live and work within the basin, spanning eight States: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and my home State of Ohio. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are not only a source of drinking water, but they are also essential for recreation, jobs and the overall health of our economy. Lake Erie alone supports 240,000 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages. The Great Lakes are also highways, moving goods, people and services throughout the region. In addition, the Great Lakes support a multi-billion dollar a year sport fishing and recreational boating industry, and also support travel and tourism throughout the region. 
   However, the Great Lakes are vulnerable to depletion. Each year, rainfall and snowmelt replenish only about 1 percent of the water in the basin. Uncontrolled and careless diversions of water could thus be highly detrimental to the health of the Great Lakes. This compact will bring an end to destructive diversions of water from the basin. 
   The purpose of this compact is to formalize cooperation among the Great Lakes States, to develop and implement regional goals and objectives for water conservation while preserving the States' flexibility regarding their water management programs. 
   New or increased diversions of water from the basin will be banned and community rights will be respected as long as appropriately rigorous standards are met. In addition, every 5 years the regional goals and objectives for water conservation will be reviewed to deal with any new issues that arise. 
   As is routinely the case, Mr. Speaker, Congress expressly reserves the right to alter, amend or repeal this resolution in the future and to strengthen the compact, if necessary. 
   The people of the eight States have worked diligently to craft this compact to preserve this vital resource, and it is urgent that we approve it now to ensure that our Great Lakes are here for future generations. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, our Great Lakes' water is currently, at present, at risk to be carelessly diverted from our basin, and that is why action is so important here today. If we allow that to happen, this water will never return. 
   All eight Great Lakes States have agreed to this compact. I would like to thank Ohio's Governor Ted Strickland for guiding this essential compact through the Ohio State House and Senate. 
   A stretch of Lake Erie shoreline touches my congressional district, and Lake Erie contributes over $9 billion in tourism and travel revenue to our State's economy. In my district we already utilize Lake Erie commercially through Lorain Harbor, and we need this compact to protect our Great Lakes, our water, our source of recreation, our jobs and our economy, and we need this compact now. 
   For the overall health of our Great Lakes and our region, we must pass this compact today to protect our Great Lakes and ensure that future generations will have this great resource. I urge my colleagues to support the Great Lakes compact.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1438 is sponsored by our colleagues from California, Representatives NUNES and COSTA. 
   H. Res. 1438 commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958, and celebrates the extensive contributions of Portuguese-American communities to the United States. 
   From September 27, 1957, until October 24, 1958, a series of violent disruptions and earthquakes destroyed the infrastructure of Faial Island, in Portgual's Azores archipelago, and impacted the other eight islands in the Azores as well. 
   The majority of the Faial Island's 25,000 people lost their livelihoods in the midst of fumes, smoke, lava and constant earthquakes, and had no choice but to escape to other islands in the Azores. 
   The United States, as we so often have in crises of these magnitudes, offered a helping hand to the distressed people of the region through the Azorean Refugee Act. This was spearheaded by Senators John Pastore of Rhode Island and John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
   The Azorean Refugee Act made 1,500 special non-quota immigrant visas available to the destitute victims of the Capelinhos Volcano in the Azores. It was later extended to allow entry of an even greater number of refugees. 
   As a result, more than 175,000 Azoreans came to the United States between 1960 and 1980. The 2000 census placed the total number of Portuguese Americans at 1,176,615. The vast majority of these are of Azorean descent. 
   The communities founded by those immigrants can be found in southeastern New England, the areas around San Francisco, San Diego, and San Joaquin Valley, California, Hawaii, and the New Jersey/New York metropolitan area. 
   In a very short period of time, these immigrants have built on the accomplishments of earlier arrivals. Through their remarkable work ethic, they have distinguished themselves in innumerable fields of endeavor, especially in farming and fishing. By the 1970s, roughly half of all of the dairy farms in the San Joaquin Valley were owned and operated by Portuguese Americans, helping to make California the number one dairy-producing State in the Nation.     
   On the East Coast, Portuguese-Americans have played a prominent role in the fishing industry, and contributed to making New Bedford, Massachusetts one of our Nation's greatest seaports. 
   Portuguese immigrants and their descendants have contributed substantially to this Nation. They are leaders in business, culture and many other professions. They are found in every level of government and in our military, proudly serve the Nation that offered them a helping hand when they needed it most. 
   This Nation has been repaid many times over during the last half century by these immigrants from the Azores and their descendents. Their success story is a demonstration of just what makes our country so great and so strong. By welcoming people with talent and initiative from around the world, we have become a better nation. The Azoreans are a prime example of just how important this has been to the United States over the generations. 
   I am pleased to stand with my colleagues to mark the 50th anniversary of the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958. It is fitting that we honor this group of Americans and recall how well they have repaid our generosity and our openness. It is a lesson for our generation and for future generations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6853, as amended, the Nationwide Mortgage Fraud Task Force Act, was introduced by Congressman Meek from Florida. H.R. 6853 directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation to designate a high-level official to coordinate mortgage fraud investigations. 
   Mortgage fraud is one of the fastest-growing white-collar crimes in the United States. The FBI estimates that the number of cases grew from approximately 17,000 in 2004 to 46,000 in 2007. 
   The losses from these crimes amount to billions of dollars spread among the financial institutions that have been struggling in the wake of the collapse of the real estate market. 
   Beyond the direct harm to the defrauded lender, this crime has far wider ripple effects in our neighborhoods and in our national economy. 
   In our neighborhoods, mortgage fraud has resulted in abandoned houses that cannot be easily resold because they are now owned by a bank and tied up in litigation. These houses often sit empty, deteriorating and becoming overgrown with weeds, an invitation to burglars or other criminal elements, and a blight on the entire neighborhood. In our economy, mortgage fraud has exacerbated the subprime loan crisis that is now having wide-spread effects on the entire financial system. 
   Mortgage fraud can take many forms and may involve dishonest borrowers, appraisers, settlement agents, loan officers, brokers or other persons, including phony straw purchasers under the direction of others. These can be difficult, time consuming and resource-intensive cases to investigate and prosecute. This bill will help the FBI meet these challenges by directing it to appoint a nationwide mortgage fraud coordinator to coordinate the FBI's efforts. 
   The coordinator would supervise regional task forces, coordinate investigations and facilitate appropriate training and information sharing. They would also prepare reports to assist Congress in undertaking any additional legislative response as may be warranted. 
   This is an important bill that addresses an important issue facing our communities and our families. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that each year perhaps as many as 5 million elders are abused, neglected and exploited. And the incidence of elder abuse is likely to only get worse in coming years as 76 million baby boomers reach retirement age. 
   The legal protections against elder abuse vary significantly from State to State, and the National Center on Elder Abuse has estimated that only one in six cases even gets reported. H.R. 5352, the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008, is sponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak). 
   H.R. 5352 will help provide training, technical assistance and other support to State and local law enforcement officials to help them catch and prosecute those who prey on elders. This bill will authorize funding for specialized elder justice police officers and units, as well as for special elder justice positions and units within State and local prosecutors' offices and courts. 
   It will also help provide other services to elders who are victimized. In addition to training for health care, social, and protective service providers, it establishes an Elder Serve Victim Grant Program with regional emergency crisis response teams. These teams will provide short term emergency service to elder victims, including shelter, care, food, clothing, transportation to legal or medical appointments, and other life services as warranted. 
   Finally, it asks the Attorney General and the GAO to examine State and Federal laws and recommend ways to more effectively address this outrageous and growing problem. 
   In addition to Congressman Sestak, I also want to commend the gentleman from Illinois, RAHM EMANUEL, and the gentleman from New York, PETER KING, and the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for their leadership in making this a bipartisan initiative. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend you for your work and leadership on this bill and especially for recognizing the important work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and for providing the Commission with funds above the President's request. 
   Past fiscal irresponsibility on the part of the Republicans means that we've all been working with a tough budget situation this year. But even though we've had to make difficult decisions to get our economy back on the right path, we need also to make room for our most important priorities. I commend you on doing that. 
   Recent articles in The New York Times and USA Today called our attention to some disturbing trends. The number of recalls made by the CPSC reached a record of 467 last year, and 60 percent of those products were produced in China. This year, every single one of the 24 toys that were recalled for safety reasons by the Consumer Product Safety Commission was manufactured in China. Our children have been playing with toys whose hazards range from laceration, to choking, to severe burns. Several toys we've seen were made with lead paint whose hazards are particularly harmful to children. We also have seen them have the direst of consequences with deaths.  
   Imports from foreign countries have been growing at a staggering rate, Mr. Chairman, and many manufacturers from these countries fail to adhere to even basic safety standards. It is in this environment, and I know you know this, Mr. Chairman, that the work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is absolutely critical. Consumer product safety is not an area we can afford to ignore, and the CPSC is not an agency we can afford to underfund. 
   We can't make up for the shortfalls, unfortunately, in funding that the agency has had overnight, but the funding in this year's Financial Services appropriations bill is a positive step in the right direction. I just want to thank you for your leadership on these issues and I look forward to working with you in the future to ensure that oversight agencies like the CPSC have the funds to do the important work that they are called to do.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I am happy to be here today. We are here with some of the other Members of the freshman class, the class of 2006, and I have heard some folks on the other side of the aisle in recent moments talk about the fact that the American people deserve some straight talk. We could not agree more. And that is why we are here today, to talk about some of the things that aren't being talked about quite as loudly on the other side of the aisle. 
   Recently, earlier this week, the administration released its final mid-session review of the budget. The new budget document showed a record deficit for 2009, confirming that in 8 years this administration will have turned the largest surpluses in history into the largest deficits in history. 
   The dismal fiscal record is, unfortunately, just one aspect of this administration's failed economic record. But is that what the administration says to the American people? 
   Now I just want us to take a moment and look at some of the comments that have been coming out, not only from the administration, but from the other side of the aisle in this body. 
   In November of 2007, President George W. Bush, the administration, said, ``Sure, there's some challenges facing us, but the underpinnings of our economy are strong, and we are a resilient economy.'' And then, in December of 2007, he said, ``This economy is pretty good. There's definitely some storm clouds and concerns, but the underpinning is good.'' And that was complemented by the leader of the Republicans here in the House, who said in July of this year, July 21 of 2008, ``While the economy is slow, we are still seeing growth, and frankly, I have got to tell you, I am shocked.'' And then he said way back in October of 2006, Minority Leader Boehner, said as follows, ``Today's announcement by President Bush confirms that the pro-growth economic policies put in place by Republicans are working as planned to spur economic growth and reduce the deficit.'' That was John Boehner, October 11, 2006, Looking forward, trying to suggest that the policies that have been pursued by this administration have benefited the American people. 
   Well, I am really glad that we have this opportunity to have the American people join us this evening to talk about the real facts. And they are not pleasant because it's a sad fact about some of the things that are happening out there. 
   You know, these two, the administration, the President, and Minority Leader Boehner, they are not the only people out there telling the American people that the economy is good. Not so long ago, in the not the distant past, we heard a top economic advisor to Senator McCain tell us that our problems, our economic problems, they are all in our head. In essence, he said that we are suffering from a mental recession. 
   You know, he called our country a Nation of whiners. Well, I have to tell you guys that as a Congresswoman from Ohio in the 13th District, that the people I represent, they are not whiners. They have, unfortunately, too many of them, felt the painful consequences of the failures of the last 8 years of this administration. 
   So I am grateful that you're here tonight to help us describe, and frankly, the important thing is hold accountable this administration for the failures that it is trying to disown. 
   The current administration, you all will know, is going to leave this Nation with the largest deficit in history. I'm sure my colleagues here with me tonight are going to talk about that. And the debt has ballooned as well. The economic growth has been, to give a complimentary spin, has been anemic, and thousands, thousands of jobs have been lost, household incomes have fallen, and the President's fiscal policies have imposed an amazingly heavy debt burden on America's families. 
   You know, I'd like to yield at this time to the distinguished gentleman here tonight, Representative Peter Welch from Vermont, who has been a tremendous agent of change in this body, and I look forward to seeing what this gentleman is going to be able to do, because it's going to be a lot when we have more to work with in the next administration.

How many more families have to fall out of the middle class, lose their jobs, their hopes, their dreams before we change direction. But the good news is the opportunity for change is on the horizon. 
   At this point, I'd like to shift it over to my good friend from Florida, a very distinguished Member of this body, a new Member who came in charging, has already started to deliver change, and I know is raring to deliver more in the next administration, Congressman Ron Klein.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for his remarks and for his forward looking hopefulness. And I think that you are exactly right. Both of the gentlemen have done a great job in laying out sort of where we are, where we have been and where we can go. 
   To that end, we do want the American people to take heart. We look at this chart, and this is an important chart to me because it talks about obviously the job growth that occurred under President Bill Clinton, and it also talks about the disastrous job losses that, unfortunately, we have suffered through this administration. 
   As the gentleman from Connecticut pointed out, we need a government that works. We need a government that works in economic policy and foreign policy and energy policy. We need a government that understands and is responsive to the cries of the people.     
   We have people who are suffering. We have working families who no longer can put food on the table. We're filling up the food pantry lines. We're having to put more money into our food banks because we need to feed more hungry people. The good news is we're feeding more hungry people. The bad news is there are more hungry people and people in poverty in this country. The good news, though, about this chart is that it can change. It can change. We saw the job growth explode under the former administration, the Clinton administration. So there is hope for the future. 
   Part of that, though, is going to revolve around getting a President who understands that the economic policies that we've been operating under need to change. The gentleman from Colorado put it very well when he said we need to get away from the same old, tired policies, the same old, tired path. We have trade policies that are shipping jobs overseas. 
   We heard the gentleman from Wisconsin talking about the beautiful family that is now in dire straits because of the paper company that has closed, the paper mill. Well, do you know what? The paper mills are starting to close, and they're closing in the wake of the steel mills that have closed, and the steel mills have closed because there were unfair tactics being used by the Chinese, for the most part, in dumping steel into this country, and we couldn't compete because you can't always compete with people who are willing to cheat. It wasn't through any fault of our own or through that of the workers who worked so hard and productively in this country, but it worked so well for those who benefited from it in foreign countries with steel that now they do it with paper. It probably won't end with paper, so we need somebody who understands the need to reform, to make the government work, to make sure that when we have trade policies that they don't work against us. They can work with us and with our workers and with our country and with our industries and with our businesses here. 
   The good news is there is hope, but it is important that people know where we begin because change is so necessary. The same old, tired policies, they won't take us where we want to go. They'll take us further down the path where we find ourselves today. 
   Mr. Welch, do you have anything to add at this point?

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman from Colorado, and you put it so well. You put it so well. Our country deserves better, and we need to deliver better with a new president. And Barack Obama has the potential to make that happen, and we are ready, and we want to work in a bipartisan way to help him get us where we need to go, where we know we can go on all of these issues with the economy, with health care. 
   Health care has been a tragedy. The President, the Bush administration started out, the President saying America's children must also have a healthy start in life. And a new term will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs. He said that in September of 2004. 
   But nearly 1 in 9 children does not have health insurance. And the President vetoed the expansion of SCHIP that he called for in 2004. And House Republicans voted to sustain that veto, leaving millions of children without health insurance. 
   We also know that health premiums have increased 78 percent since the administration took office. And the number of Americans covered by private employer-provided insurance has decreased 7 years in a row. It is a competitiveness issue as well for our businesses. Our employers cannot bear this burden and compete 
   effectively. This is a national emergency. 
   But again, the good news is that if we deviate away from the path that has been trod by this administration, the Bush and McCain policies of the past, we can do right by our Nation's children for health care. We can do right by the people out there who are fighting for jobs, who are fighting for access to that which they need for their families, who are just fighting to keep a roof over their heads. And these people are doing things right. They're doing everything right. And yet, this is a country, when you do things right, you ought to be able to make it. And we can do that again. And we can, working with Barack Obama in the White House, it will make all the difference in the world. 
   Mr. Klein, would you like to share with us your thoughts and perhaps wrap up here a little bit?

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time and for her leadership on this very, very important issue. 
   Madam Speaker, today we act to ensure that 11 million children in this Nation will have access to the health care that they need. 
   With this legislation, we add 5 million more of our most vulnerable citizens to the Children's Health Insurance Program. With this legislation, we will finally ensure coverage for 95 percent of all children in need in this great country. 
   Our bill, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection, or CHAMP, Act reauthorizes and improves CHIP, while also making important improvements to the Medicare program and changes that will help reduce tobacco use in this Nation. 
   Children in the State of Ohio stand to benefit tremendously under this bill. The coverage of 218,500 currently enrolled in CHIP will be secured, and funding for the CHAMP Act will allow Ohio to reach another 164,000 children who have remained uninsured until this time. 
   Expanding and improving health care for our children is one of the most important things we can do to ensure a brighter future for our families and our communities and this country. 
   If our children do not have access to the health care they need, it affects their schooling, their home life and can have a severe impact on their ability to grow into a strong, well-rounded adult. 
   Madam Speaker, we hear a lot of purported excuses and lamenting from across the aisle about why we should not act to ensure that the children get the insurance they need here today. 
   Well, I want those Members to go explain to the families and the children in Ohio's 13th Congressional District,  who will now have access to the health care they so vitally need, why they oppose this legislation. These Members need to explain why it's okay that we can provide tax breaks to millionaires but can't afford the less than $3.50 a day it takes to cover a child through CHIP. 
   If we do not pass this bill, children in my district will lose health coverage and families may have to face the consequences of medical debt, and we've seen it all too often lead to bankruptcy and foreclosure. That's unacceptable to me and my constituents. 
   On Medicare, Madam Speaker, the CHAMP Act also makes significant improvements toward improving benefits and limiting premium increases for beneficiaries. More than 202,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Ohio will be assured that their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs will not rise, and almost half a million beneficiaries in my home State with incomes under 150 percent of the poverty level will receive assistance with copayments and deductibles, as well as prescription drug costs. 
   Madam Speaker, I do have some concerns regarding changes in the Medicare policy on the purchase of power wheelchairs and the effect that this will have on Medicare beneficiaries with long-term debilitating conditions. But while I certainly support the overall bill, I hope that we can address this issue in conference or in some other matter in the near future to ensure people are not hurt. 
   I strongly support the rule and the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just described, House Resolution 409 provides for consideration of the conference report for S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 concurrent budget resolution. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   The rule also provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, I said it before and I will say it again: Budgets, more than anything else this government produces are moral documents. For this reason, I am proud to report that this Democratic budget is a victory for our working families and our communities. It is a budget that embodies the highest ideals of our government. 
   The fiscal path set by past Congresses was unsustainable, and it put the economic future of our children and grandchildren at risk. But we are charting a new path, a path that is fiscally responsible and in line with the needs and the priorities of the American people. 
   Our budget reverses years of reckless Republican mismanagement, and restores fiscal responsibility to our government. The $5.6 trillion in surpluses projected at the beginning of the Bush administration have disappeared, and have sadly been replaced by a national debt that was swelled to an estimated $9 trillion. 
   This Democratic budget, in contrast to that reckless spending, reaches balance by 2012 and strictly adheres to the pay-as-you-go principle. And at the same time, it rebalances our priorities to help our communities and those most in need. 
   Our budget increases funding for jobs and education, essential to my home State of Ohio, which has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001. 
   Our budget rejects the President's cuts to vital health care programs such as SCHIP, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, our budget provides for a significant increase in SCHIP funding that, in contrast to the President's proposal, will help cover the 242,000 children in Ohio who remain uninsured. And our budget increases funding for our veterans and our veterans health care programs. These brave men and women who have served our Nation so heroically, deserve only the best services and treatment when they return home.     
   Our budget increases funding for the Community Development Block Grant and the Social Services Block Grant, and it saves the Community Services Block Grant, which the President completely zeroed out. 
   I'm especially proud to have fought for these increases because almost 100,000 people in my congressional district alone have experienced the benefits of the CDBG funding. 
   This budget provides a new direction for our Nation, and let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, no matter what may be said by those on the other side of the aisle, this budget does not call for a single cent in tax increases. Let me repeat, no matter what may be said by those on the other side of the aisle, this budget does not call for a single cent in tax increases. 
   We have also ensured that no additional taxpayers will be ensnared by the Alternative Minimum Tax in 2007 and have provided a reserve fund for a permanent fix. 
   For three of the last 5-years, the Federal Government has had to operate without a budget resolution because the past Congresses failed to pass one, which is why it is critical that we adopt the resolution before us today. It is a budget that reaches balance in 5 years and restores fiscal responsibility through PAYGO rules. We do all this while keeping our priorities in line  with the needs and priorities of the people we have been elected to serve. 
   As a moral document that reflects the priority of our Nation, I believe we have crafted a strong budget, and I'm proud to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my closing remarks by returning us to the painful reality of what we begin with today. 
   This administration and these past Congresses took a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into a $9 trillion debt. This Democratic budget, in contrast, reaches balance by 2012, and strictly adheres to PAYGO rules. 
   This budget contains not a dollar, not a quarter, not a dime, not a penny of tax increases. And you don't just have to take my word for it. The Concord Coalition says that the budget resolution does not have a tax increase. ``Thus to be clear, the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase,'' the Concord Coalition said on March 28. The Center on the Budget and Policy Priorities says the budget resolution does not have a tax increase. ``This claim is incorrect. The House plan does not include a tax increase,'' made on March 28, 2007. The Brookings Institution says, ``The Democratic budget would not raise taxes.'' ``The budget would not raise taxes.'' March 28. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear why passing this rule and passing this budget is so important for our Nation, so let me wrap up this debate by highlighting the facts about our budget. 
   The Democratic budget puts together the broken pieces left to us by the mismanagement of previous Congresses and this administration. Our budget returns fiscal responsibility to Congress, and allocates funding for some of our most important national priorities. Our children, our veterans, and our working families will be provided with the key resources they need and deserve. Our budget protects tax cuts for middle class families, and it does not raise taxes on anyone. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the responsible budget that the American people have been calling for, and it deserves our support. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 350 provides for consideration of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate to be controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Science and Technology. 
   The rule makes in order five amendments printed in the Rules Committee report, each with 10 minutes of debate. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I speak today in support of House Resolution 350 and H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007, a bill which provides essential funding to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the next 3 fiscal years. 
   The United States Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology strives to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness through the advancement of measurement science, standards and technology. Through numerous individual laboratories, the NIST makes important scientific contributions to numerous scientific fields, from building and fire research to computer security to biotechnology. 
   This bill will enhance the important mission, putting the NIST on a path to double its budget by the year 2017. With this additional funding, the NIST will continue to make important contributions to public safety, industrial competitiveness and economic growth. 
   This bill also allocates funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, also known as MEP. These MEP programs leverage Federal, State, local and private investments to stimulate new manufacturing processes and technologies. These new processes and technologies are a key component for ensuring that American manufacturers have the tools to compete effectively and efficiently against overseas manufacturers. 
   The MEP program has proven remarkably effective in my home State of Ohio, where small and midsize manufacturers face limited budgets, in-house expertise and access to the newest technologies. MEP assistance providing training, expertise and services tailored to the critical needs of Ohio's small and midsize manufacturers have made a big difference. Through this assistance, manufacturers in Ohio have increased productivity, achieved higher profits and remained competitive by providing the latest and most efficient technologies, processes and business practices. 
   In 2006, as a direct result of MEP assistance, my State enjoyed over $150 million of new investment and over $500 million in increased or retained sales. Companies in Ohio participating in the MEP reported cost savings of over $100 million. Through the continued funding of this vital program, we can bring these vast benefits to even more small manufacturers across the country. 
   Finally, and very importantly, this bill allocates funding for the new Technology Innovation Program, which funds high-risk, high-reward, precompetitive technology development by small and medium-sized companies. The goal of this program is to accelerate the development of technologies that will have a broad economic impact on our technology market. 
   Harvard Professor Daniel Bell once said that ``Technology, like art, is a soaring exercise of human imagination.'' It is through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Technology Innovation Program that technology is given the wind that it needs to soar. Even more importantly, through this bill, small and midsize manufacturers will be given the support they need to compete with larger competitors in overseas businesses. 
   This bill will not only provide assistance to American companies, like the 1,773 companies in Ohio that were helped by the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, but it will also create a stronger and more vibrant American technology industry. This is a good bill, and it deserves our support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, it is time we put some teeth behind our rhetoric about helping our manufacturers and promoting innovation and industrial competitiveness. While there are many things that must be done on many different fronts to see real improvements, passing the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act today is one very positive action we can take for manufacturers in Ohio and across the Nation. 
   It also tells those involved in measurement science, standards and technology, and those working to contribute to public safety, industrial competitiveness and economic growth that we are behind their efforts. 
   As I said earlier, when we support the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and the Technology Innovation Program, we are not only talking the talk, we are walking the walk. For this reason, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. 
   Head Start is vital for our children in high-need areas, providing them with programming critical to their cognitive development, from math and reading instruction, to nutritional and social services for students' families. 
   In 2006, over 900,000 children, almost all of them under 5 years old, participated in Head Start. 
   In my home State of Ohio, Head Start serves more than 38,000 young people, including more than 2,500 children in my congressional district alone. These children come from some of the most high-need families in our Nation, and Head Start does exactly what its name suggests. It gives these children a head start, helping them achieve at or above their age level by the time they leave the program. 
   Unfortunately, children in families facing difficult economic situations often begin school behind their wealthier peers. Head Start achieves amazing results for these children and is often the only program keeping them from falling behind. 
   Despite the crucial role Head Start plays in the lives of hundreds of thousands of American children, Congress has neglected them has neglected to reauthorize or adequately fund this program for the past 4 years. 
   This important legislation authorizes funding for Head Start through fiscal year 2012 and makes a number of long overdue improvements to the program. 
   Our bill increases funding for teacher and staff salaries and benefits and will improve the classroom environment by lowering the student-to-teacher ratio. These changes will give our hardworking teachers and other educational staff more opportunity to work with their students and improve their academic performance. 
   This legislation also helps program hire and retain qualified teachers and staff by increasing salary and benefits and supporting professional development plans. And this bill will expand access to 10,000 additional children. 
   This Congress is making a commitment to our children and the Head Start program, and it is critical that we do so. Research has shown that children attending Head Start are more likely to graduate from high school than other low-income children. Research has also proven that children who attend Head Start are less likely to enter special education, are less likely to repeat a grade and are less likely to end up in the criminal courts in adolescence. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will give more of our children the help and assistance they need. With passage of  this legislation, we are not only providing our children with the opportunity for a brighter future, we are building a brighter future for our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill so we can keep our promise to America's children.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding me the time. 
   And I, too, rise today with heaviness in my heart but also with a deep sense of gratitude and respect for my colleague, my friend, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Her passing is truly a tragic loss for the people of Ohio's 11th District, whom she loved so very much, and for all of the people who she stood up for across this country. 
   Stephanie was truly an historic figure in American politics. She achieved  many firsts and she blazed many trails in a way that only Stephanie could. She was the first African American and first female prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio; the first African American woman to sit on the Common Pleas bench in Ohio; the first African American woman to be elected to Congress from Ohio, and the first African American woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee, a job she truly loved. 
   Stephanie attacked her job as a Congresswoman with passion and a contagious enthusiasm on behalf of those she served. She was effective and determined. Her strength exceeded courage. She was fearless. She lived her life and represented her constituents giving it everything she had. She had no time for fear. 
   Her amazing spirit touched and brightened so many lives, and with every first that Stephanie achieved, with every rung of the ladder she climbed, Stephanie always reached back to help others following behind. From encouraging the young women and men in her office who interned, to inspiring the young people from her hometown of Cleveland, Stephanie was a force. And she loved her staff and spoke of them as family. Stephanie was not pretentious. She treated all people as they should be treated, with dignity and respect. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I first arrived in these hallowed Halls in January of 2007, I was very fortunate to have Stephanie here to help me. She was a colleague and a friend who I could turn to for advice not only on the many crucial issues that we face but also simply on how to navigate this body. And when I thanked her for helping me along, she would always wave a hand in the air and explain, ``Hey, we're sisters.'' Stephanie's friendship and mentorship were vital to me, and I am grateful that she touched my life 
   Stephanie was honest and loyal. You could count on her word. She was the type of person who could lift up the spirits of those feeling down. She was willing to work with others for the good that was greater than just herself, but she was also tough and willing to fight as necessary to protect the rights of the people of this great country. Nowhere was this more evident than in the fight she led to ensure the integrity of our voting process. Stephanie also worked tirelessly to promote home ownership and to help keep families in their homes. 
   But with all of her achievements, nothing compared to that of the strong young man that Stephanie raised, her son, Mervyn. Stephanie's face would beam when she talked about Mervyn. There could be no question beyond everything she gave in service, everything she accomplished, they all paled in comparison to how proud she was of Mervyn. She loved him and continues to love him beyond measure. 
   Stephanie also had a beautiful and strong sister who she loved and appreciated so deeply. When Stephanie spoke of her sister Barbara, it was clear how special Barbara was to her. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on about the life of this amazing woman. I am so honored to have known her and to have served alongside of her. Stephanie was more than my colleague; she was my friend, and we were sisters. I will miss her greatly. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with her son Mervyn, and her very special sister Barbara, and the rest of her family.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 928, IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 701 provides for consideration of H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in  order the Oversight and Government Reform Committee reported substitute. The rule makes in order all five germane amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the rule and in favor of H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act. I am very proud to be a Member of this new Congress because over the last 9 months we have made huge strides to better our great country. 
   We have empowered our workers. We have fought to lift up our citizens. And today, I am proud to join my colleagues once again as we press for greater government accountability and work to restore the trust of the American people in this great institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today will amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to ensure necessary government oversight and strengthen the role of the Inspectors General. 
   Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the Inspector General Act. Offices of Inspector General now exist in more than 60 Federal Departments and agencies where they work to combat waste, fraud and abuse. 
   The Inspectors General have many vital tasks. They act as government watchdogs, conducting audits and examining complaints from agency employees. They actively promote efficiency in government programs, and encourage employee disclosure of waste and fraud. 
   Our bill today acts to strengthen and clarify their tenure, resources, authority, oversight and autonomy. It is an important action that we are taking today. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, in recent years, politics has crept into the inner workings of the Inspectors General leaving the door open for political pressure and influence to prejudice the job that they are supposed to perform. 
   Under President Bush, only 18 percent of the Inspectors General have audit experience while 64 percent have political experience. This is in comparison to President Clinton who appointed far more, 66 percent, of Inspectors General with audit experience versus only 22 percent with political experience. 
   And what's more, over one-half of the IGs appointed by President Bush had made contributions to his campaign or to other Republican candidates and over one-third had worked in a Republican White House prior to their appointment; whereas none of the IGs appointed by President Clinton had worked in a Democratic White House. 
   These statistics are concerning because the hallmark of Inspectors General must be their independence from the departments and agencies within which they are housed. This independence is crucial because the inspectors are charged with submitting reports to the agency heads and to Congress regarding any failures on the part of their agencies. 
   When this independence is compromised, the missions and goals of the Inspectors General lose credibility. Their work is critical to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are being used wisely and that our government is working efficiently and effectively. 
   The Improving Government Accountability Act will strengthen the independence of these important watchdogs. First, it clarifies when the inspectors can be removed from their posts. Under current law, they have limited protection from removal from office. In fact, inspectors that are appointed by the President can be removed by the President without cause. The only requirement is that the President must report the removal to Congress after the removal has already been accomplished. It is much more difficult to be independent when you know that the head of the Department that you are critically evaluating can remove you and that there are no checks on that power. 
   Our bill specifies that they may only be removed before the end of their term for permanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance or conviction of a felony, or conduct involving moral turpitude. This takes the politics out of a position and a decision-making process where it never should have been in the first place. 
   Under this new law, removal of an Inspector General must be communicated to both Houses of Congress at least 30 days before that inspector's removal. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today encourages inspectors to remain in office for at least 7 years by setting a fixed term of office and allowing the inspectors to be renewed at the completion of their term. This allows for greater continuity and increased independence on the part of the inspectors. 
   Under this legislation, an Inspector General will be allowed to submit budget requests directly to the Office of Management and Budget. This is a vital change. Inspectors General must not be at the mercy of administration officials who have the unbridled power to cut their budget because of disagreement over their findings or improper political influence. Budget autonomy is crucial to the independence of these inspectors. 
   Further, H.R. 928 establishes the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. This council's task will be to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of the Inspectors General staff. The council will seek out fraud, waste and abuse in Federal programs. 
   Today, through the Improving Government Accountability Act, we will give the Inspectors General more power to do their job and, more importantly, to do so with heightened independence and integrity. 
   The trust of the American people is a precious thing. The bill today guarantees that our departments and agencies are worthy of that trust. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, in 1978, the House committee that was then known as Government Operations envisioned Inspectors General as watchdogs to bring accountability and oversight to our agencies. Now, almost 30 years later, we act to update and improve this valuable program. 
   This important bill will not only bring enhanced continuity and accountability to the Inspectors General; it will strengthen their most important quality: their independence from the Departments and agencies that they inspect. 
   The American people should have the utmost faith that their precious taxpayer dollars are being used in the most efficient manner. This bill ensures the accountability that our citizens demand and which they deserve. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2740, MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. H. Res. 702 provides for consideration of H.R. 2740, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act Expansion and Enforcement Act of 2007, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for three amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill which helps to address one of the most disturbing and pressing issues to come before the Congress this year, the lack of oversight and accountability of contractors abroad and here at home. And it is vital that we are passing the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act today to address at least one of these critical issues. 
   Currently, there are estimated to be at least 180,000 contractors working in Iraq under contracts awarded by the Department of Defense, the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other Federal agencies. Yet under current law, only contractors working for the Department of Defense can be held responsible for crimes they commit while working in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere throughout the world. 
   At present, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, MEJA, leaves felonies committed by contractors working for other Federal Departments unpunished. This is unfair and unacceptable, and this Congress must act to ensure that justice is not a selective American principle. 
   Our current law has given private mercenary armies like Blackwater USA free rein to do as they please without fearing the repercussions. And as we have seen, that unbridled freedom from any accountability has resulted in sometimes egregious criminal behavior. But under the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act, Federal contractors working for every Department and agency will be held responsible for criminal acts. It will also direct the FBI to establish units to investigate crimes committed by contract personnel operating abroad. 
   Mr. Speaker, it simply makes no sense to hold contractors to a different standard than American citizens living at home or even the brave soldiers who risk their lives every day in Iraq. It is a travesty of justice that we allow private armies to evade punishment for serious crimes, especially considering we have prosecuted our soldiers for the very similar actions.     
   In a recent incident that has received significant scrutiny, Blackwater guards were involved in a September 16 shootout in Baghdad that left 11 Iraqis dead and a number wounded. This event spurred such a tremendous public outcry that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had to apologize to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki. 
   And we have learned from reports compiled by Blackwater themselves that since 2005, its employees have been involved in at least 195 incidents in Iraq that involved the firing of shots by Blackwater guards. Blackwater's contract with the State Department stipulates that Blackwater may only engage in defensive use of force. However, in the vast majority, over 80 percent, of these shooting incidents, Blackwater's own reports revealed that its guards fired the first shots. In one incident that has recently come to our attention, Blackwater guards shot a civilian bystander in the head. In another, State Department officials report that Blackwater sought to cover up a shooting that killed a seemingly innocent bystander. 
   Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, and despite numerous instances where the military has found probable cause that a crime has been committed and has referred the case to the Justice Department, there has been only one successful prosecution of a civilian contractor for wrongdoing. 
   Without fear of reprisal, these reckless contractors have operated with no regard for the private property of innocent Iraqi citizens. In a November 2005 incident, a Blackwater motorcade collided with 18 different vehicles. Written statements from team members were determined to be invalid, and a Blackwater contractor on the mission stated his tactical commander ``openly admitted giving clear direction to the primary driver to conduct these acts of random negligence for no apparent reason.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we have seen the number of contractors increase exponentially as the Bush administration has placed an unnecessary strain on our Armed Forces through the war in Iraq. In 2001, Blackwater had less than $1 million in Federal contracts. By 2006, that figure had grown to over half a billion dollars, an increase of more than 80,000 percent. Today, there are approximately 180,000 Federal contractors in Iraq alone, a number greater than the American military presence. Because of the President's policy of escalation in Iraq, we have become more reliant on these contractors to protect American interests there. For every Blackwater mercenary the United States Government hires to protect embassy officials, Blackwater charges $1,222 per day, which is over six times more than the cost of an equivalent American soldier. 
   Mr. Speaker, the lack of oversight of Federal contractors committing crimes overseas is an example of how the system of Federal contracting is broken. Earlier this year, this Congress got off to a strong start by passing H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act which helped restore integrity to the contracting process. I am also proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 2198, the Contractor Accountability Act, which will require the head of every agency and department to ensure that every Federal contract recipient is fulfilling their obligations after they are awarded that contract. It requires that every Federal agency and department awarding contracts submit a report on the status of those contracts to Congress. This is the type of oversight and accountability that is necessary to ensure that the problems that are happening in Iraq with Federal contractors and here at home can finally be put to an end. 
   Today, with the passage of the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act, we are addressing a critical loophole in our contracting crisis by ensuring that those contractors who commit crimes are held accountable for their actions. What we seek to do today is simple but important. The MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act will hold Federal contractors operating overseas to the same standards we hold ourselves and to which we hold our brave troops. And let's be clear. This bill does not prevent contractors from using force if the situation calls for it. Our bill simply allows contractors to be punished for committing acts of murder and other felonies. Nobody should be immune from the law. This legislation will ensure that no one, even if he is a private contractor in Iraq, is. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina on this strong bipartisan bill. The MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act is critical, commonsense legislation to hold contractors responsible for criminal behavior, just like we hold our troops responsible for crimes when they are committed, and just like we hold American citizens responsible for following the law. 
   Those who argue against this measure seem willing to tolerate lawlessness in countries where our military is seeking to restore justice. The truth is, every time we see an incident with an Iraqi civilian being killed and American contractors escaping accountability, our men and women in uniform suffer. They see support from the insurgents rise and they lose the trust of the Iraqi people. 
   Our troops are not responsible for the strain that the President has placed on our Armed Forces which has led to the need for mercenaries to carry out missions that our troops capably handle, and it is tragic that the troops are targeted for the negligence of private contractors. We owe it to our troops and the Iraqi people to ensure that contractors are held to the same standards of justice as everybody else. Only then will we see a true deterrent to vigilante behavior and reckless actions by private citizens working overseas for our Federal agencies and Departments. 
   It is simple, Mr. Speaker. The MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act extends policies that are in place for the  Department of Defense to contractors for other agencies. 
   And let's be clear: Nobody is accusing every single contractor of committing the criminal acts we have talked about today. But when a contractor does commit a crime, they must be punished and we must have consequences to serve as a deterrent. It should not be controversial to punish people for committing murder and other felonies. This is a giant loophole in our law that is hurting our reputation abroad, hurting our troops in the field and is making a mockery of the American sense of justice. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1338, PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee for her leadership on this issue and for the time. I also want to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and Representative Rosa DeLauro for their commitment and dedication to bringing this forward over hurdle past hurdle past challenge past challenge. Thank you so much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1388 and the underlying legislation, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Mr. Speaker, fairness is something we strive for in all aspects of our lives. From an early age, we try to instill in our children the importance of fairness, fair play, and equality. But, sadly, while we preach fairness, on average, women today earn a deplorable 77 percent of what men earn and, unfortunately, the wage gap in my home State of Ohio is even more substantial than the national average. 
   According to the National Women's Law Center, Ohio ranked 30th in the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings. The Center gave Ohio, along with 46 other States, a failing grade. That is simply unacceptable. 
   I have read and heard the stories of wage discrimination. We have all heard the story of Lilly Ledbetter, the worker who was a victim of systematic pay discrimination for 19 years. These are the stories of women who have dedicated decades upon decades of their lives to their employers, only to find out that they are compensated at a fraction of the rate of their male counterparts. 
   With every paycheck these women deposit, they and their families are being held back, their earning potential limited by a factor over which they have no control, their gender, and a factor that has no affect on their job performance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to read to you a letter my office received on this issue from a college student at the University of Akron. She wrote, ``Ever since I started working, I have become more knowledgeable of the fact that in most cases men receive a higher pay than women do for the same amount of work.'' 
   We need to send a message to the young women in our country that the status quo is not acceptable. We need to respond to the concerns of our future leaders and show them that we are willing to stand up for their right to earn equal pay for equal work. 
   This young woman went on to say, ``Equal pay for equal work is a simple matter of justice for women.'' I couldn't say it better myself. The Paycheck Fairness Act will update and  strengthen the Equal Pay Act. This bill will close numerous loopholes in the 45-year old law that has allowed employers to avoid liability for discriminatory practices.     
   The American people expect their government to stand up for fairness and justice. The Paycheck Fairness Act is not only about changing the way we treat our working women. It is about paying rent, putting food on the table, and paying for college tuition. We must return to the founding principles of our Nation and what has moved us forward in difficult times. Fairness has been at the heart of all that makes America strong, and this Congress cannot turn away from that. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and this incredibly important bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on this issue. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 1389 and the underlying bill, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   Our Nation is blessed to have the finest system of higher education in the world, and I am proud that my district is the home of the University of Akron and the Lorain County Community College. UA boasts one of the top science and engineering programs in the Nation, and Lorain County Community College is a leader in education and entrepreneurial and economic development across northeast Ohio. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Higher Education Act was first signed into law in 1965 to help students from low income families afford a college education. Unfortunately, in the 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last reauthorized, the dream of a college degree has moved further out of reach for far too many of our Nation's students. 
   Overall, the United States is third out of 30 industrialized nations in postsecondary degree attainment, but only ninth out of 30 when looking at younger workers. This is an ominous trend that we must act swiftly to address. 
   With the cost of tuition and textbooks skyrocketing, we have taken action to make college for affordable. Last year we passed legislation that increased college financial aid by $18 billion and cut student interest loan rates. 
   With this bill today, we are raising the bar even higher in fighting for access to higher education by increasing the maximum Pell Grant level from $5,800 per year to $8,000 by 2014. 
   This bill also provides for improved teacher training and development programs. It provides loan forgiveness for students who choose public sector careers, and creates a new scholarship program for active duty military personnel and their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, from coast to coast, and throughout the heartland, this great Nation is filled with bright and enthusiastic students seeking to take advantage of any opportunity we can give them for a more prosperous future. This bill makes critical investments in our students to strengthen our workforce for the future of our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   I thank Chairman Miller for his diligent work in making this happen.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1362, ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, and I thank her for her leadership on this rule and to get this bill to the floor so we can begin the big task of restoring accountability and oversight in our Federal contracting system. 
   I rise in support of the rule today and in support of H.R. 1362. I strongly believe we must restore the American people's faith in our government, and that is what this bill is about. 
   This bill will help stop the abuses of the Federal contracting system, a system that has deservedly come under fire recently, and sadly, whether it is in Iraq, Walter Reed, or many other places. 
   H.R. 1362 will increase transparency and accountability to help bring back the integrity to a system that has lost so much of the public's trust, and it is no wonder that we have lost so much of the public's trust when we have government auditors testifying that an estimated $10 billion in reconstruction spending has been wasted as a result of overcharging, poor tracking, and mismanagement by U.S. contractors. But this is not only an issue about waste, abuse and fraud, it is about getting the job done right and ensuring we have the proper people in place to help those who need Federal Government services. 
   Recent hearings brought to light an Army memorandum showing that the decision to privatize support services at Walter Reed was causing an exodus of ``highly skilled and experienced personnel.'' And as a result, the ``patient care mission are at a risk of mission failure,'' the memorandum continued. 
   So not only do we need to end the waste and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used wisely, we need greater oversight and accountability on the contracting decisions that are being made in the first place. And we need to tell these contractors that if they are going to get a contract with the Federal Government, they must play by the rules and they must fulfill their responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. 
   Passing H.R. 1362 and the other bills that have been on the House floor this week are important steps in our effort to restore the faith in government that has been lost by the American people. I understand that additional legislation regarding contractor oversight and accountability is in the pipeline,  and I look forward to working with this new Congress and chairmen of the committees of jurisdiction on this most important issue.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5719, TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1102 provides for consideration of H.R. 5719, the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008, under a closed rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate on the bill controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, April 15, is Tax Day, which has long been a source of stress and anxiety for many working families. However, today we will bring good news. We will consider legislation that will alleviate many of the tax-related difficulties Americans face today and throughout the year. This legislation will streamline the tax filing process for individuals and businesses as well as improve IRS customer service and strengthen privacy protections. 
   The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act is also fully paid for by ensuring funds from tax-advantaged health savings accounts will be used for qualified health care expenses, and by temporarily delaying a withholding requirement on government payments to contractors. 
   It also contains provisions to strengthen the integrity of the Tax Code, making it simpler and fairer for all Americans. It eliminates incentives for U.S. companies to outsource work by ensuring they cannot escape paying employment taxes on government workers. 
   In addition, this legislation will also prevent thousands of elderly and disabled individuals from owing employment taxes for in-home care workers provided through State and local government programs. 
   This legislation also improves IRS service and outreach to low-income taxpayers in several ways. First, it allows IRS employees to refer taxpayers requiring assistance with tax cases to qualified low-income taxpayer clinics. It also requires that the IRS notify taxpayers of their potential eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which has been the largest need-based, anti-poverty program in the United States, lifting millions of Americans out of poverty every single year. 
   GAO estimates that in 2004, Americans failed to claim $8 billion in earned income tax credits, hundreds of millions of dollars in my home State of Ohio alone. These credits have the potential to help strengthen families and their financial security while also benefiting our communities at large by stimulating local economic development and job growth. And in order to ensure that eligible families can continue to take advantage of the earned income tax credit, this legislation authorizes an annual $10 million grant to Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, or VITA, programs. VITA provides free assistance to qualified low-income taxpayers, thanks to these grants as well as the assistance of dedicated volunteers across the country. 
   The availability of these valuable services makes it unnecessary for working families to turn to high-cost tax preparers and unscrupulous organizations engaging in predatory practices like offering what is called ``Refund Anticipation Loans.'' 
   The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act also includes several  provisions to strengthen privacy protections and government accountability. Importantly, it prohibits the IRS from providing individual taxpayer information to private entities employing predatory loan tactics. And it requires the IRS to notify taxpayers of suspected identity theft and fraud. It also takes the important step of repealing the authority of the IRS to contract with private debt collection agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no duty more central to the functioning of the Federal Government than the collection of its revenue. But under the Bush Administration, this inherently governmental responsibility has been farmed out to private collectors who keep up to 25 percent of the tax revenues they collect. The program has caused confusion and aggravation for many taxpayers because these private debt collectors frequently demand sensitive personal information without revealing the nature of their phone calls, as was documented in a Ways and Means Committee hearing last year. 
   In addition, the operations of private contractors are not held to the same standard of transparency as required of the Federal Government. There is the danger that sensitive personal information could be compromised through careless handling of these cases without accountability. The Taxpayer Advocate Service has reported over 1,500 complaints related to this program. And not only are there serious privacy and service issues, but the promised cost savings of the private debt collection program has simply not materialized. One needs to look no further than a headline on the front page of today's Washington Post that proclaims, ``Collectors Cost IRS More Than They Raise.'' 
   Private debt collectors are also less efficient than the IRS. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service points out, the Department of the Treasury estimates that private collection agencies collect $4 for every dollar it invests in tax collection efforts, but every dollar invested in IRS collections yields five times that amount. 
   The downside of continuing to outsource the duties of the Internal Revenue Service clearly outweigh any benefits. It's just another disturbing example of a poor governmental function being outsourced to private contractors with subpar results and a lack of transparency and accountability. It is a waste of taxpayer resources, and it is about time that we eliminated the IRS's authority to outsource this government responsibility. 
   The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act improves government accountability and makes the Tax Code simpler and fairer for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, before I yield, I'd just like to clarify for the record some of the things that have been presented. 
   The National Taxpayer Advocate, who is appointed by the Treasury Secretary, reported to Congress that ``the money spent on the IRS Private Debt Collection initiative is an inefficient use of government dollars.'' The Chief of the National Taxpayer Advocate Service testified that the IRS employees bring in $20 for every dollar IRS spends, whereas private debt collectors bring in only $4. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008 is a strong pro-taxpayer bill that adopts legislative recommendations and tackles many of the most serious problems detailed in the National Taxpayer Advocate's Report to Congress. 
   In this weakening economy, America's working families will face many challenges in the months ahead and we in Congress need to do what we can to help. This legislation will streamline the tax filing process and ease the burden of tax law compliance, it will ensure that we are good stewards of taxpayer funds by eliminating unnecessary and wasteful programs that compromise the integrity of our governmental functions, and it makes the Tax Code simpler and fairer by eliminating unduly burdensome compliance requirements and providing commonsense solutions. 
   I am proud, Mr. Speaker, to support this legislation, because it makes the needs of working Americans a priority.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, on October 13, Ohio Attorney General Mark Dann, U.S. Attorney Gregory Lockhart, and USDA Agent Mark Barnhart received the 2007 Humane Law Enforcement Award from the Humane Society and the National District Attorneys Association. They were honored with this prestigious award for conducting one of the largest, best coordinated crackdowns on dog fighting in the Nation. 
   I am extremely proud that my home State of Ohio is taking a lead in cracking down on this vicious blood sport, but this raid also demonstrates the difficulty authorities have of prosecuting offenders under Federal law. 
   I have introduced the Dog Fighting Prohibition Act, which would strengthen Federal penalties for those participating in dog fighting and broaden the scope of the law to allow prosecution of everyone involved, from spectators to trainers to dealers. We need to do all we can to end what has become a lucrative gambling business; and to accomplish that, we must give our law enforcement officials like Mark Dann, Gregory Lockhart, and Mark Barnhart the tools that they need. I want to thank them and congratulate them on their efforts, and encourage support for the Dog Fighting Prohibition Act.

   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1727, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Quality of Life for Persons with Paralysis Act. And as I express my support for this legislation today, I would like to recognize an outstanding organization in my district, Linking Employment, Abilities, and Potential, or LEAP. 
   LEAP provides hope and empowerment for tens of thousands of people with disabilities and their families throughout Northeast Ohio.  
   Through legislation such as the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, Congress sends a message about people with disabilities--that they matter, that they can and do make valuable contributions to society. That is a message that LEAP and so many disability rights advocates send every day. 
   LEAP is deeply committed to empowering people with disabilities in the workplace through specialized skill development programs, at home through independent living training, in the medical system through access to the best medical care, and in so many other aspects of society. LEAP's Disability Employment Training Program, in particular, aligns with the goals of Christopher and Dana Reeve, who fought so hard for integration and acceptance for those with disabilities in our communities. LEAP has an 80 percent success rate in employment training and placement and has a tremendous impact on the community, recognizing the many talents of people with disabilities and the potential to be productive citizens. 
   Once again, I rise to express my support for H.R. 1727, and to honor Linking Employment, Abilities, and Potential.

   Today is a great day, and I rise in support of the rule and the underlying resolution in this matter to improve our security on our rail and busway systems throughout this country.     
   When I was running for this office, this was a very, very important and significant issue to many people who I represent throughout Northeast Ohio. We have many passengers and others who utilize these services who, unfortunately, despite evidence of vulnerability and potential attack, have been exposed to the ongoing danger of our failure to secure these systems. I also am proud to see that in this bill we have protections for whistleblowers that will improve the likelihood of secure and safe transit systems within our country.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, first of all I would like to commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee for his extraordinary leadership and hard work on this legislation. I also want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Bachus, along with Mr. Frank for their extraordinary hard work. I also extend my thanks to Mr. Miller, the sponsor of this bill, as well. 
   Today I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 3915 that I believe will take an important step in preventing avoidable foreclosures. The news stories we see every day remind us that this subprime mortgage crisis is not going away immediately. In fact, it is getting worse.  
   RealtyTrac just released its third quarter foreclosure numbers, and the numbers are staggering. Foreclosure filings increased 30 percent nationally from the second quarter, which translates to one foreclosure filing for every 196 American households. 
   Two of the largest metro areas in my district are among the 15 with the highest foreclosure rates nationally. Foreclosures in the Cleveland, Lorain, Elyria area are up 179 percent from last year. One in every 57 homes in that area is in foreclosure. In Akron, it is one of every 76. These are families in my district who are suffering. 
   Many of the loans involved in the current subprime mortgage crisis are hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. Though these loans typically begin with a low fixed ``teaser'' rate, it resets after 2 or 3 years, often to as much as two or three times the original payment. 
   According to a recently conducted survey, one in four homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages were not aware how soon their rates could spike, and three-quarters did not know how much their payments might increase. 
   A homeowner who does not know what is coming may not be able to ask for help until it is too late. The amendment I am offering today would take a simple step to help ensure homeowners have the opportunity to pursue all of the options available to them before the foreclosure becomes inevitable. 
   My amendment, which is based on a recommendation of the Ohio Foreclosure Prevention Task Force, will require lenders to send a notice to homeowners holding hybrid adjustable rate mortgages 6 months before their interest rates are due to reset. The notice will contain four key pieces of information: 
   It will include the new interest rate and an explanation of how it will be determined; 
   Second, it will require the lender to include a good-faith estimate of the monthly payment that will apply after the loan resets; 
   Third, it contains a list of alternatives the consumer may pursue before the date of the adjustment or reset if they feel they will have difficulty in meeting the payment obligations; 
   Finally, it will include the contact information of the local HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, as well as the State housing finance authority for the State in which the consumer resides. 
   Enhanced disclosures will help prevent avoidable foreclosures and ensure our families are not caught by surprise and trapped in a position that may ultimately force them out of their homes. I believe this disclosure is a vital tool for our families, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, requiring lenders and servicers to include their best estimate of the amount that will be incurred when the loan resets is a commonsense way to deal with providing these borrowers with information that is essential if they are in a position to avoid foreclosure, and all we are asking under this amendment is for a good-faith estimate based on accepted industry standards. 
   The estimate need not be exact. A lender or servicer simply needs to make a good-faith effort to estimate the payment that will apply after reset. 
   It is important to keep consumers informed about the date of reset, but if they are not sure what they will face when the loan resets, it will be much more difficult for them to prepare what is coming. This is a simple requirement to insure that not only will homeowners know when this will happen, but also what will happen. 
   I appreciate greatly the remarks of the ranking member, Mr. Bachus, and of course the support of the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 637 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration and considers the conference report as read. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in support of this rule and this much-needed underlying conference report, the College Cost Reduction Act, which will help give our students a real opportunity to go to college and give them the vital tools necessary to enter our workforce and build a positive future for themselves and our communities. And, Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to thank Representative George Miller, the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, along with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, whose commitment to our students, our families and our future in this country has brought us to this day when we are able to take this great step to put college education back within reach of so many hardworking families and students. The College Cost Reduction Act addresses one of the most pressing issues facing millions of families across this Nation: the question of how they will afford to send their children to college. 
   Educational opportunity is the backbone of our Nation and everything that makes it great. And while access to higher education is more critical than ever for younger generations, the cost is rapidly moving out of reach for many low- and middle-income families. Tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities has risen 41 percent after inflation since 2001. And the typical American student now graduates from college with a $17,500 debt. This problem has developed into nothing less than a crisis. 
   Sadly, due to the failure of past Congresses, many students have had their dreams shattered because they could not afford college tuition. Many hardworking parents have had their hearts broken because, despite their valiant efforts, they simply could not afford to pay tuition and meet other vital family needs. This problem has festered for too long, and I have long believed, Mr. Speaker, that those in government must work with the people they are called to serve and not against them. 
   And that is what this bill does. It is the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill. It's good for our families. It's good for our students. It's good for our country. 
   Financial barriers to higher education not only hurt students themselves by robbing them of the education and training necessary to make a productive and positive impact in our communities; it hurts us all. Investing in our students will not only improve their future; it will help our economy and our retired workers whom they will support. It ensures our national security, continued improvements in health outcomes, and will help the United States maintain its role as a leader in developing new cutting-edge technologies. By providing students with access to higher education, we are bolstering every sector of our economy from medical research to manufacturing because we are creating the next generation of innovators and leaders. Investing in our younger generations will not only help our students and families who are need; it strengthens America. 
   The promise of the American Dream is the glue that holds our communities together. It was educational opportunity that provided me, the proud daughter of a working family, to obtain a first-rate education and ultimately find my way to the floor of the House of Representatives to fight for what is right. By denying the opportunities afforded by access to higher education, we deny our families their share of the American Dream. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act addresses this crisis in a fiscally sound and responsible manner. It is funded by cutting unnecessary subsidies to private lenders and putting our taxpayer dollars to work for the American people. So, Mr. Speaker, this act will not only put college back in reach for our families; it does so by cutting almost $21 billion in taxpayer subsidies to private lenders and reinvesting over $20 billion of the savings in our Nation's students and putting an additional $750 million towards reducing our Nation's deficit. 
   Specifically, the College Cost Reduction Act will cut the interest rates on subsidized student loans in half. The bill invests heavily in the much-needed, need-based Pell Grant scholarship program, increasing the maximum award by at least $1,090 over the next 5 years and expanding eligibility for the grants. By passing this bill, we will make a college education possible for hundreds of thousands of additional students over the next 5 years. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation also recognizes the value of our public servants by providing them with loan forgiveness for those who choose to serve in the jobs that make our world turn: teachers, firefighters, nurses, law enforcement officers, and librarians. 
   Further, the College Cost Reduction Act provides upfront tuition assistance to qualified undergraduates who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities. This bill invests in the strength of our communities and of our country. And the return on our investment as a Nation in our students and people will, without question, provide an enormous return. 
   Mr. Speaker, the crisis of college cost is pervasive, and it is getting worse. It is long past the time that Congress take action to ensure that a college education is not a privilege reserved only for the wealthy. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support our children and our families by voting for the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Today, we take a great step towards regaining the faith of the American people as we pass the College Cost Reduction Act to provide hundreds of thousands of American families with the opportunity to create a better life for their children. I am proud to be a part of that effort. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act is a fiscally responsible bill which makes the single largest investment in college aid since the GI Bill, which, as we all know, provided our Greatest Generation with the opportunity to create the Nation we know today. 
   This legislation invests over $20 billion in student aid, and does so with no additional cost to the taxpayers. 
   Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to again applaud the extraordinary leadership of Chairman George Miller in making college affordability a top priority.     
   Under his guidance, all of the members of the Education and Labor Committee have crafted a good bill that works for our families and our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this investment in our children, in our economy and in our future, to keep faith with the American people, and to send a clear message that the American Dream is not a relic of the past, but a cornerstone of our future. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, trade is a complex issue. But some things are very clear--We need a fair playing field for our workers and businesses and we need a new trade model, with enforceable standards and rules to eliminate unfair trade practices. 
   So why are we continuing to seek to expand a trade policy that has proven time and time again to be harmful for American workers, businesses, farmers and communities? And why are we seeking to expand the Andean Trade Preference Act or ATPA when there appears no substantive reason to extend the preferences. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), we have a $10 billion and growing trade deficit with the four ATPA nations, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. American farmers and workers have been directly harmed by the ATPA as can be seen with our asparagus and fresh-cut flower industries. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, these domestic producers have been affected by lower prices and many growers have gone out of business as a result. 
   Under the ATPA, flower imports from Colombia and Ecuador receive duty-free treatment, seven though the workers who grow, harvest, and package these flowers routinely experience a number of labor rights and human rights violations. By law, the ATPA is supposed to condition these trade benefits on improvements in worker rights in these countries. However, labor rights violations in the flower industry and other sectors, including violations of the right to freedom of association, continue unchecked. 
   Where is the enforcement from the Bush Administration? Where is the outrage from this Congress. 
   Also promised to us when the ATPA was enacted in 1991 was a reduction in coca production in the four ATPA countries. However, in Colombia, according to the CRS, coca crop size estimates remain mostly unchanged since the enactment of the ATPA and in Peru coca crop cultivation has actually grown. Colombia remains the source of roughly 90 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. In a 2001 report to Congress, the U.S. Foreign Agricultural Service said that they ``do not believe that Peruvian asparagus production provides an alternative economic opportunity for coca producers and workers--the stated purpose of the Act.'' And all this is on top of the fact that Colombia has an appalling horrific record on labor and human rights--Leading the world in the number of unionists murdered year after year. 
   So why are we seeking to give Colombia further trade preferences?

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the State of Israel on the occasion of its 60th anniversary. Since its declaration of independence, Israel has stood as a strong ally and friend of the United States. This friendship stems from the commonalities that led to our respective foundings and our shared hopes for the future of the global community. 
   In forging a new nation, Israel established a home for people that were targeted for extermination and ostracism in other lands. From an arduous beginning, Israel's rise has come to mirror our own. Hailing from more than 100 countries on five continents, Israel's population exudes a diversity of culture and ideas. Israel has flourished through the development of a diverse and technologically advanced economy and has come to exemplify the best of what a democracy can be. 
   Our countries have stood by one another in peace and in war. And we will continue to stand together in fighting terrorism and threats from stateless actors and rogue nations. 
   I congratulate and celebrate with Israel and am proud to be part of the continued friendship between our countries.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2992, the SBA Trade Programs Act. 
   I want to thank Congressman Hall for introducing this important bill and for his continued efforts to ensure our trade policies work for American businesses and workers. 
   I also want to applaud the distinguished chairwoman, Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, for her leadership on this issue and dedication to helping our small businesses. 
   This bill could not be more relevant because small businesses in Ohio and across the Nation are struggling to compete because of sometimes misguided U.S. trade policies and unfair and often illegal foreign trade practices. 
   Small businesses and their workers are the backbone of communities in Ohio and across this Nation. Just listen to the statistics: 
   Small businesses comprise 97 percent of all export enterprises but only generate 30 percent of domestic export revenues, and that number is shrinking. This is happening because our trade policies often benefit large corporate interests and leave small businesses behind. 
   The trends also show that it is becoming more and more difficult for American small businesses to compete against the unfair trade practices of foreign nations, often propped up by governmental subsidies, weak intellectual property laws, and currency manipulation. 
   H.R. 2992 will help small businesses become more competitive in the international trade market. This bill will provide a comprehensive set of resources to help small businesses by increasing export assistance, strengthening small business trade policies, and providing adjustment assistance. 
   These are very important steps we can take at the Small Business Administration to help our local firms stay competitive; and while this will help small business compete both domestically and globally, there is clearly much more that needs to be done, including an overhaul of U.S. trade policy to ensure that the needs of American businesses and workers and communities are being met. 
   Unfortunately, our current trade policies put American businesses and workers often at a disadvantage and reward companies who move overseas or outsource jobs, and for communities like mine, Mr. Speaker, in northeast Ohio where the creation and retention of jobs is the number one issue, supporting our local industries and small businesses will be critical to our ability to revitalize our economy and succeed in the future. 
   Today, we move in the right direction by passing the SBA Trade Programs Act; and, once again, I applaud Congressman Hall and Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for their leadership on this important issue and for the hard work that they are doing.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on this issue and for yielding me the time. 
   Today I rise in favor of the rule and in favor of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. On my first day in office representing Ohio's 13th District, under the leadership of the new Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, I stood on the floor of the House in support of a new ethics rules package, a rules package that put an end to the K Street Project, that ended gifts and perks and trips, and that made a historic move towards cleansing the inner workings of government. 
   This rules package was extraordinary in its scope and its breadth, but it was only the beginning. In our fight against the climate of excess that flourished under recent Republican leadership of this body, it is clear we must take further action. We must continue to eradicate the pay-to-play culture that has pervaded and all too often undermined lawmaking in the Congress. 
   We must expose and eliminate the strings and the coziness that have resulted in policies by the special interests for the special interests. We must end the culture of corruption so we remain focused and truly tend to the people's business. 
   When I ran to represent Ohio's 13th District, I made it clear that I wanted to go to Congress to change the way business was being done and to restore the public trust. Safeguarding the public trust is not a part-time job. It must always remain uppermost in our minds. It requires the observation of current rules, and it requires legislative action to cure problems that persist. 
   Today we take the next step to bring the cleansing light of day to political financial contributions and to reduce the potential for shady lobbying practices.     
   This bill focuses on sanitizing the relationship that lobbyists have with Congress. It gives the American people the ability to follow the money. It increases the number of times per year that lobbyists must file disclosure reports, and it requires electronic filing of these reports, making it available to the American public on the Internet. To increase public disclosure, we will shed needed light on the money trail from lobbyists to Capitol Hill. 
   This bill also requires lobbyists to certify that they have not provided elected Members of Congress with gifts or travel forbidden by the rules of the  House. This is another means to ensure that the past practice of special interests using gifts and perks to woo legislators is truly coming to an end. 
   When lobbying laws and congressional rules are violated, the American people suffer. They suffer in policy, and they suffer in spirit. They are cheated out of their right to proper representation. The action we are taking today provides for greater punishment for the violation of these laws by those who are willing to betray the public trust. 
   When Americans went to the polls last November, they sent a clear message that they're concerned about the state of government. I have long believed that what people truly want from their Representative is someone who understands their concerns and who will strive to do all that they can on their behalf. The American people want to know that we are here for them, not for lobbyists, not for special interests, not for self-interests. They deserve nothing less. 
   Today, thanks to an amendment made in order by this rule, we also take action to bring much-needed transparency to the practice of lobbyists' bundling of campaign contributions. The American people deserve to know the source of campaign contributions, as well as the sometimes lengthy and roundabout paths that these campaign contributions travel before they are placed into the hands of candidates. 
   Our bill gives the American people a window into the lobbying practices and fund-raising activities by requiring the disclosure of bundled contributions collected by lobbyists for candidates. 
   This Democratic Congress is working to restore and ensure the trust of our constituents. One step was the elimination of soft money, the next step the House rules package. We can't stop there.  
   In closing I just want to say, as a new member of Congress, Mr. Speaker, how very honored I am to have been given the awesome opportunity and responsibility to represent the people of the thirteenth district of Ohio. Every day, I cherish the trust that they have placed in me to do all that I can on their behalf. I know that others in this body feel just as strongly as I do about their own constituents. We must pass this bill to restore the hope and live up to the promise that those we have been sent to serve have placed in us. Our constituents must know and it must be true, that it is they that are always uppermost in our hearts and minds as we carry out our responsibilities. I am pleased to support this rule, this bill, and the amendment to disclose the bundling of campaign contributions. I respectfully urge my colleagues to join in passing them.  
   I urge the passage of the rule, the bill and the amendment on bundling.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable chairwoman for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, our troops are brave and capable. They have fought heroically. But, Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to tell our President that he can no longer ignore the American people, this Congress or the reality of the situation we face in Iraq. 
   We have the responsibility to provide oversight, to ensure that our brave and honorable troops are provided a mission based on a realistic assessment and an achievable goal before we ask them to risk life and limb to implement it. We must end the strain that we have put on our brave military men and women and their families, and we must act today. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know we must get our troops out of the crossfire and the violence of the raging civil war in Iraq. We know what must be done for our soldiers in Iraq to ensure the protection of them and our families here at home. Our military and our National Guard are stretched thin. We must rebuild and re-equip both. Our National Guard in Ohio is training and working on gear that is obsolete. So not only are our military men and women at risk in Iraq; we have our homeland exposed to national emergencies and other threats that we may face. But our President has refused to acknowledge the reality of the situation that we face as a Nation, and I and many other Members of this Congress will not allow the status quo to continue. 
   For this reason, I cosponsored and will cast a powerful ``yes'' vote in support of H.R. 2237. This bill, authored by Mr. McGovern, whom I respect tremendously for his courage and leadership, is responsible and will ensure the safe redeployment of our troops from Iraq. Our bill calls for the redeployment of our troops and allows Congress to take back from the President the reckless decisionmaking that we have seen. 
   Our bill also very importantly ensures a number of things: it protects the ability of our military to go after al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in Iraq; it provides for the protection of diplomatic and other related U.S. personnel in Iraq; and, finally, it will truly shift our role in Iraq to training and equipping the Iraqi security forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has come to end this war; and, unfortunately, the failed policies of this administration and lack of oversight from past Congresses have left us with few options. 3,372 of our troops, including 157 brave military men and women from Ohio, have died in this war. It is time we did the responsible thing for our heroic soldiers, for their families and for our Nation.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a new Congress. This is a Congress with respect for the Constitution and the principles for which it stands. This is a Congress that respects the underlying principle that people in this country deserve the right to be represented and to have a voice in this great democracy of ours. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in support of this legislation that is long overdue and which will correct an anomaly in our democracy, an anomaly which denies representation to approximately 600,000 residents of this country. 
   Residents of the District of Columbia have had to wait over 170 years to vote in this country's Presidential election. They have had to wait for over 180 years for the right to exercise home rule. They have had to wait for over 200 years to have a vote in the House of Representatives. And we should not make them wait one day more. 
   These residents live in the shadow of our great Capitol, who pay taxes to our Federal Government, who serve in our military, who fight and die to protect the very representative rights that we have in this country, but yet we deny these citizens the right to have control over the laws that govern our country. They have no Representative who can vote in this House of Representatives. 
   This past Monday, Mr. Speaker, the residents of the District of Columbia engaged in an act of grass-roots lobbying in its purest form. Thousands of these unrepresented residents marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol on the city's annual Emancipation Day, marking the day that slavery ended in the District. They marched to the Capitol to ask this legislative body to recognize and rectify the injustice that they experience every single day. They marched for the right to have a say in this legislative body. These citizens, these students, these senior citizens, workers, activists, and church members marched to have a vote. 
   This is a Congress that respects the Constitution. And my respect for the Constitution goes back to very early days. And one of the greatest things that I have ever received was recognition, even in law school, by the Federal Bar Association for outstanding performance in constitutional law. 
   The Framers of our Constitution gave Congress the right to make laws concerning the District of Columbia, and it is under the power of the District clause of the Constitution that I join today in supporting the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act. 
   This is long overdue. The last Congress earned the distinction of being called the ``worse than the do-nothing Congress.'' This is a Congress that is going to get the job done, and this is a Congress that is going to respect the Constitution.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Ellison. What a great leader you are, and we thank you for putting this hour together. 
   I am happy to join with these other distinguished colleagues to speak to the American people about the change that is upon us and the hope that is growing. 
   We did hear from the voters loud and clear on November 7. And one of the things that they wanted was a Congress that is responsive to the priorities and needs that exist out there in our communities. One of the things that had been getting in the way of getting that kind of legislation that was truly responsive was the corruption that unfortunately had flourished in this body for quite some time. 
   I also think it is important that we point out the fact that on the day that this Congress opened, we came right down on this floor and we changed the rules to put to an end some of the abusive avenues that existed that resulted in policies that benefited the few at the expense of the many. And, frankly, that was part of the foundation that had to be laid in order to get these other things passed. 
   When you talk about economic justice, and I know we are going to talk about this more this evening, I am very pleased to be a member of the Budget Committee. And the good news is we did recently pass a budget out of this body. The bad news is, when I got to the Budget Committee and I started hearing things about what our fiscal condition was, it was as bad as we feared it was from afar. But, again, because we have a new Congress and because we have change in this Congress, we were able to realign the resources that were there so that at least they met the needs and the priorities of our constituents and the American people and the communities that they live in. 
   So I am very happy to be here with you to talk about all of these things this evening, and I direct it back to you, our leader, Mr. Ellison.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Congressman Ellison; I certainly will. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act was a great accomplishment by this Congress, a bill that will make it easier for workers out there, the people who make this world turn. 
   I stand here in front of you as the daughter of a man who worked in a boilermaker factory his whole life.     
   The sister of a steelworker. The sister of a teacher. The aunt of a food and commercial worker. And these are the people that make the world turn. 
   Yet we hear often that people are not in unions, that union membership is down. Well, it is not because they don't want to be in unions, because we know that being a member of a union and having the right to bargain collectively for fair wages and family-sustaining benefits is something that people do desire and does result in exactly that, a fairer wage and benefits. 
   Frankly, it works for business as well, and there are many examples out  there where employers and employees work. But, unfortunately, part of the big reason why union membership is down is because it is very dangerous and sometimes results in the loss of a job if you engage in trying to organize workers into a union so that they can bargain collectively. 
   So this Congress, noting that, noting the need to end the potential for harassment for those who would just simply seek to organize and have their voice heard collectively, passed the Employee Free Choice Act which will enable workers to just simply, if there is a majority of them who want to join a union, then they can sign a card and join a union. So it is going to truly be an effective tool in lifting up America's workers and the middle class. 
   I turn it back over to you, Mr. Ellison.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (TRADE AND LABOR -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Congressman Hare, your leadership on this issue is 
   unparalleled; and on behalf of not just myself but all those whom I represent in the Thirteenth District of Ohio, we thank you so much. 
   Thank you for organizing this Special Order hour. It is so important that we communicate the truth about what is going on and hopefully with the intent to influence it in a way that will make a difference in the lives of those we represent. 
   Last November, the American people and the people back in the Thirteenth District of Ohio cast their vote to put an end to the flawed trade model that has had a devastating impact on our families, our businesses, our workers, our farmers and our communities and the tax base of our communities. 
   Last week or a week or so ago, an announcement was made that the U.S. will require the inclusion of labor and environmental standards in the pending Peru and Panama free trade agreements. This is welcome news. But while it might appear encouraging that these deals seemingly provide for the possibility of stronger labor and environmental standards, any enforceability of those standards, unfortunately, is dependent upon the Bush administration; and, given its abominable record, you can be certain that enforcement will not happen. 
   Why do I say that? Well, for example, in 2000, Congress passed a free trade agreement with Jordan. That agreement had the support of many Members in this body who were committed to fair trade. Because it included those labor and environmental standards, they supported and voted for it. However, there has been no enforcement of those labor standards, even though documented violations have been extreme. 
   So there is really little reason to believe that the same result would not prove true with the pending FTAs, even if they contain similar standards. The language on a written paper is not enough. It has to be enforced. 
   My constituents and the people across this country voted for a much greater change in direction on trade than simply including labor and environmental standards which won't be enforced into our agreements. The American people cast their votes for a new majority in both the House and the Senate, hoping that we would help strengthen the shrinking middle-class, restore the American dream that has been offshored due to the harmful trade agreements and unfair trade practices that have persisted for more than a decade. 
   The American people are counting on this new Congress in this moment to finally address the devastation of our failed trade policies and the soaring trade deficit by developing a new trade model that will no longer leave American businesses and workers at a disadvantage. They are counting on us to enact a trade model that will not reward companies who move overseas or encourage them to outsource jobs or our future. They are counting on us to develop a trade model that will put an enforceable end to illegal subsidies and currency manipulation. They are counting on us to develop a trade model that will provide incentives to help our businesses and workers and our communities thrive. They are counting on us to develop a trade model that requires reciprocity of market access and ensures greater safety of products produced elsewhere and consumed here. 
   The American people are counting on the Democratic majority in this new Congress to provide a trade model that will truly allow for fair competition, because we know that, if given a fair playing field, we will excel in the global marketplace. 
   This is not about being pro-trade or anti-trade. This is about the rules of trade and making sure that they are fair and enforceable. The American people want nothing more, and they deserve nothing less. 
   I am committed to continuing the fight to deliver to the American people a truly new trade model that fixes this broken system that is fair and under which we will prosper. 
   With respect to the pending Panama and Peru FTAs, which represent only a minute portion of trade with the U.S., I have yet to see them in full. However, it should be understood that Congress must reclaim its constitutional authority and responsibility over trade and not continue down the path of ceding our responsibility to the administration. It is our job to assure a vibrant and fair trade policy. We must focus  our attention on that task before it is too late. 
   My home State of Ohio has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001. Sometimes I am dismissed because I come from a State that has been hit hard. People say, oh, well, she is just from a place where it has felt it, but we can just write that off, because it is not affecting that many people. 
   Well, in the first instance, it is not okay to write off the people of Ohio. A lot of families are suffering, though, beyond my district's borders, and they need a new trade model now. The inclusion of labor standards and environmental standards in trade agreements means little if they won't be enforced.     
   And it means little if we don't fix the broken system. 
   When I arrived here as a freshman member of this class I am so honored to be a part of, I listened to my freshmen colleagues, and I heard them talking about how these issues, this issue, this issue of trade was hurting the people they represented. They came from one side of the country to the other, from the top to the bottom, from Florida to New Hampshire, Iowa to Ohio to Pennsylvania. All across this country people are feeling the ill effects of our failed trade model. We must develop a new trade model that is enforceable and comprehensive, and we must do it immediately to keep the faith with the American people.

   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you, Congressman Hare. 
   Let me start out by saying I am so honored to be a Representative from Ohio. The people of my district and my great State are the salt of the Earth. All they want is a job where they can work and raise their families and give them an opportunity for a future that we all dream of. 
   That is the kind of opportunity that my parents had. My dad worked in the boilermaker factory his whole life. Here I am, his daughter, standing in Congress. Every day that I am here, I am going to make sure that I am looking out for the people who have the same dream that probably your parents and my parents shared, and that is just for a good day for themselves and their family and a bright future based on those opportunities. 
   Now, I, like you, Congressman Hare and Congressman Michaud, I believe trade can benefit American businesses and workers and be a tool to help developing countries looking to access our markets. But this that has been presented is not a new trade model that will get us there. 
   Our window for creating a new trade model is closing because it is becoming increasingly hard for our businesses to survive here, and that is not the American way, is it? That is not acceptable. I, with you, I know will continue to fight to change that.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 275 provides for consideration of H. Con. Res. 99, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008 under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 4 hours of general debate, three to be controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the Budget and one to be controlled by Representative Maloney of New York and Representative Saxton of New Jersey. 
   The rule also makes in order three substitute amendments by Representative Scott of Virginia, Representative Woolsey and Representative Ryan of Wisconsin. 
   Madam Speaker, budgets, more than anything else this government produces, are a statement of what matters to us and what does not. They are moral documents. They tell us to what degree we care to look after the old and protect the young. They indicate our responsibilities to commitments both abroad and here at home. They give life to our greatest dreams as a Nation. They are the hope we leave for our children and become the legacy we bestow upon our people. 
   And they can be examples of great courage, or an absolution of Congress's responsibility to set priorities consistent with strengthening our people and our communities. 
   Madam Speaker, as it concerns the budget, it has been a long 6 years for this Nation. The budget has been out of balance fiscally, and it has been out of balance with the needs of the American people. 
   Just 6 years ago, we were looking at a projected $5.6 trillion surplus. That has collapsed into a $9 trillion deficit. For every American in this country, there is $29,000 worth of debt. 
   And to add insult to injury, most of the debt we have taken on in recent years will be sent to investors in foreign countries. 
   It goes far beyond having been drunk at the wheel. Our predecessors in the majority not only crashed the car into a ditch, they accelerated after landing there, allowing mud to cave in on top of it. 
   That was the fiscal situation Democrats found when we arrived here a few months ago in the majority. 
   Since President Bush took office in 2001, my home State of Ohio alone has lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs; and 3 million have been lost nationwide. 
   Job growth overall has slowed to a significantly slower pace in recent years than under the Clinton administration, at a rate even below the level necessary to keep pace with population growth. Sadly, our families have even less purchasing power today than they did in January of 2001. 
   And the debt has continued to pile up, with no accountability, no fiscal responsibility, no effort to place priorities in the right places, to curb wasteful spending, to do what needs to be done to make sure that the programs consistent with the values of this Nation, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, SCHIP and Community Block Grants continue to be able to survive. 
   In short, the policies enacted in recent years will have devastating effects on our future competitiveness and standard of living if we continue down the same destructive road. 
   But it is a new day, and we have a new path to follow, one that says that it is more important to take care of our wounded veterans than it is to take care of oil companies, one that says that kids cannot grow up to thrive and give back to this great Nation if they do not have the health care when they are young, one that says that a measure of a Nation can be taken in small things like heating assistance for the elderly and nutrition programs in local schools and special assistance for those with disabilities. 
   Indeed, it is in the small print of the Federal budget that we find our worth as a government, which is why I am proud, both as a member of the Budget Committee, and as a Member of Congress, to support this Democratic budget. 
   It is the first time in a very long time that Congress has before it a budget that is fiscally responsible and in line with the needs of the American people.     
   This budget makes critical investments in education, health care, our veterans, our communities and our economy while at the same time adhering to PAYGO principles and returning our budget to balance by 2012. The reckless economic policies of the last 6 years have been immensely damaging to our economy's long-term global competitiveness and particularly to our workers. 
   The Democratic budget will strengthen middle-class families by providing funding for job training programs,  health care, and education, particularly in math and science. These are all essential investments in our workforce that will lay a solid foundation for a growing economy and improve our competitiveness. The Democratic budget rejects the President's draconian cuts to programs that provide health care to the poor, to our children, and our seniors. Nine million of the neediest children in this country and 242,000 in the State of Ohio lack health insurance coverage, and the funding levels in the President's budget put as many as 1 million of these children at risk to fall off the SCHIP program by 2012. In contrast, the Democratic budget provides for a $50 billion increase to SCHIP, allowing us to reach millions more children than we reach right now, making our children's health care needs a Federal Government priority. 
   The Democratic budget also rejects the $300 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts proposed by the administration. Access to health care should be a right, not a privilege, in this Nation and it does not serve any of us to roll back the clock on the health care initiatives that have served us so well up until now. 
   The Democratic budget is also about investing in our communities. It provides for increased funding for Community Development Block Grants, the Social Service Block Grants, and it saves Community Services Block Grants which was zeroed out in the President's budget. I have personally spoken with a number of the community officials in my own district that would have been affected by the proposed cuts in block grant programs and I will tell you that at the local level, these programs are lifelines for our neighborhoods and towns. They address needs in affordable housing, education and nutrition. They promote financial literacy and assist with child care needs and special services to children with disabilities. And in our cities, the CDBG funds help provide affordable housing and services to our most vulnerable populations. In short, we should not be trying to do away with programs that work. 
   The Democratic budget also makes education a priority, from early childhood to lifelong learning. To that end, our budget provides $3 billion over the current services level for education, training and social services. These increases are an investment in our future and will be vital to our global competitiveness. We have increased funding for those just beginning their education, like the 38,000 children in Head Start in Ohio, and we have taken steps to make college education more affordable through Pell Grants and a higher education reserve fund. We have included funds to train more math and science teachers. 
   Finally, the Democratic budget reflects a major shift in priorities by providing for a $5.4 billion increase in the Veterans Affairs budget which is an 18.1 percent increase over 2007 levels and the largest increase in history. Recently it has become clear that the needs of our brave men and women who have served our country so honorably have not been met. We have heard heartbreaking stories of wounded veterans who must wait up to 6 months for disability determinations and about VA facilities that are in disrepair. The more than 1 million veterans in Ohio and the more than 24 million nationwide deserve nothing less than our full support. Anything less is simply unacceptable. 
   A budget reflects the soul of a nation. It can give life to our most honorable pursuits and provide proof of the best of our intentions. It is the Rosetta Stone which those who look upon us from the present and from the future can decipher our worth and our courage. 
   It is with those thoughts in mind that I am proud to present this budget for consideration by the House. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   In a document released March 28, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated: ``Some are claiming that the budget plan adopted last week by the House Budget Committee, which the full House is expected to vote on this week, would constitute `the largest tax increase in history.' This claim is incorrect. The House plan does not include a tax increase.'' That is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated. 
   Mr. Speaker, last November the American people made it clear they are ready for a government that will be fiscally responsible. This Nation spoke loud and clear when it put a new party in power in Congress, asking for responsibility and a new direction in our fiscal priorities. Education, health care, the care of our children and our seniors and our veterans, these are issues that Americans are concerned about. 
   Our budget restores common sense to our national spending and sanity to our national priorities. It restores the President's attempt to cut children's health care programs and Community Block Grants, and it puts forth the single largest increase in veterans spending in our Nation's history, and not a moment too soon. 
   It funds math and science programs for our kids, and programs like Head Start and Pell Grants that provide access to education that so many of our children need. And this budget concerns itself with the need to create jobs and build a bright economic future. It restores funding for job training programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to be accountable to American taxpayers once again. It is time for Congress to be accountable to our children's future once again. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time for her leadership on this rule and in the Armed Services Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in strong support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. It is an outrage that our brave men and women, who have served our Nation so honorably, have returned home, as recent press accounts have revealed, and faced problems getting the care they so rightly deserve. 
   As I said before, our troops must have, and we must provide, that which they need for any mission upon which they are sent. They must have and we must provide that which they need when they return home. 
   My home State of Ohio has 6,347 brave soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. If they are injured in any way, they must have the care they need when they return home. The roughly 60,000 veterans in my congressional district and over 1 million veterans in Ohio and all of our veterans across this Nation deserve better support and assistance than many of them have received. 
   The legislation before us arose out of a lack of oversight and transparency that should have been in place, but was neglected by the administration and past Congresses. This bipartisan bill ensures that our wounded soldiers and their families can feel secure in the knowledge that they will now be properly cared for and treated with the respect and dignity that they have earned and most certainly deserve. This bill will ensure that all of our veterans get the care and assistance they need and improves the overall veterans health care system to make it easier for them to access and use. 
   Lastly, this bill puts in place strong oversight and inspection requirements to ensure that the events of Walter  Reed and other facilities around this Nation never, ever happen again. 
   Let's pass this rule and pass this very important bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3021, 21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1234 provides for consideration of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Facilities Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order eight amendments which are printed in the Rules Committee report. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in strong support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facilities Act. This legislation is important and groundbreaking because it simultaneously addresses important issues confronting our Nation in the 21st century, improving our education system, modernizing our buildings and infrastructures to be environmentally sustainable, and creating jobs to grow our economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's school districts are struggling to make essential improvements during these lean economic times. According to recent estimates, America's schools are hundreds of billions of dollars short of the funding needed to ensure that every student attends a high quality facility. Too many parents across this country are forced to drop off their children at schools that are falling apart, schools with leaking roofs and faulty electrical systems, schools with outdated technology which compromises their ability to achieve and succeed. 
   Our bill provides $33.2 billion over 5 years for schools across the country for projects to modernize, renovate, and repair their facilities. This funding is crucial to improve our schools so that  the students have a healthy and safe environment in which to learn and develop the knowledge and the skills necessary to compete in today's workforce. 
   H.R. 3021 also addresses disparities in school facilities funding. It directs the Secretary of Education to distribute funds to school districts according to the same need-based formula used under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which provides funding for low income school districts. Funding provided in this bill can be used for energy efficiency and technology improvements, asbestos removal and lead abatement, and for ensuring that schools are prepared for emergencies. The funding is provided with few restrictions, which will allow individual schools to satisfy their individual needs. 
   Renovating schools so that they are environmentally sustainable will provide numerous health and educational benefits for students. Increasing air quality and lighting will enhance our students' ability to focus and learn, while reducing student sick days and improving the health of students with asthma and other respiratory problems.     
   Green schools also cost about 2 percent less than conventional schools, while providing financial benefits that are 20 times as large, utilizing 33 percent less energy and 32 percent less water than traditional schools. 
   Enabling students to attend environmentally sustainable schools not only insures a healthy learning environment. It will also naturally facilitate environmental literacy in our youth. This will help our children grow into stewards of our environment and natural resources that we must treasure and preserve for future generations. 
   Unfortunately, many schools in my district and across the Nation are also forced to address difficult security challenges. For example, Brunswick High School in my district is the largest single-level high school building in Ohio, stretching a quarter of a mile from end to end with 60 entrances. As you can imagine, this presents a formidable security challenge for teachers and administrators. 
   For these reasons, Congresswoman McCarthy and I have worked to include a provision in the manager's amendment for this legislation that will allow schools to improve building infrastructure to accommodate security measures and security doors. 
   This bill authorizes $100 million a year through 2013 specifically for public schools in the gulf coast that are still working to rebuild from the devastation that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita wrought three years ago. 
   Families in the gulf coast are still fighting to recover and to put their lives back together. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to devote extra resources so that those schools and those communities can rebuild. 
   School modernization is the central purpose of 3021. Equally important and necessary is the essential economic stimulus that this bill will provide by creating more than 100,000 new jobs for American workers who design and build schools, from roofing contractors, construction workers and electricians, to architects and engineers. It's estimated that this bill will result in the creation of nearly 4,000 jobs in my home State of Ohio in 2009 alone. 
   Mr. Speaker, in these challenging economic times, important and innovative legislation such as this bill will go a long way to creating new opportunities for America's workforce. Passing this bill will enable school districts to upgrade their facilities and lead our Nation's students towards a brighter and healthier future while addressing the job crisis we face today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues who may be listening to this debate that this rule and this bill are about repairing and improving our Nation's schools. 
   I also want to remind the people at home that, of course, those who are railing now about the effects of energy policy over the past 6 or so or 8 or 10 years were in charge, most of that time with a Republican President, and this is what we get. 
   So this Congress, of course, is a new majority, and we have taken bold steps to put incentives in place that will lead to historic change and will turn the corner to renewable sources of energy in this country being developed. 
   We have 30 million acres on which oil drilling can take place right now, and those are just sitting idle. Those on the other side of the aisle don't tell us the whole story when they're talking about these issues. 
   But I just want to repeat, I want to remind my colleagues who may be listening to this debate, that this rule and this bill is about the very important business of repairing and improving our Nation's schools. 
   With that, I reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, as we lead this country in the 21st century, we must work creatively to form policies that address the intertwining nature of the challenges we face. 
   I've heard that this isn't important legislation from the other side of the aisle, and that is concerning to me because safe and healthy schools are important. Environmentally sustainable schools are important. Creating 100,000 jobs in this country is important. Acting to instill environmental stewardship in students and our youth is important. 
   One out of five Americans attends school each day. A 2006 report concluded that, despite significant State and local expenditures on school construction and renovation from 1996 to 2004, there continues to be millions of students in substandard and overcrowded school conditions. This bill will set our 60 million school children on a path to a better education and a healthier future by providing a Federal investment to help renovate, prepare, and modernize thousands of public schools. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (FAST TRACK TRADE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Thank you so much, Mr. Michaud, and Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ. Both of you, your leadership is a shining example for all of us. As you point out, this is a moment of supreme importance when it comes to the trade policy of this country. 
   Last November, the American people cast their votes for new leaders with the hope that we would replace our broken trade system with one that will truly allow for fair competition, because we know that if given a fair playing field, we will excel in the global marketplace. 
   The first step, as both of you so rightfully point out, has to be that Congress must stop ceding its constitutional authority and responsibility over trade to the President. The lack of oversight and accountability, giving the President what's been called Fast Track authority, the damage that Fast Track authority has wrought on the United States trade policy has led to devastating consequences, some of which you have already heard about throughout this country. It certainly has had a devastating impact on the area that I represent. We have lost over 200,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio since 2000. 
   That means that people's futures have been seriously put at risk. There are kids out there today who won't be able to go to college because of the jobs that their parents lost due to Fast Track, and the bad trade deals that resulted under Fast Track. There are people out there who won't have health care for their families because of the bad policy that has resulted under Fast Track. 
   For them and for every American who has been hurt by the Bush administration's harmful trade policies, we must, we must let Fast Track expire permanently at the end of this month. Now, we all know that the United States' Constitution gives responsibility for trade to the Congress, and there was a reason for that. 
   Our forefathers knew that they needed to keep that issue and control over that issue at a level that is closely connected to the people who are being represented. That's why Congress had that authority. 
   Unfortunately, with Fast Track, the problem is the administration negotiates the deals, signs them, determines all the terms, and then weighs it before Congress, and you have to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' You have no input on what the constraints are. You have no  say or ability to fix what is wrong with the deals as they come through. That is just not a path we should continue down. 
   As has been mentioned, Fast Track has enabled the passage of trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA, and of course the WTO, the World Trade Organization, all of that has accelerated as our leader here has pointed out, it's all accelerated a trade in jobs crisis. It's marked by an $800 billion trade deficit, and more and more people are feeling this across the country. 
   In fact, I actually have a letter here that was sent to our leaders in both the House and the Senate from organizations, organizations like American Medical Students Association, The Change to Win Coalition, Communication Workers of America, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, hundreds, hundreds of organizations, national, State organizations; a wide variety of people, church organizations, all who oppose us extending Fast Track authority to the administration, because they know that the resulting trade deals are devastating to our communities, our businesses, our workers, our farmers and our country. 
   So it is with honor that I stand beside my two esteemed colleagues here tonight to talk a little bit about this with them and with all of you at home who care, I know, deeply about us changing the direction on our trade policy. 
   The good news is there are things that we could be doing, and that we should be doing to stop leaving our companies and our workers at a disadvantage.     
   And so I'm looking forward to exploring that with you both tonight. 
   And at this point, Mr. Michaud, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Michaud, again, your leadership is inspiring. 
   And, Mr. Ellison, thank you for being down here. You have been a tremendous leader on these issues, and your points about immigration and the complexity and the links between these subjects is well taken and important to recognize because, as you point out, Mr. Michaud, with the numbers about the value-added tax, the VAT tax, there is nothing free about that. When they call it ``free trade,'' you kind of think you are going to get something good back in return, and it just hasn't been working. 
   And the reality is when you read the quote by the former Attorney General, at that point the issue was theoretical. It was hypothetical. We didn't know for a fact actually what would happen. We thought. We had our ideas. We had our suspicions. But it is no longer theoretical. We know how this trade model has failed, and it doesn't make sense for us to continue down that same path.     
   You know, we had some talk here this evening about some of the trade deals that are still pending under the Fast Track authority that the administration still maintains. And a couple of those were mentioned in passing, including the pending deals with Peru and Panama, and of course Colombia and Korea. And recently, the administration and some congressional leaders actually announced that the labor and environmental standards were going to be included in the Peru and Panama agreements. However, right after that announcement, reports indicated that those standards may be put into side letters, where we've seen them go and not be enforced. And we also heard those who represent the multinational interests who are benefitting under our current broken trade policy boast that the standards will not be enforceable. Those are concerning developments. 
   And I guess it is also important to note that, even if the standards are ultimately in the core of the FTAs, experience tells us that they will not be enforced. In 2000, Congress passed the Free Trade Agreement with Jordan, and it had those labor and environmental standards in it. As a result, it received broad support. Actually, some of those who believe in fair trade and are committed to it voted for it because of those standards. But you know, alas, despite documented violation upon documented violation, those standards have not been enforced. 
   So getting back to sort of the points that you have all been making, rather than continuing to pass more free trade agreements that won't be enforced and will result in the consequences we've seen under the broken trade system, which means more lost jobs, a bigger trade deficit, more of the negative consequences, not just in this country, but it's out of whack all over; rather than doing that, it makes sense for us to focus on things like that of Mr. Ryan's bill that will help to fix our broken system. 
   You know, Congress should focus on replacing policies that reward businesses for outsourcing jobs with incentives and should focus on sensible tax policies and would help businesses and workers make it in America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. The gentleman asks a good question. No. No. The answer is no. And I think that that's an important point. And our colleague, Ms. S&#225;nchez, made a very important point, too, about how this administration feels about human rights and workers' rights because she talked about the fact that they negotiated, this administration, an agreement with Colombia, where the murder of labor organizers and human rights violations are routine. And I think the fact that they are willing to enter into that agreement without being extremely diligent on correcting that tells us all we need to know about what this administration thinks about the need to enforce and deal with labor rights, labor standards and human rights. So I think that is very concerning. 
   If we deal with things, though, like currency manipulation and we deal with things like making sure that products that are produced elsewhere are safe for consumption here, because again, there are costs associated with safety. We have seen a lot of bad repercussions in recent days about products coming from outside of this country here. In fact, today, just today in USA Today was an article that dealt with lead in children's jewelry and how it  was hurting our kids, and China refusing to agree to changing that practice. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Maine.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Well, the gentleman asks a good question. He makes, actually, a great point, because the reality here is that we clearly don't have an enforceable system. First of all, the rules aren't good to start with. They're inadequate, and we have talked a lot about how they're inadequate. But the reality is, this Congress could do a myriad of things, actually, to shape the roles. And they shouldn't be left up to just sort of an, oh, maybe if it's a certain dollar amount, maybe if it affects something I care about. No, it really should be guided by the infraction itself, the infraction of the law, the infraction of the rule. 
   So, one way would be possibly to go down the path that you're talking about. And there are other avenues that we might pursue also. But the point is, we really need to fix it because you heard our esteemed colleague from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) talking about how we are investing in new technologies. And we all agree with that, we are all supporters of innovation. But when you have a company that is subsidizing and giving a 40 percent advantage from the start, all of the new technology, all of the education and workforce training in the world, all the increased productivity will never allow us to overcome that 40 percent head start. 
   So, again, the points are well taken. Rather than focusing on trade deals that are going to just take us down the same path to lost jobs, why don't we fix those things and then create a system in which trade can flourish? Because I believe in trade.

It is inexplicable, but the United States seems to be the only nation that does not find it acceptable to help our companies, to protect them, workers and communities, against unfair trade practices. And as a result, we are left at a disadvantage. All we are really asking for is that they have a fair shake. That's all we are asking for.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is something wrong when we have our seniors paying record high drug prices and drug companies reporting record profits. Our seniors deserve nothing less than access to affordable medicine, which they have earned through a lifetime of hard work. This legislation helps us achieve this by opening the door for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices. 
   Twenty-two million Americans would benefit from this proposal. Ninety-two percent of Americans support us providing this negotiating authority. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: This proposal is intricately linked to ethics reform. Last week we enacted historic changes, and now we are putting our seniors first and removing special interests from the picture. 
   The minority had a chance when they were in the majority to put forth a drug bill that helped seniors with the high cost of medicine. Instead, with backroom meetings, they choose to help the drug companies increase profits. 
   I am pleased as a cosponsor of this bill that we act today to help our seniors and keep our commitment to put their interests first.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4137, COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 956 provides for consideration of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor.  
   The rule makes in order the Education and Labor Committee reported substitute as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. 
   The rule makes in order the 27 amendments listed in the Rules Committee report, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes, except the Miller manager's amendment, which is debatable for 20 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, last year Congress passed the College Cost Reduction Act to increase college financial aid by $18 billion, the single largest increase in aid in over 60 years. That legislation significantly increased the maximum amount that Pell Grant recipients can receive at no new cost to taxpayers and was a strong start to this Congress' efforts to make higher education a reality for America's students. But that, Mr. Speaker, was just the beginning. 
   I'm proud to rise today in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This will continue our efforts to make college more affordable and more accessible for America's students, while making investments in critical areas to strengthen our workforce. 
   Our Nation is blessed to have the finest system of higher education in the world. There is a breadth of opportunities available to our graduating high school seniors: vocational and technical school, 2- and 4-year colleges, and graduate and professional schools. 
   Mr. Speaker, the challenge we face today is to ensure that our institutions of higher education are accessible to all, and the legislation we are passing today will make it easier for low-income and middle-class families to achieve the benefits of higher education as they climb up the ladder of success. 
   Investing in our students not only improves their future, but it helps our economy and strengthens our competitive edge in the global marketplace. This bill continues this Congress' efforts to strengthen America's workforce by creating programs to improve teacher training and bolster student interests in science, math, and technology. 
   We must also recognize and applaud our nontraditional students, those members of our workforce who are seizing the opportunity to continue their education while holding down full-time jobs and sometimes raising families. These students are often attending school less than half time, and thus, they sometimes benefit very little from traditional student aid. That's why I support my colleague Congressman Baird's amendment, which I hope will be incorporated into this bill, to require the Secretary of Education to study and recommend how best to design a loan program targeted at less than half-time students. 
   One of the keys to expanding access to our institutions of higher learning is to bring down the exorbitant cost of attending college. Tuition hikes in recent years have been stunning, amounting to a 31 percent increase at a 4-year public college in the last 5 years alone. 
   This bill enhances transparency in college tuition by requiring colleges to report their reasons for tuition hikes and the plans they have for lowering costs. It also requires the Secretary of Education to publish a higher education price index, providing students with the opportunity to compare institutions by State, sector, and change in tuition and fees from one year to the next. This will allow students to make wiser decisions in choosing institutions that are a good fit for them and the dreams to which they aspire. 
   A more immediate way to make the possibility of attaining a college degree a reality is to increase the aid available to our students, and I'm proud that this bill does that, doubling the maximum Pell Grant amount to $9,000. 
   Beyond the sticker price of tuition, any student will tell you that the cost of textbooks is also a challenging cost they incur. The average student spends about $1,000 per year on textbooks, which is nearly 20 percent of tuition and fees at a 4-year public institution. Such high costs for textbooks can be the deciding factor which dashes or delays the dream of obtaining a college degree and a better life for many. 
   This legislation requires publishers to provide specific information about pricing so that faculty has full information when making purchasing decisions so students can help plan for expenses. 
   And in addition, Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to support an amendment offered by my colleague from Ohio, Congressman TIM RYAN, along with Representative Jason Altmire, which will create a pilot grant program to assist colleges in setting up textbook rental programs. These programs already exist in 25 schools, and a pilot test at Bowling Green State University in Ohio last spring saved 151 students $11,000. 
   We must also continue to strive to reduce the achievement gap in higher education between low-income and minority students and their peers. We can do this by ensuring that all students are prepared for the rigorous demands of higher learning. This bill strengthens the proven TRIO and GEAR UP college readiness and support programs for low-income and first generation students. I have seen firsthand, Mr. Speaker, the great things that these programs can do in Elyria in my district, which is a GEAR UP site, and the University of Akron, which has received TRIO funding. I look forward to the expansion of these proven programs so that more students in Ohio and around the country may benefit. 
   This legislation also addresses the disappointment we saw last year as the student loan scandal unfolded. Those financial aid directors that received kickbacks and payoffs and luxury gifts from private lenders exhibited a spectacular abuse of power and betrayal of the students they serve. This legislation cracks down on that abuse and restores accountability by requiring institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct and protect students from aggressive marketing by lenders. Institutions will also be required to provide students with information about Federal and private borrowing options. 
   This bill will also encourage and make it financially feasible for students to become public servants by authorizing up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness for military servicemembers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, first responders, nurses, educators, prosecutors, and public defenders. 
   This bill also continues the work this Congress has undertaken to support our troops by creating new scholarship and support programs for active duty military personnel, their family members, and veterans. It also establishes support centers to help veterans succeed in college and ensures fairness in student aid and housing aid for veterans to make it easier for them to go to college while also fulfilling their military service duties. 
   I'm also proud to support an amendment being offered by my colleague Congresswoman Susan Davis that is based on legislation of which I'm a cosponsor. Her amendment will prevent interest from accruing for active duty servicemembers and qualifying National Guard members for the duration of their activation up to 60 months when serving in a combat zone. 
   Mr. Speaker, the dream of a college education is moving further and further out of reach for middle- and low-income families. We need to put this prospect of a college education and a brighter future back in reach. Passing H.R. 4137 and building on the work we started last year is an important and priceless investment in the future of our children, our communities, and our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to take this opportunity to refresh the memory of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on past rules. 
   The last time the higher education reauthorization bill was considered in the House was just 2 years ago, in the 109th Congress. It, too, was done under a structured amendment process using two rules. Those two structured rules allowed a total of 22 amendments out of the 113 submitted, fewer than the rule we are offering today. 
   This is a very fair rule, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the bill. The rule makes in order 27 amendments on a wide variety of important issues relating to the higher education of our Nation's youth and others seeking a post-secondary education. Members on both sides of the aisle will be able to offer amendments that they believe will further improve this already very bipartisan bill. 
   This bill is one of the most bipartisan products of the 110th Congress, reported from the Education and Labor Committee by a vote of 45-0. There is no arguing with those facts. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, the benefits of higher education are undeniable for students, their families, and for our country and society at large. As a nation, we recognize this, having always been a global standard bearer and our high regard for the merits of higher education. Reaching the American Dream of leading a secure and fulfilling life is a goal that we can make achievable when we open the doors of college to all. 
   The fact that this bill passed 45-0 out of the Education Committee is a testament to the great work that the committee has done on this bill and to the fact that we care tremendously about the future of our children. 
   Listening to parents from my district, Mr. Speaker, and across the country, I hear about how the ability to send their children to college weighs on their minds. And talking to professors, counselors, and administrators at the University of Akron, Loraine County Community College, and other schools across Ohio, I also know that student debt is a tremendous factor in determining which professions our students are choosing to enter. 
   Nearly two-thirds of all students at 4-year colleges nationwide graduate with loan debt these days, with the average amount of debt surpassing $15,000. This bill we're passing goes a long way to changing that distressing fact. 
   By increasing aid and encouraging colleges to rein in tuition, this legislation will enable more students to pursue their passions and give back in service to their communities and our country. 
   I am proud that this bill continues the work of this New Direction Congress in making necessary improvements for the workforce of tomorrow. We have seen the necessity of investing in stem education, and this legislation continues the effort we began last year in passing the innovation agenda by improving teacher training and development programs and focusing on recruiting teachers into high-demand science and technology fields. 
   In today's global economy, it's essential that America's workforce remain competitive at an international level. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Higher Education Act has not been reauthorized in a decade. The Senate has already passed a reauthorization, so we must act expediently to pass this vital bill so the President may sign it into law. 
   I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in voting for this bill and supporting a brighter future for our students, our families, and our communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, as the hour grows late here this evening, I and some of my fellow freshmen colleagues have gathered here on the floor to talk about the issue that is overarching everything we do in this country today, the war in Iraq. 
   When we were elected in November, many of us came here on a mandate for change, a mandate for a change of direction in the way the country was heading and a mandate for change in direction in Iraq. So, tonight we are here to talk about the important events of this day, the action that this House took to pass a very important bill, the Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act, and also to talk about the report that was recently released from the White House on Iraq and the benchmarks that, sadly, are not being met. 
   With that, I would like to actually turn this discussion over to some of my fellow colleagues. We will begin with a statement and some commentary from the gentleman from New Hampshire, the distinguished gentleman from New Hampshire, Mr. Paul Hodes.

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Your points are well taken. After 4 1/2 years of this tragic war, more than 3,600 brave American troops killed, more than 26,000 injured, and nearly half a trillion dollars spent, we continue down the path that the President insists on taking us. 
   In his defiance, he has indicated he will continue to ignore reality, as well as the facts contained in the administration's own analysis of the war that was released today. 
   As you point out, in January, the President sent thousands of additional troops to Iraq and promised to hold the Iraqi government accountable for meeting those benchmarks for success. Today that report makes it clear that we need a change in course. 
   Unity in Iraq, we know here on this floor, must be determined by the people of Iraq, and our brave troops are caught in the crossfire of a sectarian civil war without a military mission, and the President has no plan to bring them home. 
   Instead of rejecting calls for change and demeaning those who seek it, the President should listen to the military experts, to Congress and the American people who in their will and wisdom want to responsibly redeploy the troops home. 
   With that, I would like to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri).

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman for his poignant remarks. Your point is well taken when you talk about the benchmarks and the target moving. How many more times will we hear this administration argue that we are just about to make progress? And yet here we are, 4 1/2 years later. 
   I would like to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).

   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), and the points raised are worth talking about. He's absolutely right when we talk about the loss of life, the irretrievable loss of life as being the real cost, the real measure of our loss. 
   Not too long ago during this surge, the escalation of this war, within this past 6 months, I had the very sad experience of I'm sure that many of you have had of going back to my district to go to visitation, to calling hours, for a fallen soldier. And on this occasion, I walked in and I was taken aback because family members, they thank you. They thank you for coming to pay your respects to this one who was willing to give it all for his country. 
   And as I walked in and I walked over to the casket where this brave soldier lay and there he was, this young man, and I kneeled down and I looked and I looked long and I looked hard because I wanted to remember and I wanted to feel all that I could so that when I came back here to cast the votes that we must cast and to make the decisions that we must make about the lives that are in our hands, to answer the questions about what we're willing to ask them to do and what we're willing to protect them from, I wanted that to be a part of who I am and the decisions I make. 
   So I carried that with me, and I carried it with me for the vote today, but I can't help but also share a very disappointing moment that happened later that day when I returned home, to hear the news and our President talking about how much he enjoyed riding his bike and how we should all ride our bikes because it's a healthy thing to do. Well, maybe so, but it struck me that this President, to my knowledge, doesn't go to many of those calling hours, and perhaps it would be different and perhaps the decision-making would be different because you're right, my colleague from Minnesota, the lives lost are irretrievable. 
   With that, I'd like to yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes), who has joined us again.

   Ms. SUTTON. It reminds me of a committee hearing yesterday, and we heard some discussion from one of the witnesses about courage. It was used in the context, you have to have the courage to go forward. Sometimes it takes courage to go forward. 
   I know that Mr. Arcuri and I together looked at each other, and thought sometimes it takes the courage that you spoke of, Mr. Hodes, to admit when things aren't going right and changing direction. That is the kind of direction that we need in this country from our President, that we need for our troops from our President.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 4 long years our country has endured a tragic war, a treacherous journey down a dark and winding path, with no clear routes, no clear destination and fatal hazards lurking around every blind corner. 
   Today I rise again with Chairman Skelton and my colleagues to act to clear the road ahead, to bring its end into the light. I rise again to push, to prod, to urge my colleagues to help us end the President's failed policy; to help us change the mission to a mission based in reality; to help us end the ravages that our brave soldiers who have performed so heroically, remove them from the crossfire in which they are caught, to remove them from the snipers' bullets and the life-ending IEDs. 
   I rise with the hope that those who have stood with the President and have given his Iraq policy a chance to succeed and another chance to succeed and another chance to succeed, that they will today choose a responsible change in direction based in reality that will establish a comprehensive and clear strategy for our role in Iraq. 
   Congress has allowed the President to lead our troops down this path for too long. It is time to demand accountability, to demand an exit strategy that is clear, and to demand an end to the injury and death that our brave soldiers face every day as they courageously proceed down this undefined road on which the President has placed them and they have dutifully traveled. 
   The President's ambling course has led our troops through the deadliest 3 months of the war in April, May and June of this year. During those three deadly months, 329 American soldiers died in Iraq. The cost of continuing down this path is too great. We must act to bring direction and accountability to the United States' mission for the sake of our troops and the families that love and support them. 
   It brings me great sadness to report that, since the war began in the spring of 2003, 163 brave men and women from Ohio have been killed. And 25 of those precious lives have been lost since the surge. The President's escalation of this war means six more grieving families in Ohio since when I last spoke in favor of the redeployment bill in May of this year. How many more times will we come to this floor to demand responsibility and accountability from our President? How many more families will be devastated by the loss of a loved one? How many more times will we hear the administration continue to argue that we are, quote, ``just about to make progress''? 
   Last November, the people of the 13th District of Ohio made their voices heard when they went to the polls. Their voices joined with the voices of people across this Nation. They voted for a change in direction, and today we act to give it to them.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, communities across this Nation are being devastated by home foreclosures, and my home State of Ohio has been particularly hard hit. This crisis has not stemmed from a single cause, and mitigating its effects will not be achieved with a single solution. Housing problems stem from predatory lending practices, job losses, and situations such as death, divorce and health emergencies. 
   It is important, Mr. Chairman, that we pursue innovative solutions to deal with this. This includes tying the provisions of Volunteerism and Service-Learning grants to programs that will serve areas that have been adversely affected by the mortgage crisis. This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to consider whether an area has a mortgage foreclosure rate greater than the national average when considering grant applications from States and other eligible entities. 
   In a time when so many of our communities are struggling, we need to pursue every avenue to make sure that the cities and towns with the greatest needs have access to the most assistance. 
   I urge a yes vote on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we heard with the last amendment, Ohio and many other States have suffered tremendous job losses in recent years. These workers and their families deserve our support, and they deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives. 
   Programs such as AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have done so much to provide opportunities for our youth and seniors. It is time now that we investigate ways to provide similar opportunities for Americans who have lost jobs through no fault of their own. 
   This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to conduct a study to identify specific areas of need for displaced workers and how existing programs and activities carried out under our national service laws can better serve displaced workers and communities affected by plant closings and job losses. The amendment also requires the Corporation to develop and carry out a pilot program based on the findings of the study. 
   Mr. Chairman, workers who have toiled for so long in manufacturing plants have much to offer their communities with their unique skill sets and leadership capabilities. I look forward to seeing how new service programs would reinvigorate America's displaced workforce with a sense of new purpose, so that they may continue to explore new career opportunities and continue contributing to our communities. 
   I urge a yes vote on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for those kind remarks and for yielding. 
   I thank you also not just for your leadership on behalf of the Members here, but I thank you for your leadership on this issue for the people that I represent, the good and fine folks of Northeast Ohio, from Lorraine to Akron to Barberton. This is so meaningful and so important, what we are doing here tonight and what we need to do, this Congress, to ensure that they have a better chance in this world. 
   It is crystal clear, not just from the discussion tonight but from what we see when we go home to our districts and we look across America, that our trade policies are not benefiting America's workers and America's businesses as they should. And there is a lot of angst and anger out there. People are really concerned. 
   The trade policies don't work for the average folks, but they also don't work, and I have to emphasize this, for American businesses as they should. 
   Working families in my congressional district in the State of Ohio and our Nation continue to face mounting job losses and a tumultuous economy. We have heard the numbers before, but they bear repeating. 
   Since 2000, we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs nationally. And, unfortunately, 200,000 of those jobs have been from my home State of Ohio. 
   Now, it is clear that Congress needs to act. When things aren't working, we should change direction. And that is why I am so proud of these new Members whom we have had the opportunity to hear from today and the leadership that they are exhibiting to take this Congress and this country into a direction that will work for the American people. We can't stand idly by and watch our jobs go overseas and our families suffer at home and our trade deficits soar. 
   I want to point out that I, like so many of the others who have spoken before, feel it is very important to say I am not opposed to trade. You know, sometimes when we start having discussions like this, people try to pit you into one category or another. They like to say you are either for trade or you are a protectionist. 
   Well, this is not a question about protectionism versus trade. This is a question about the rules of trade, and this is a question about what rules we think should be in a new trade model that will allow for trade to be engaged in fully and fairly by this country but require that others play by the same rules. 
   Trade can benefit American businesses and workers, and it can be a tool to help developing countries that are looking to access our markets. I hold out hope, and I hope it bears out, that I will have the opportunity in this Congress to vote for a trade agreement that lifts up our working families at home and abroad; a trade agreement that protects our environment at home and abroad; and a trade agreement that has strong and enforceable provisions, ensuring that all partners are playing by the same rules. 
   Now, we have heard some discussion about fast track already this evening. And my colleague Representative Braley and Congressman Michaud, you have identified this as such a critical issue coming up very quickly, set to expire in June. And I can tell you that, on behalf of those I represent in Northeast Ohio, I, for one, will not be supporting its renewal. 
   Fast track has been a raw deal for many American workers and businesses. Fast track takes away the accountability and oversight that Congress has been given under the Constitution to deal with trade. And, frankly, it has left us in a position with misguided and downright shameful trade policies that we have today. 
   If we had not had fast track, Congress could have been in a place to play a significant role in shaping the trade agreements while it still might have made a difference. The problem with fast track is, by the time it gets here, all we get to do is say whether we are going to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' for what is a bad trade deal. 
   We need to move in a new direction on trade. It is a moral imperative, and our fight begins with ending fast track. But there are other concerns that we have talked about on the trade horizon, such as the deals with Peru and Colombia and Panama. And these agreements, they have been modeled after the same flawed model that NAFTA gave us. And NAFTA was responsible for 50,000 jobs losses in Ohio. It is no longer hypothetical. We don't have to wonder what is going to happen with NAFTA. NAFTA has been a disaster for the people I represent and for this country. 
   So while we continue to get these harmful trade agreements forced down our throats, we have failed to address many of the trade problems we face with China and Japan and Korea and others. And while our trade deficits soar to the tune of a record $800 billion, which I have to tell you is not a record we should be happy with, with these nations, our wages in our Nation stagnate and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been displaced. 
   What is it about these failed trade policies that those who continue to push them don't understand? This is not acceptable, and we cannot allow this race to the bottom to continue.     
   I thank the gentleman very much for his leadership. I thank you on behalf of those I represent. I will continue to work with you as much as I possibly can to develop a new trade model, one that will work for American workers and businesses.

   Ms. SUTTON. Well, again, this is the way those who like what is going on with our trade deals, and those would be more or less the multinational companies who are very involved in helping to push them, whenever we start talking about this and the real impact and the real effects, they like to call you names like protectionist. 
   That is how they shut the debate down; but we can't allow that to happen, because, again, this is not a question of protectionism versus trade. It is a question about what are the rules of trade going to be. 
   We just have to keep saying that, because there are going to be voices out there that would like people to believe otherwise. But all we are talking about is what kind of rules of trade do we believe should be engaged in.

<DOCNO>Ms. SUTTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, throughout the course of history, when our Nation has faced its most significant debates over matters of war, there comes a time when voices of pundits and politicians must drop away and allow the voices of the people to be heard. 
   Our troops are brave and capable. They have fought heroically and this resolution makes it unequivocally clear that those of us who feel it incumbent to oppose the President's escalation nonetheless support our troops. All of us, and all Americans, support our troops. 
   But Congress also has an oversight responsibility to ensure that they are provided a mission based on a realistic assessment and an achievable goal before we ask them to risk life and limb to implement it. 
   The President has asked Congress to support his escalation plan to send another 20,000 troops to Iraq. 
   This war is now almost 4 years long. Congress has not spoken as loudly and as clearly as its responsibility requires. As the Representative of the 13th District of Ohio, I cannot sit silent. I oppose the President's plan for escalation and I fully support this resolution. 
   The President's own military commanders have advised against this course of action, and in November, my constituents and the American people voted for a change of direction in Iraq. Escalation is directly contradictory to that call for change. It takes us further down the wrong path, deeper and deeper, with a policy that asks our military to perform a nonmilitary mission of creating a unified government in Iraq. 
   But unity in Iraq has to be determined by the people who live there. It is neither fair nor just to ask our troops to fix a sectarian civil war. 
   Our Nation has paid a high price: the lives of 3,000 American troops lost; $379 billion spent, with another $8 billion every month of this war. 
   These lives cannot be retrieved; 139 brave men and women from Ohio have been killed, 14 from my district. I have a responsibility to every one of those casualties and to every one that might lie ahead, to represent their voices, especially those that can no longer be heard. 
   In early August 2005, Lance Corporal Edward ``Augie'' Schroeder II was killed in Iraq. Augie and 13 other young lives from Northeast Ohio were lost that day. In January 2006, Augie's father, Paul Schroeder, shared his thoughts and feelings in a letter to the Washington Post entitled, ``A Life Wasted.'' He said, ``Since August we have witnessed growing opposition to the Iraq war, but it is often whispered, hands covering mouths as if it is too dangerous to speak too loudly. Others discuss the never-ending cycle of death in places like Haditha in academic and sometimes clinical fashion, as in `the increasing lethality of improvised explosive devices.' '' 
   Wiping the clinical talk away, Paul Schroeder went on to share the painful reality that he and his family face, a reality that cannot be understood when sanitized by clinical terms. He said, ``Listen to the kinds of things that most Americans don't have to experience: The day Augie's unit returned from Iraq to Camp Lejeune we received a book of his notebooks, DVDs and clothes from his locker in Iraq. The day his unit returned home to waiting families, we received the second urn of ashes. This lad of promise, of easy charm and readiness to help, whose highest high was saving someone, using CPR as a First Aid squad volunteer, came home in one coffin and two urns. We buried him in three places that he loved, a fitting irony, I suppose, but just as rough each time.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the growing opposition to the war in Iraq must not be whispered, hands covering mouths as if it is too dangerous to speak too loudly. Accountability and oversight require more. This resolution rings loud and clear. We support our troops and we oppose the President's plan to escalate in Iraq. 
   Will the President hear our collective voice? If he does not, it will not be because we sat silent

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for his leadership on this important measure, and I thank Chairman Oberstar for his continued leadership in addressing our Nation's infrastructure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bill, and I also want to speak to an amendment that will be offered to this bill that is being cosponsored by our leader on this measure here on the floor, Representative MIKE ARCURI, and Representative MICHAEL CONAWAY. This will help to bring an important sense of Congress to this bill. We share a common vision for a solution to prevent future disasters by addressing a critical need at the onset of a bridge project. I strongly support this bipartisan amendment, which will express a sense of Congress that those requesting Federal funds for bridge projects present corrosion mitigation and prevention plans. 
   Corrosion mitigation and prevention is essential to extend the life of our Nation's critical infrastructure and save taxpayers money. In 2002 the Federal Highway Administration reported the cost of corrosion to our highway bridges at $8.3 billion each year. As we unfortunately learned when the I-35 bridge in Minneapolis collapsed last August, investing in our Nation's infrastructure is no longer a theoretical argument. By utilizing experts trained in corrosion prevention, we will be reducing future maintenance costs and increasing public safety at the same time. 
   The University of Akron in my district understands this critical need and is creating the first comprehensive corrosion engineering and science program in the United States. Their corrosion engineering program will train and prepare experts in the field, creating high-earning engineering jobs by addressing a critically important issue. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment and on the rule and on the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SUTTON. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here on the floor this evening during Hispanic Heritage Month to honor the Hispanic community and pay tribute to the extraordinary contributions that Hispanics have made and continue to make to our great Nation. 
   There are 45.5 million Hispanics in America whose hard work, strong faith and closely knit families have made America a better and stronger country. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor some of the Hispanic leaders in my congressional district who selflessly serve our communities with diligence and passion. 
   Leaders including Joel Arredondo, president of the Lorain City Council and president of the Coalition of Hispanic Issues in Progress. Joel is an active leader in our community, and as a result, last year the Lorain County Urban League honored him as the Community Leader of the Year. 
   Pastor Gilbert Silva is the pastor at House of Praise in Lorain, Ohio. Pastor Silva has touched the lives of many people through his thoughtful sermons and one-on-one interaction with his parishioners. 
   Celestino Rivera, chief of police for the City of Lorain. Chief Rivera serves in his position with professionalism and integrity in his mission to protect and serve our community. 
   First Sergeant Sam Obechi teaches the Honor Guard at the Southview School Army Junior ROTC. Not only has Sergeant Obechi selflessly served our country, he serves our community and our Nation by teaching young men and women how to prepare for college and the Armed Services. 
   Victor Leandry, director of El Centro Social Services, which is a regional affiliate for the National Council of La Raza. His commitment to the community is seen through his work in civil rights, social justice, community development, and education. 
   Nellie Carraballo is a member of Steelworkers Local 1104. I had the honor of serving on a panel with Nellie recently to discuss the so-called U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Nellie has helped educate many in my community by sharing the worker's rights violations that she witnessed while she was on a trip to Colombia. 
   Laura Rios, director of a community grassroots organization in my district called Reclaim Lorain. Laura and her group have energized the community through their local initiatives, such as their campaign encouraging people to vote.  
   Mr. Speaker, the individuals that I have mentioned are only a few of the very many Hispanic leaders in Ohio and across our country who are fighting to improve our community and our neighborhoods. 
   The Hispanic community is a vital part of our Nation economically, culturally and politically, and the 110th Democratic Congress has been successful in enacting key initiatives to help revitalize our economy and renew the American Dream for millions of America's Hispanic families. 
   We increased the minimum wage, benefiting 2.3 million Hispanics over the next several years, the first increase in a decade. 
   We have twice passed legislation to provide health care coverage for 10 million children in need, including millions of Hispanic children. Now, unfortunately, President Bush vetoed these measures, preventing children from accessing the health care that they need. 
   But in addition, this Congress has extended unemployment benefits at a time when the Hispanic unemployment rate stands at 8 percent. 
   Finally, this Congress has passed landmark measures to improve the lives of America's veterans, including the 1.1 million veterans who are Hispanic. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that Congress continue to focus on expanding economic opportunities for our Hispanic working families and communities. 
   I will continue to fight to ensure that Hispanics in my district have a voice in Washington, D.C., and once again, I'm proud to recognize our Hispanic leaders in my district in Ohio and all across our great Nation. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and recognize all of the accomplishments of the Hispanic community.

   The effects of these damaging trade policies are no longer theoretical; they are real. We need a truly new trade model that addresses the concerns raised by the American people in the last election. Congress must reclaim its constitutional authority over trade. 
   We must have s trong and enforceable standards in our trade agreement. We must address the ever-evolving unfair trade practices used by foreign governments to protect their markets, such as currency manipulation, illegal subsidies and product dumping. We must replace policies that reward businesses for outsourcing jobs with incentives and sensible tax policies that will help our businesses and workers. 
   We need a new trade model now.
