<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This legislation extends the TRIA program for 15 years, and it is vital to our Nation. 
   A longer TRIA means economic certainty and stability in commercial real estate. A longer TRIA means better planning, better rates, and better returns for investors. A longer TRIA is good for the economy. 
   Financing for major construction often takes more than 10 years. If a project seeks finance for a project in year one of the new TRIA, investors might have the confidence to advance these funds. However, if a project is conceived in year two or year three, and if TRIA is extended for only 10 years, then investors will know that TRIA will be around for only 7 years. The investors may not provide the necessary capital, or those investors may change far more interest than they would under TRIA. 
   What happens if a community cannot rebuild after an act of terror? Jobs are lost and with them tax revenue from the local to the state and to the federal level. It simply is not rational to believe that somehow a limited TRIA will save money in the long run. 
   I simply do not believe that the reinsurance industry has the ability or the interest in providing terrorism risk insurance. A federal backup like TRIA is essential. 
   My colleagues need to remember that TRIA is not a handout and it is not a benefit. The program pays out only in the event of an act of terrorism against the United States; and terrorism is neither a benefit nor a handout. 
   When one part of America is attacked, the entire country is attacked. When one city or region suffers, then the rest of the country pitches in to help. We have done that in the past after earthquakes, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and acts of terror. 
   I hope that none of you have to experience what the people of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut experienced 6 years ago. The next attack may occur in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, or even small cities across this Nation. The people and the government will respond, as we have in the past. 
   But, TRIA ensures that taxpayers will not have to bear the entire burden of the response. The bill requires insurance companies to do what they do best: provide insurance. Without TRIA, the American taxpayers will have to bear the entire cost of responding to another act of terrorism. 
   I fully support the TRIA legislation brought before the House today and urge my colleagues to pass the legislation and allow for Senate Action.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (OMAHA MALL SHOOTING -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a very heavy heart. Yesterday, our Nation witnessed yet another act of gun violence, this time at a mall in Omaha, Nebraska. I know my colleagues from Nebraska are going to be talking about this later. My hearts go out to them for the people that they represented. Eight people were murdered in the rampage. Five others were wounded, two critical. These victims did nothing wrong to deserve their fate. They were mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. They were just trying to do their shopping, and many of them were working at the mall. But the actions of a crazed gunman changed that in a matter of seconds. 
   Yesterday's shootings was a terrible tragedy. But unfortunately events like this happen almost every day. Every year we lose over 30,000 people to gun violence. Take a second to think about that. Every year, 30,000 victims. I have been here for 11 years. That is 330,000 people that have been killed because of gun violence while I was in Congress. When you want to put that in perspective, that is the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three hundred and thirty thousand victims. 
   When you think about it, what these families are going to be going through in the months ahead with the holidays coming, the pain they are going to be facing, the community, the pain they are going to be facing, I know a lot about that. Tomorrow is December 7. December 7. It was 14 years ago that we had the Long Island Railroad massacre. On that particular day, six people died, one of them my husband. On that day, 19 people were injured, my son critically. Fourteen years later, he is still suffering from that. 
   We, as a Nation, have to start looking how are we going to have this dialogue? I have never tried to do anything to take away the right of someone legally to be able to own a gun, and yet because of the way the laws are in this country and the way we do things backhandedly in this country, it is so easy to get guns. If you want to talk about what the health care costs are, it is over $100 billion a year the health care costs for those that survive these kind of incidents. 
   Think what we could do with that money. Maybe we could educate our young people and reach out to them a little bit better so they don't go into the world of violence. Maybe they won't join gangs. Maybe a good mental health program for this Nation so those like the gunman wouldn't have fallen through the cracks and gotten the help that he needed. 
   We, as a Nation, on a daily basis, face inconveniences. Tonight when I fly to go home, I will be getting on a plane. I am going to be going through security, all in the name of security and safety. When you go to get your driver's license, long lines. We do this for security and safety. It is an inconvenience. Getting a passport today is an inconvenience. Can't we serve a little bit of inconvenience and come together to make sure that those that are getting guns have the right to have a gun by passing background checks? Can't we make sure with a little inconvenience that we don't make it so easy for these  guns to float throughout our cities and come into some of our cities illegally? We cannot save everybody. I understand that. But think about if we could cut it down to maybe just 15,000 people a year dying. As far as I am concerned, one person dying is one too many. 
   I promised my son as he was recovering many years ago that I would do whatever I could to prevent another family from not going through what our families did. And here it is 11 years later. Here we had a terrible tragedy yesterday in Nebraska. Not long ago, we had a terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech. Before that, we had another terrible tragedy at another mall in the Midwest. We can think about all these terrible tragedies that are happening more and more not just in our inner cities now but in places in our country that we never thought we would ever see gun violence. 
   This Nation needs to decide what it is going to do to stop this rampage of unnecessary killings of innocent people. Three hundred thirty thousand people killed in the 11 years I have been here, I hope we can do better. I pray for the families. I pray for the communities.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I want to call attention to the fact that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, as first declared by Congress in 1998, and I also would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for bringing this forward through the Education Committee. 
   Throughout October, thousands of groups hold events to bring awareness to the violence that affects millions of men, women and children in our country every single year. The positive effect of this advocacy has increased community awareness about domestic violence. 
   Increased knowledge about domestic violence and the services available helps victims seek help, holds abusers accountable, and helps children live in homes where violence is not condoned. In addition to recognizing October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our Congress has recognized that domestic violence is a serious crime by passing laws such as the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, the Victims of Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Preventing domestic violence is critical in addressing and breaking the cycle of violence. And it is a cycle. Whether the violence is found in a dating situation or in married life, the strongest risk factor of violent behavior continuing from one generation to the next is if children are witnessing this violence. Evidence shows that children who witness domestic violence at home are more likely to engage in violent behavior, do poorly in school, use drugs and alcohol, and at an early age engage in risky sexual behavior and develop mental illness issues. 
   Domestic violence adversely affects the workplace by negatively impacting the victim's health and safety, decreasing employee productivity, and increasing health care costs.

   Again, domestic violence is like a domino effect. Once it happens in the family, it continues through generation through generation. 
   The last speaker mentioned about the community getting involved, people getting involved. We have to stop this because it's a terrible, terrible action against people.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Shuster for their work on this bill. 
   My district is located in a densely populated area on Long Island, New York. We are fortunate to have the comfort and convenience of rail transportation to New York City and around Long Island by the Long Island Railroad. 
   The Long Island Railroad moves safely through the Fourth Congressional District with the use of horns at train crossings. Although train horns are necessary to ensure the safety at railroad crossings, the noise can significantly affect families and communities surrounding these railroad crossings. 
   While we can still all agree that train horns are necessary to ensure the safety of residents at railroad stations and crossings, the sounding of train horns day and night seriously impacts the quality of life of many in my communities in Long Island. 
   I support the Federal Railroad Administration and its primary goal of ensuring the safety of railroads and trains across the country and in the Fourth Congressional District in New York. I do not, and will not support any measure that will reduce the safety of railroads and trains moving through our communities. 
   With that in mind, I also understand the effect that locomotive horn noise has on the quality of life of my constituents. Over the years, I have been contacted by constituents who have complained that the volume of the train noise is so severe that many of them lose their sleep, even with earplugs. 
   Trains on Long Island can run literally around the clock. Residents complain of several minutes of constant horn noise as the train travels through many of my communities such as Valley Stream, East Rockaway and Cedarhurst, Long Island. 
   When trains are nearby, the volume is so high that people are forced to stop their conversations, and teachers at nearby schools are forced to stop teaching their students. 
   Rail traffic through many communities in this country is an unavoidable reality as to the use of train horns. However, we have an obligation to ensure that we do everything possible to maintain the quality of life for communities near railroad tracks. 
   That is why I've introduced an amendment to ask that the Secretary research the development and use of train horn technology with an emphasis on reducing train horn noise and its effect on a community. This will ensure that, as we move forward and continue to expand our railroad infrastructure in this country, we will also continue to address the concerns of the communities surrounding the infrastructure. 
   Thank you, Chairman Oberstar, for continuing to work with me on this issue that is so important to my constituents. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NATIONAL STEM SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would like to thank my colleague from the Education Committee, Congressman Holt, for bringing this measure to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1051, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship Database Act. This legislation will help students become more competitive in science and math and allow them to find the scholarship that is right for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the audience today we have many young students. This is the future of this country. And we have to do everything that we can to encourage our young people to go into the sciences, math, and engineering. Last year the Education Committee went to China and we spoke with many students there and the minister of education. And their effort, and certainly on what they are pushing their young people to do, is to go into the math and sciences. 
   This country has an obligation to give our young people the ability to compete in the future. This kind of legislation is going to help in so many ways as far as our country on our economy. But more than that, our young people deserve this opportunity. 
   When you think back to the 1960s when we were looking at the moon and having programs that were putting us into space, those were kids' dreams. We need to reunite that dream, to have people understand that engineering and math is exciting. The last several years Mr. Holt and Mr. Ehlers have been talking about science and math in our committee; so it is right that at this time we are pushing to encourage our young people, saying if these are the careers that you want to go into, we are going to help you between a private partnership and certainly with the government's helping. This is a great piece of legislation. We should be seeing more and more of this. This is only the beginning. 
   And I have to say last week I had a field hearing back in my district, and the issue had to do with gangs. And we had testimony from all the experts. But even those young people that had gotten into gangs, all they were asking for were opportunities to better themselves. This young fellow did go back to college. He did start studying science and math, and now he is reaching out. Education is the most important thing that we can do for our young people and for this country. 
   So, again, I thank my colleague Mr. Holt for bringing this, and I encourage certainly all of my colleagues to support this legislation H.R. 1051. This is only the beginning. We must do more things like this.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) for introducing this resolution and for the work he has done. 
   This month is recognized as National Community College Month. Community colleges represent much of what is great about America. Diverse, dynamic and innovative, open and inclusive, they are one of America's greatest inventions. 
   The first community college, Joliet Junior College, opened its doors almost 100 years ago in Illinois. It was one of the many that sprung up in the early 20th century amid worries that America could not remain competitive without a better educated workforce. 
   Policymakers and educators sensed that one of the barriers keeping students from keeping their education was that they were unable or unwilling to leave home. And so a network of community colleges was set up to encourage more students to earn college degrees or obtain specialized training. Today, over 11 million students are enrolled in America's 1,200 community colleges. 
   Community colleges educate over half of the country's undergraduate students. Community college open enrollment policies mean that they welcome all students regardless of wealth, heritage, or previous academic experience. As a result, community colleges are more diverse in terms of age, income, race and ethnicity than traditional colleges and universities. They enroll students from all over the world. 
   About 40 percent of all international undergraduates in the United States attend our community colleges. By bringing people from all walks of life together to learn from one another, these schools enrich and enhance our communities. 
   Community colleges educate over half of the new nurses and 65 percent of new health care workers. They are also responsible for the education of 50 percent of teachers and close to 85 percent of our emergency responders. 
   Community colleges retrain workers who have lost their jobs, those looking to change fields mid-career or reenter the workforce after an extended absence, and high school students hoping to get a head start on college credit or take a course not offered in the regular curriculum. 
   Because of all that they have done for this country, on this day we would like to thank our Nation's community colleges and recognize the dedication of their facilities and staff for helping to educate our Nation's students. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEAS OF A NATIONAL CHILD CARE WORTHY WAGE DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, on May 1 of each year, child care providers and other early childhood professionals nationwide conduct awareness and education efforts highlighting the importance of good early childhood education for our Nation's young children. 
   In support of these actions, I have introduced H. Con. Res. 112, a bipartisan resolution in support of National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. This resolution is an effort to support these initiatives and to help develop greater public awareness in this area. Every day, approximately 13 million children are cared for outside the home so that their parents can work, including some who work in our congressional offices. 
   The committed individuals who nurture and teach these young children are undervalued, despite their important work. We know that children begin to learn at birth, and that the quality of care they receive will affect their language, development, math skills, behavior and general readiness for school. However, the inadequate level of wages for child care staff, roughly $18,000 a year, has led to difficulties in attracting and retaining high quality early childhood caretakers and educators. 
   In addition to low wages, less than one-third of child care workers have health insurance, and even fewer have pensions. As a result, the turnover rate for child care providers is 30 percent a year. This high turnover rate interrupts consistent and stable relations that children need to have with their caregivers. 
   Please join me in recognizing the important work of child care providers and support the efforts to provide them with a worthy wage. The Nation's child care workforce and the families that depend on them deserve our support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

But I think that this Nation really has to start looking at how we prepare, certainly for the few future and for the global economy that we are all facing. Certainly having high-qualified teachers, day care workers to make sure that our children are getting the best education they possibly can at the earliest age possible. We look at the other countries and see what they are doing. I have to say that many times we are shortchanging our children.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Stearns for introducing this resolution. I rise in support of House Resolution 298, a bill to commend the University of Florida Gators for their historical win in the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. 
   On April 22 the Florida Gators defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 84-75 in the final game of the Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. The Gators became the first team since 1992 to win back-to-back national titles and just the seventh school ever to be repeat champions. 
   They were also the first team in history to complete this feat with the same starting lineup. The University of Florida's athletic program has proven to be one of the best in the Nation, now having won 21 national championships in all sports combined. They are the only program to hold both football and men's basketball championships at the same time, and the first school in NCAA history to hold both the basketball and football championship titles in the same calendar year. 
   The Gators' basketball team was led by their great coach, Billy Donovan, who became the 12th coach to win multiple basketball championships and one of four active coaches to win multiple titles. On top of that, Donovan became the third youngest coach to win more than one NCAA title. Coach Donovan is also a native of the Fourth Congressional District, originally hailing from Rockville Centre, in my district on Long Island. 
   The Gators finished their season with an impressive record of 35-5, winning the final 10 games of the season. Every player, coach, trainer, manager and staff member of the University of Florida Gators dedicated this season and their efforts to the common goal of repeating as men's NCAA basketball champions, and did so with class and sportsmanship. 
   I urge my colleagues to show their support for the Florida Gators and vote for House Resolution 298. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Boustany for introducing this resolution to honor National Charter School Week. He has been the sponsor of this resolution for the past 3 years, and we appreciate his leadership on this issue. 
   Charter schools across the country are marking this occasion by opening their doors to the community and inviting them to learn about the role of charter schools in public education. With over 3,600 charter schools educating nearly 1.1 million children, charter schools have changed the landscape of public education. Almost 250 schools are created each year. Committed parents and students and community leaders have led the way, creating charter schools to meet the needs of the local community. 
   Charter schools are free from regulations but not accountability. There are model charter schools that are producing good outcomes for their students. The public school system in this country continues to generate innovative strategies for educating all children. Quality charter schools represent one model for this innovation. 
   On the occasion of National Charter School Week, I want to commend the 90,000 public schools in this country that are working hard to provide opportunity for children across the country. I urge my colleagues to support our Nation's charter schools and to vote for this resolution.

   Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote in favor of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007 to fully fund our troops and end the war in Iraq. 
   This legislation will fully fund the troops serving in Iraq. It is imperative that they have the necessary equipment to conduct their mission as safely and swiftly as possible. 
   Today's vote marks a major shift in the strategy for Iraq by imposing real responsibility on the Iraqi government. President Bush outlined several benchmarks for the Iraqi government in his January 10 address. Unfortunately, there were no real consequences for the Iraqi government if these benchmarks were not met. Today's vote put real pressure on Prime Minister Maliki and the Iraqi government to meet these benchmarks. If the Iraqis do not step up and take control of their own security, U.S. forces will begin a phased redeployment as early as July 1, 2007. All U.S. troops must begin their redeployment by March 1, 2008, by which time, the Iraqis will have had ample opportunity to be trained and take control of their situation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, as you have heard our colleagues coming down to the well and talking passionately on the anniversary of the Iraq war and the debate that will go later on in this week and a vote that will come on to the floor of the House, I think that this is what certainly the American people want to see; but tonight, Mr. Speaker, I also want to talk about something else. 
   We in Congress must keep our eyes and ears open on all things that are happening around us; and today I want to talk about the tens of thousands of Federal Aviation Administration employees that are working without a contract. 
   Most of these workers are represented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, Professional Airways System Specialist, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
   The FAA under the Bush administration has attacked the collective bargaining process. The FAA has not implemented a single negotiated and ratified contract with any of its contract unions. FAA employees need a fair collective bargaining process restored. 
   Just as this House gave collective bargaining rights to TSA employees in the 9/11 bill, which was the right thing to do, we must do no less for the employees of the FAA. Let me be very clear on this point. Our air traffic controllers do not have a contract with the FAA. 
   The FAA imposed work and pay rules on these individuals last September. There is no Federal law that recognizes imposed work and pay rules as a contract. Morale among FAA employees is extremely low. Retirements are far exceeding FAA's planning. Fatigue among those employees who remain is a major concern, and these are all direct effects of the unilaterally imposed work rules. 
   In 2003, there were over 15,000 air traffic controllers. At the end of 2006, there were barely 14,000. Of the 14,000 working today, almost 2,000 of them are trainees and not fully certified. At the same time, and by no means by coincidence, operational errors are on the rise at the FAA's busiest facilities, including Atlanta-Hartsfield and the Southern California TRAY-CON. 
   Current FAA projections are that by the year 2010, which is only a few years away, 40 percent of the air traffic control workforce will have 4 years or less on the job. 
   This House has a duty to these individuals to a fair process. That is all they are asking for, nothing more, nothing less. 
   Mr. Speaker, a lot of people do not understand the job that air traffic controllers have, yet they have the control of the thousands and thousand of lives on a daily basis. Every single day that people fly, it is the air traffic controllers that are basically controlling the skies to make us safe. 
   And being that we are talking about 9/11, think about what our air traffic controllers did on that day. They brought down thousands and thousands of planes without one incident. They saved so many lives, and yet here the administration is taking away the right for them to earn a decent pay. 
   The pressure that is up in those towers is unbelievable. I have spent time there just to see what that job was like. They are not asking for more or less. All they are asking for is a contract. 
   This House has a duty to make sure that those workers have what is due them.

   I would like to thank some of my colleagues who have been instrumental in getting this legislation to the floor today. Chairman Skelton of the Armed Services has done a tremendous job. We were under a lot of pressure to try and have the bill on the floor today, and I appreciate everything that he has done. Also, my good friend Congresswoman Nancy Boyda and Congressman Joe Wilson have been great friends to the glider pilots, and I thank you both for the issues that you have been fighting for. 
   We are here today to honor the glider pilots of the World War II. Glider planes were lightweight aircraft without engines that were used to drop supplies and reinforcement personnel for troops and surveillance. They were effective because they made no noise, and they could fly into enemy areas undetected. 
   The gliders would be towed by larger planes in order to take off, but then would fly and land on their own. The glider pilots flew dangerous missions and were constantly at risk of being shot down. 
   We have heard in the past that some of these pilots that volunteered to be glider pilots were suicidal. They were not. They wanted to fly, and they wanted to be part of protecting this Nation. So they became glider pilots because that was the only way they were going to get into the air at that particular time. 
   Glider pilots were instrumental in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, despite the fact that pilots had to improvise where to land, since no appropriate landing strips were known to be behind enemy lines. Later in the war, Germans would plant wooden poles in open fields to prevent glider pilots from landing.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. It is so important for those that are watching this when you have veterans out there. We have the oral history of our veterans that is going to the Library of Congress. I know projects that I have been doing back home, we have been working with an awful lot of veterans who were prisoners of war, because what you said earlier is so true. 
   Veterans need to be remembered for everything that they have done for this Nation, but certainly there are so many veterans out there that are not honored. I just wanted to say that with your words and talking about your father, and I know that our colleague here probably wants to talk about her dad, who was also in the war. 
   With that, I really appreciate your words, and I really think that all of us should be encouraging our veterans to talk about their experiences so the younger generation does know about it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in full support of passage of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. 
   I worked with Chairman Miller and Mr. Sarbanes, the sponsor of the bill and a member of my subcommittee which has jurisdiction over environmental education. 
   It is a pleasure to support the professional development of environmental educators and expand the capacity of these teachers and the States in which they work to bring environmental education to our Nation's young people through this bill. 
   The No Child Left Inside Act seeks to improve the professional development opportunities of our Nation's environmental educators. We know that teachers make the difference in the educational experience of young people and their educational outcomes. By creating professional development opportunities that are meaningful and relevant for our teachers, they in turn will make environmental education meaningful and relevant for their students. These students evolve into the voting citizens who will craft our Nation's future. The bill contributes to ensuring a scientifically literate society through ensuring a more scientifically literate teaching force. 
   The National Academies of Science recently released a report titled ``Public Participation in Environmental Assessment and Decision Making.'' The first conclusion states that ``When done well, public participation improves the quality and legitimacy of a decision and builds the capacity of all involved to engage in the policy process. It can lead to better results in terms of environmental quality and other social objectives. It also can enhance trust and understanding among parties. Achieving these results depends on using practices that address difficulties that specific aspects of the context can present.'' 
   This is a description of democracy at work. 
   It is important to ensure that our society is scientifically literate and therefore capable of not only understanding, but critically assessing, scientific data and weighing the societal consequences of these decisions. Science education is critical for the future of our Nation. So many of the skills taught and utilized in science are used and necessary for success in the global knowledge economy. We know that students learn so much and may even be more inspired when presented with opportunities outside the classroom and programs like these are often what sparks a student's interest in science. H.R. 3036 has a role here. 
   Beyond professional development, the bill contains a grant program to make environmental education more effective and more widely practiced. These grants will have local, regional, and national impact, and will increase the number of young people who understand the importance of the environment and our interaction with it. To keep American competitive and number one, we must have a scientifically literate society, and H.R. 3036 works to ensure this. I ask my colleagues to join me in a yes vote on this bill.

We are going to make sure that those CEOs don't get those large golden parachutes. We are going to make sure that those people who are going through foreclosures are going to be protected. These are the things we are going to be working on. 
   Today is not the end of all days. Today is the beginning of getting legislation passed so that we can protect the American people even more, so this does not happen again.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H. Res. 951, a resolution condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians, and for other purposes. I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this resolution and helped gather support for its consideration on the House floor today. 
   This resolution is very timely as Israel faces new and increasing threats to its security. Palestinian rockets have been fired from Gaza and hit Israeli communities on an almost daily basis. More than 200,000 Israeli citizens are within range of these Palestinian rockets. 
   In 2005, as part of an effort to move the peace process forward, Israel removed all of its civilian and military personnel from the Gaza Strip. There was hope that a Palestinian state could emerge and co-exist peacefully alongside Israel. However, Hamas has taken control and instead of working toward peace and efforts to improve the lives of the Palestinians, has decided to inflict terror upon Israel. In recent weeks, the Israeli communities of Sderot and Ashkelon have been especially hard-hit, resulting in numerous casualties and psychological trauma to its citizens. 
   Furthermore, just this week, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Security Council that Hizbullah has 30,000 rockets in southern Lebanon--10,000 of the rockets are long-range and 20,000 are short-range. Israel faces many threats on multiple fronts. 
   The resolution before us appropriately condemns the rocket attacks on Israeli citizens and supports the right of the Israeli government to stop the rocket attacks on its citizens. While Israel has shown restraint in dealing with the Palestinians, along with a willingness to work towards peace, the Israeli citizens who are under attack are looking toward their government to protect them. We must support the efforts of the Israeli government to keep its people safe. 
   I am grateful that we have the opportunity to consider this resolution on the House floor and send a strong message that attacks against Israeli citizens are not acceptable. Israel is one of America's closest allies and we must do all that we can to ensure the security of the state of Israel and its people. Terrorism is not acceptable here and is not acceptable around the world. Americans, Israelis, and others should be free to live their lives without fear of being attacked. Children should be able to go to school and not have to worry about a Palestinian rocket attack. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for safety and security and send a message to the International community. Pass H. Res. 951.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, next week we'll be celebrating the 6th anniversary of the terrible attacks that happened on September 11 in New York, here in the Washington area, the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. 
   While we remember those that we lost, I hope that we also reflect on how our Nation, and especially this Congress, came together during the weeks and months that followed that terrible, terrible day. 
   Following 9/11, we, as Americans, demonstrated the best of all of us. Thousands volunteered to help with the rescue and recovery efforts on Ground Zero. Scores more donated money, gave blood, took time to help people that they didn't even know. Millions prayed for the families of those that lost loved ones. It was a remarkable time. People from all walks of life stood together with a renewed sense of purpose and compassion. 
   While we remember those we lost on this anniversary of September 11, let's also remember how we came together to help get America through perhaps the most difficult time in our history. Let's remember the firefighters, the police officers, the union workers who risked their lives to save others. Let's remember the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, who became advocates for commonsense laws down here in Washington that would prevent another tragedy from happening. These courageous men and women worked tirelessly so that other families wouldn't experience what they went through. 
   As each year passes, the needs of those affected by 9/11 change. We work with a number of families back on Long Island in my district, especially the children, that still need mental health care. We need to improve the health care for the recovery workers who put their lives on the line and are now suffering from illnesses. And local residents, it is still paramount in our minds to make sure that they stay healthy. 
   The long-term mental health of families and children who lost loved ones maintains its high importance. Most people will remember it as being post-traumatic syndrome. One never knows when those flashes of that day come back. Sometimes it takes years and years for the treatment to take hold. 
   The Fourth Congressional District, I want to salute such groups as the South Nassau Communities Hospital and the World Trade Center Family Center that have been working hard to address the mental health needs of the children affected by 9/11 and have made great progress in helping them cope with this horrible tragedy. 
   In my office, I have a painting that was done several years ago by a young child on how they saw the world. And through therapy, you can now see the paintings have improved with the sun shining, meaning the young child is getting on with their life. Their work is equally as important as the search and recovery efforts following the attacks, and I commend them for it.  
   On September 11, 2001, our hearts were broken, but our spirits grew stronger. On September 11, 2007, I can think of no better memorial to those we lost on 9/11 than making their children and grandchildren's world a better place. 
   Some will say time has passed and it's time to move on with their lives. I have worked with many of those 9/11 families, and they have moved on with their lives. But again, through every great tragedy one never knows when you'll break down and cry because you remember something. 
   Every American remembers September 11, the year 2001. Every American knows where they were that day. Every American came together to make sure that those that needed help would have it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the American people for standing together. I thank those that lost their lives to save other lives and, hopefully, we will never forget those that made the great sacrifices who still need our help. September 11 will be in everybody's minds forever in history. Let us not, here in this Congress, forget those that have survived but still need our help to get them through the illnesses they are facing.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (HISTORIC INCREASES IN VETERANS FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, for far too long our veterans have been left behind. In fact, last year the Republican Congress and the Bush administration proposed cutting funding for the operation and maintenance of veterans' medical facilities by $464 million. Earlier this year, we saw the effects of these budget cuts manifested in the conditions of Walter Reed Hospital and other VA hospitals across the country. 
   Fortunately, this new Democratic Congress has a different set of priorities. We allocate the largest increase in funding for veterans health care in history, and we do it in a fiscally responsible way that does not produce budget deficits down the line. 
   The 2008 MILCON and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill includes $70 million more than the President requested for veterans substance abuse programs, $69 million more than he requested for medical and prosthetic research, and $127 million more to address the 400,000-deep backlog of veterans benefits claims. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are finally keeping our promise to our veterans, not only to the veterans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today, but all veterans.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NICS IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I thank you, Mr. Conyers, for yielding. I want to thank you for your leadership on these issues, and I appreciate the time. 
   I would like to thank my good friend, Congressman Dingell, for all the hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. Without his help, we would not be debating this bill today. 
   I also would like to thank Mr. Boucher, the original cosponsor and I would also like to say think you to Mr. LAMAR SMITH for working with us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is deeply flawed. Millions of criminals' records are not accessible by NICS, and millions of others are missing critical data, such as arrest dispositions, due to data backlogs. 
   The primary cause of delay in NICS background checks is the lack of updates due to funding and technology  issues in the States. Many States have not automated the records concerning mental illness, restraining orders or misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence. Simply put, the NICS system must be updated on both the State and the Federal level. 
   On March 12, 2002, a senseless shooting took the lives of a priest and a parishioner, Mrs. Tosner, at the Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York. That is part of my district. 
   This shooting brought attention to the need to improve information sharing, and it would allow and enable Federal and State enforcement agencies to conduct a complete background check on a potential firearm purchaser. The man who committed this double murder had a prior disqualifying mental health commitment and a restraining order against him, but passed a Brady background check because NICS did not have the necessary information to determine that he was ineligible to purchase a firearm under Federal or State law. 
   This same scenario happens every day. The shooter in the Virginia Tech massacre was prohibited from purchasing a firearm. 
   Unfortunately, flaws in the NICS system allowed his records to slip through the cracks. He was able to purchase two handguns and use them to brutally murder 32 individuals. 
   Today, Congress will stand up for the victims and pass commonsense legislation. According to a Third Way report, over 91 percent of those adjudicated for mental illness cannot be stopped by a background check due to flaws in the system. But this issue allows other barred individuals to purchase firearms. Twenty-five percent of felony convictions do not make it into the NICS system. That is why I introduced the NICS Improvement Act with Mr. Dingell. 
   My bill will require all States to provide the NICS system with the relevant records needed to conduct effective background checks. It's the State's responsibility to ensure that this information is current and accurate. They must update the records to ensure that violent criminals do not have the right to own firearms. 
   However, I recognize many State budgets are already overburdened. This legislation would provide grants to States to update their records into the NICS system. States would get the funds they need to make sure records relevant to the NICS are up to date. 
   While the NICS system does have major flaws, it is responsible for preventing thousands of barred individuals from purchasing firearms. Approximately 916,000 individuals have been prohibited from purchasing a firearm for failing a background check between November 30, 1998, when the NICS system began operating on December 31 of 2004. 
   During this same period, nearly 49 million Brady background checks were processed through the NICS system. By improving upon the system, we can stop criminals from falling between the cracks. Today we are one step closer to bringing the records of millions of barred individuals into the NICS system. No system will be perfect, but that does not mean we should not make improvements to make it better. This is good policy that will save lives and should be passed by the House. 
   My legislation imposes no new restrictions on gun owners and does not infringe on the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. 
   I also would like to thank Bob Dobek of my staff and Josh Tzuker of Mr. Dingell's staff for the tireless hours they put in to have this bill brought to the floor. This policy crosses party lines, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2640.     
   I think the most important thing that we must all remember, we have an opportunity to save lives. That is why I came to Congress. This has been a long, long journey for me, but it's working with people that, even though I disagree with at times on bringing this together, to make sure that more citizens are safer today than they were yesterday. 
   This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support that.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Thank you for yielding. 
   As we have heard today, the TAA program helps hardworking Americans transition to the global economy and adjust to economic changes resulting from the trade policy of the United States. Training and education play a major role in whether workers will have future success on the job. We have seen the dissatisfaction of the American people with the global economy. You have heard from many of my colleagues on how many people have lost jobs. Most of them are manufacturing jobs. 
   A lot of these people that lose their jobs can be trained. I am happy to say that the Ways and Means Committee worked with me on making sure career and technical schools and colleges have the opportunity to be part of the TAA program. It is important for people to understand when someone is in their late fifties and they lose their job because of the global economy, that they have skills but they need to upgrade those skills for the world that we are seeing in the future. Technical and career colleges offer those particular uses. 
   I am happy to say that the TAA bill that the Democrats have put forward are going to help our workers throughout this country, and with health care so that they can provide. Our workers are putting in more time than ever before. Our productivity is up. But, again, we have to keep pace with education. I am very happy to say that we are part of that educational system. 
   This is a good bill. I rise against the Republican substitute because it doesn't fill the bill. We have waited too long to get this done.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (FACTS ABOUT NICS -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to some inaccurate information being spread on H.R. 2640, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act. As you know, Federal law prohibits nine groups of individuals from obtaining a firearm. One such group includes individuals who are determined to be mentally ill or who were committed to a mental institution. These determinations and commitments are made in accordance with the State law and always in accordance with due process. One purpose of H.R. 2640 is to ensure that information on these people make it into the Federal gun background check system. 
   According to officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA officials make no determination or commitment regarding the legal mental health status of any of our veterans. However, some groups continue to believe that the VA is sending data to the NICS system on veterans who do not meet the disqualification of gun rights. 
   To ensure our veterans are not losing their gun rights, I included several protective provisions in H.R. 2640. These provisions ensure two things. First, the VA will only provide records on veterans determined by the same procedures that apply to nonveterans in regards to mental health. Second, they require that the removal from NICS of a veteran's records that do not meet the law's standards. 
   The intent and purpose of these sections is clear. NICS should only have information on veterans disqualified  because they were legally determined to be mentally ill or involuntarily committed to a mental institution. The VA will not transfer information on veterans who just were treated for posttraumatic syndrome or who have a VA disability rating based on some mental health problem that does not reach the legal threshold of mental illness within the State. 
   In addition, I recognize that mental illness is not necessarily a permanent impediment. Since the State made the initial determination of mental illness, that State should be able to remove that determination. H.R. 2640 contains a section to address this section. 
   If a State elects to receive funds authorized by H.R. 2640, it must establish a procedure to review and, if appropriate, reverse mental health status. A veteran or any other individual will be able to apply to a State court, board, commission or any other lawful authority. That authority would review the person's situation. It is up to the State to set up and determine how the procedure will operate in accordance with due process. I expect that a State would use the same process that it uses to make the initial determination or commitment. 
   H.R. 2640 does not change how a person is found to be disqualified from obtaining or possessing a gun. The language and procedures of the Gun Control Act of 1968 remain in effect. The bill does, however, insist that NICS receives only records on disqualified persons, whether a veteran or nonveteran. 
   H.R. 2640 would also allow States to establish procedures that permit a person disqualified on the basis of legal mental illness to prove to the State that he or she no longer poses a danger to society. 
   I believe that H.R. 2640 is fair and it is balanced. I am hoping the other body will soon approve the bill so that the States will be encouraged to provide information that improves the background check system on gun purchases. This was a bill that was worked out together here in the House. It had strong bipartisan support. If the bill had been placed when it was first passed in the year 2002, there is a possibility that Mr. Cho from Virginia Tech would not have been able to obtain a gun and commit the unfortunate murders that he did. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is common sense that when you work with the NRA, and certainly those that consider me a fair person on reducing gun violence in this country, that we need to get the other body to pass this bill so we can save lives.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis of Illinois and Congressman Westmoreland from Georgia, also. 
   March marks the 95th anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Founded in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low, with only 18 members, Girl Scouts is now the finest organization for girls in the world, with close to 4 million active members and more than 50 million former members, and I am proud to say I am one of them. 
   Girl Scouts provides high-quality, age-appropriate experiences for girls locally, nationally and internationally that build girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place. 
   For 95 years, Girl Scouts has served girls through a remarkable leadership development program delivered by dedicated volunteers in every community across the country. All programs are girl-driven and provide girls with a wide variety of leadership building activities that promote teamwork and the development of strong decision-making skills. 
   There are many programs to choose from, including more than 70 achievement badges encouraging girls to pursue education and careers in math, science and engineering, an anti-bullying and violence prevention program, and a program that connects girls with their mothers who are incarcerated. 
   Girl Scouts also offer a huge range of outreach activities to girls who have never had the opportunity to be a Girl Scout, including Latina and Native American girls, along with girls in rural communities and in public housing developments. 
   Girl Scouts recognizes the importance of giving a voice to girls by sharing original research reviews that have helped change the dialogue among the media, policymakers and community leaders on issues important to girls. They have released numerous reports that have helped shape policy discussions in this country. 
   In celebrating 95 years of excellence and the significant contributions, Girl Scouts will raise the bar in being the voice for all girls. 
   Help me commend the Girl Scouts of the United States of America for its leadership and expertise in meeting the needs of girls throughout their 95 years of remarkable programs, knowledge and information about girls who recognize the nearly 1 million current adult volunteers and volunteers through the decades. 
   Mr. Speaker, spending time as a Girl Scout when I was a young child I have to say was a wonderful, wonderful experience. Back then, we only worked on homemaking skills. We did things that girls did in the early 1960s, but today I am proud to say that when you see the Girl Scouts working together, serving, certainly volunteerism in nursing homes and helping our elderly, mentoring for those students that need it, they have come a long way and they are on the right track, certainly expanding their horizon for what they are going to do. When they meet with other Girl Scouts internationally, it is a wonderful opportunity so different countries can get to know each other. 
   They are the future of our Nation, and I am proud of them, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. 
   In the past couple of weeks we have seen many Americans wondering what's going on; what's going on with our economy; what is going on down in Washington. People have watched anxiously as the markets and the banks have stumbled and many of us have seen investments that we spent years building up now disappearing within days. 
   Within only a couple of days, some of the world's largest financial institutions shut their doors and the U.S. Treasury Secretary had begun talks with Congress in an effort to avoid a potential collapse of our economy. 
   In recent days, we have seen and heard a variety of proposals to address the financial crisis. Americans have rightly been disturbed by the idea that Congress would bail out Wall Street and CEOs, but we also know that we could not just stand by and watch our economy crumble. 
   People needed to know that Congress was acting in their best interests and that their hard-earned money is going to be safer. We needed to make sure that not only was Wall Street going to remain solvent, but so was all our small towns and villages across this country. 
   We also needed to make sure that every proposal we put forward would protect those Americans who were hoping to retire within this year or next year so they don't lose their savings they need to live on. 
   I am pleased that we have been able to come up with a comprehensive package that strikes a fair balance and can potentially offer the relief we need to restore confidence in the markets. Both sides certainly don't like what's been put in front of us to have us in this position, but both sides, both leaders of our political parties have worked together--BARNEY FRANK, Mr. Bachus, Mr. Boehner, Roy Blunt, Nancy Pelosi. 
   This is a crisis that is facing our country. And I know it's a tough vote, especially right before an election. This might cost some of us our election, but that's why we're here, we're here to certainly protect the American people. I'm here to protect my constituents back home, making sure that they have jobs in the next coming months. 
   We have to make sure this bill passes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, my number one concern as we debate the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is my constituents and how the instability and lack of confidence in our financial markets is going to affect them. 
   I am concerned that if we do not act soon we will find ourselves in a recession, the effects of which will be felt for many years to come. 
   In my district on Long Island, New York, we have already felt the effects of the foreclosure crisis. A large number of foreclosures in my district have already resulted in a decrease in home values for families and property tax revenue for Municipalities. 
   Now, my constituents are beginning to see the effects of the current economic crisis. 
   Small businesses in my district are seeing a decrease in activity. After seeing a decrease in the value of their 401k's, individuals who were thinking of retiring in the next year are having to reconsider that decision. Families preparing to send a child to college are finding it more difficult to obtain a loan. 
   All these things have consequences: Small- and medium-sized business owners may have to lay off workers or shut down; those planning for retirement may not be able to do so; and parents may have to tell their children that college just isn't an option. 
   If we do not act, this will only be the beginning. As unemployment rises, more people are unable to spend money on items large and small and the downward spiral begins. As banks make it difficult to obtain a loan for a house or car those industries begin to decline and the downward spiral continues. 
   This will all occur at the same time that families are being required to spend more money on gas and facing another cold winter with almost double the home heating costs compared to last year. 
   The causes of the problem are complicated but easy to identify. The proponents of deregulation have been able to slowly peal away requirements that would have kept companies like Bear Stearns from being too big to fail. Additionally, what little regulations we have been able to save from opponents of regulations were not properly enforced by an Administration who thought that the markets would regulate themselves. 
   It is unfortunate that the actions on Wall Street are going to affect Merrick Road and Hempstead Turnpike. But this is the reality of the situation we are faced with today. Merrick Road and Hempstead Turnpike are why I am going to vote for this bill today. 
   I am pleased that we have been able to come up with a compromise package that strikes a fair balance and can potentially offer the relief we need to restore confidence in the markets to ensure economic stability for the families in my district. 
   We will first reinvest in our troubled financial markets. Stabilizing our economy will insulate our communities from the mistakes and bad decisions of Wall Street. The Secretary of the Treasury will be allowed to invest $350 billion and potentially up to $700 billion in troubled assets held by financial institutions that are currently unwilling to extend lines of credit to each other or to small businesses. 
   The Secretary will buy up the securities that no one wants and that have almost no short-term value. This does not mean that they do not have any value. In fact, many of these securities have substantial long-term value and the U.S. taxpayer will realize this value over time. 
   We will then reimburse the taxpayer for this reinvestment. We have required that the Secretary take an interest on behalf of the taxpayer in any financial institution that sells troubled assets to the U.S. This will allow the taxpayer to be reimbursed for reinvesting in Wall Street. 
   If full reimbursement is not realized at the end of five years, the President is required to submit a plan to Congress to recoup any losses to the taxpayer. 
   In order to ensure that this program works for the American people, provisions requiring strong independent oversight and transparency have been included. Within 48-hours the Secretary is required to post details of every transaction. There will be periodic reports on everything from whether taxpayer dollars are used effectively to whether conflicts of interests are managed properly. Every $50 billion investment by the Secretary must be followed by a report justifying all transactions and the pricing of each purchase. 
   We will also reform how business is done on Wall Street. 
   Golden parachutes for executives are prohibited, compensation that encourages unnecessary risk-taking putting shareholders investment at risk is limited and bonuses can be recovered that are paid to executives who promise gains based on false and inaccurate information. 
   In evaluating transactions, the Secretary must protect the taxpayer and encourage the modification of home loans at-risk of foreclosure. As the one holding these mortgage-backed securities, we will have put the Secretary in a position to work with servicers to ensure that those who can afford their homes are able to modify their mortgages in order to stay in their homes. 
   At the end of the day, this compromise will ensure unemployment does not increase, families will be able to access lines of credit to make purchases, small businesses are able to make payroll, and municipalities are able to continue providing the services our communities rely on. 
   I will vote in favor of this compromise so that the families in my district who are already struggling under high gas prices and property taxes and facing high home heating prices will not be further burdened by the mistakes of Wall Street.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (DEALING WITH THE HIGH PRICE OF GASOLINE -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the year, gas prices across the Nation have been increasing. With the summer driving season fast approaching, prices at the pump are again reaching record highs. 
   With the price quickly approaching $4 a gallon, it is time again for Congress to act to help consumers with this increased cost. High gas prices not only increase the cost of living for American families, but increased gas prices will affect the prices on nearly every single consumer good on the market. Working families are not only paying more at the pump, but at the grocery store, the pharmacy and the shopping malls as well. 
   These increases have a harmful effect on our Nation's economy and security. They make it harder for working families to commute to and from work, especially in cases where public transportation is lacking. It also increases the cost for public transportation, which makes it harder for those individuals without automobiles to travel. 
   But we see the effects of high prices across the board. Parcel delivery rates increase. Municipalities must increase their taxes to pay for gas for their emergency responder vehicles. Our utilities go up. We cannot afford to stand by idly as our cost of living steadily increases for the sake of continued record oil company profits. 
   In response to the rising gas prices, I have requested that the Federal Trade Commission investigate possible gasoline price gouging and hold those accountable who engage in such practices. 
   I am also a cosponsor of Congressman Stupak's legislation, H.R. 1252, the Federal Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act. This much needed legislation calls on the FTC and the Attorney General to investigate possible price gouging, both nationally and locally, and to prosecute any group found to be taking advantage of the American people. As summer approaches, travel within the United States historically does increase. According to the Automobile Association of America, gasoline prices may reach an all-time high by Memorial Day. 
   The time has come for Congress and the President to work together on a solution for the American people. Earlier this year the House passed legislation to repeal tax breaks for oil companies while devoting more Federal resources to renewable fuels. I am hopeful the Senate will quickly act on this much needed legislation this month. 
   If we are serious about reducing our dependency on foreign oil, we must work with manufacturers and researchers to bring renewable fuels to the forefront. Our environment and economy depend on it. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure American consumers are given a voice about the high price of gasoline.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (FIREARM TRACING DATA -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, for the last several weeks you have heard me talk about gun violence in this country, and I happen to think there are solutions where we can reduce gun violence. 
   I would like to talk about firearm tracing data. Firearm tracing data gives law enforcement agencies the ability to retrieve useful data on guns used in crimes. Tracing data will let our police departments locate the gun dealers who sell guns used in crimes. Without this tracing data, local law enforcement will not be able to pursue civil action on suppliers that have been implicated in crimes without asking the ATF's permission first. 
   It is important that we use tracing data to single out the bad gun owners. One percent of gun owners sell 50 percent of the guns used in crime in this country. That is a staggering number. We can crack down on that 1 percent. We can make our streets and cities safer. The collection of tracing data does not prevent anyone from purchasing a gun. It simply gives law enforcement the tools that they need to solve crimes.  
   As you can see by this chart, 91 percent of Americans believe that tracing data should be used in some form to help crimes, 91 percent. Why aren't we doing a better job on helping our police officers do their job? 
   Last week, New York Mayor Bloomberg teamed up with Boston Mayor Menino on this very issue. Together they have formed a bipartisan coalition of more than 120 mayors from across the country. The group has many mayors from the urban as well as the rural areas. These mayors understand the need for tracing data. They understand that Congress has done little to help gun violence and stop gun violence in this country. 
   They are tired of sitting back as their cities lose more and more citizens to gun violence. By the way, they are also tired of seeing the health care costs on those victims that do survive. This is something that we should be dealing with. It is a health care crisis in this country. 
   Last week, they held their annual conference here in Washington. They spoke with Members from both sides of the aisle. This is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. It is not a pro-gun or anti-gun issue. It is a pro-law enforcement issue with common sense, and it is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. 
   We must do everything in our power to keep guns out of the hands of those that don't deserve to have a gun. That is why I introduced the NICS Improvement Act. This bill will simply strengthen the States. Right now when the NICS system doesn't have the information in it, how can it basically report out who should not be able to buy a gun? 
   My NICS bill will be giving the States the money to bring their computers up to speed, so that way when someone is adjudicated in court, whether it is on a felony or on domestic violence, someone who should not be able to get a gun shouldn't be able to get approved through the approved NICS system. This is common sense. 
   Again, this is a pro-safety issue. It doesn't affect anyone who wants to buy a gun, but it makes this country safer from gun violence. 
   I know it is a very political issue. Everyone is always saying that you are trying to take away my gun. I have never done that. What I am trying to do is save lives; and I am trying to save, certainly, people from being harmed. Our mayors across this great country understand that. 
   We can do a better job. Congress needs to start listening to the American people. These statistics show that gun owners, by the way, approve overwhelmingly of being able to trace these guns. We should be able to do it. We can do a better job. Americans should have a safer country.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Childers substitute amendment to H.R. 6842, the National Capitol Security and Safety Act, that would get in the way of the democratic process currently underway to reform the District of Columbia's gun laws and dictate to the district what all gun laws must be. 
   When the Supreme Court came up, in one way I was very happy because I think almost all of us have agreed in one way or the other, that people have the right to own a gun. But now I'm disappointed to see that we're actually overturning what the Supreme Court had said. They basically said the Court ruled that the second amendment right is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. That's a quote, unquote from their wording. 
   We have an obligation to keep our communities safe from gun violence. I believe that the Heller decision actually allows us to move ahead to create commonsense gun laws that do not hinder the right to gun ownership but rather keep guns out of the wrong hands and keep communities and individuals safe from gun violence. 
   My colleague from the other side basically said, D.C. doesn't even have gun stores so the residents can't buy guns. That's not true. There is a gun store in the D.C. area, and I'm sure within a year we'll see many other gun stores there. 
   Heller paved the way for Congress to move forward on passing the kind of laws that will protect our communities and where we work and certainly in the D.C. area. 
   The District of Columbia is fully committed to appropriate response to Heller and reform its gun laws in a manner that is consistent with the rulings in the decision. 
   Make no mistake. This is not a battle, again, about is there a right to own a gun. The courts have put that out. D.C. is applying to that. 
   The District enacted temporary legislation in response to Heller, the Firearms Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 on July 16, 2008, which will only remain in effect for 90 days as the District is currently drafting permanent laws that would fully comply with Heller. 
   Why are we doing this? What is the rush? 
   You know, we, unfortunately, have seen D.C. go under some terrible times. But, again, I will say to you that again changing our laws or having this Congress dictate to D.C. is not the right way to go. The Mayor and the City Council are tasked to make sure that this occurs. 
   Unfortunately, some Members of Congress want to circumvent the democratic process underway in the District of Columbia. 
   The Heller decision clearly states that local governments can enact their own appropriate restrictions on gun ownership. Let me say that again. The States and local governments can enact their own appropriate restrictions on gun ownership. 
   However, the substitute amendment, based largely on H.R. 6691, would dictate to the District of Columbia what gun laws it must be. 
   H.R. 6691 will repeal the District's ban on most semi-automatic weapons, preempting many of the District's regulations on gun possession, including gun registrations. 
   Let me say this. We have a battle with the NRA. The battle has always been the right to own a gun. I'm not arguing that. The Court has stated that. The District has the right to write their own laws.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 293 honoring volunteer service and thank Representative Shea-Porter for introducing this bill. As Chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I wanted to highlight this extremely important issue which is why the first hearing the HFC Subcommittee held was on national service. This is a bipartisan issue, and I am looking forward to working with Ranking Member Platts to move ahead on reauthorizing the service bill. 
   National service has a distinguished and strong history in our Nation. Our roots in service extend back to the first pioneers, when colonists had to ban together to overcome the challenges of surviving and adjusting to a new land. 
   Evidence shows that service and volunteering lowers dropout rates among teens, lowers crime rates in communities with high rates of volunteerism, lowers costs associated with the aging population and improves the health and lowers the rates of depression among the elderly. Volunteering is a cost effective way of meeting our Nation's social needs both from the standpoint of the volunteers and the people who benefit from the services. 
   In my home state of New York, more than 76,000 people of all ages and backgrounds are helping to meet local needs and strengthen communities. There are 239 national service programs in New York alone. In my district we have more than 1,300 service volunteers, and we have almost 3,000 students age K-12 that participate in the Learn and Serve programs. 
   I truly believe that expanding national service, particularly to disadvantaged youth, is an effective way to combat things like youth gangs and violence, and the evidence bears that out. And it is critical that we begin teaching about participation and service at an early age. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congresswoman Shea-Porter for her hard work to in introducing this resolution. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (COMMENDING ULYSSES BYIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the good works of the students of the Ulysses Byis Elementary School in Roosevelt, Long Island, in my district. 
   On Tuesday, March 18, I visited the students at the school to honor their hard work in raising awareness and funds for humanitarian efforts helping those suffering from the conflict in Darfur, Sudan. The students worked to help achieve and support the mission of the U.N. Millennium Development goals in bringing aid and awareness to health, education, poverty, and sustainable living needs in Africa. 
   Under the guidance of educators Ms. Hazelton, Ms. Warfield, and Principal Lillian Coggins-Watson, the students got involved with the national network of O Ambassador's clubs, a part of Oprah's ``Angel Network,'' with the goal of working to find solutions to global challenges through active learning, idea sharing, and taking action. 
   The students worked diligently and raised $1,100 in just 2 days to benefit relief agencies in the East African Nation of Sudan. These students made an extraordinary effort to help a problem that is very far away from them, and their work and contributions need to be acknowledged. 
   Considering the volume of money Congress manages every single day, $1,100 might sound like a small amount, but the effort by the children of Ulysses Byis Elementary School was massive, considering that many of the families in the Roosevelt School District face harsh economic challenges of their own. 
   The fact that these students worked as hard as they did to raise the money that will help save the lives of people thousands of miles away speaks not only of their extraordinary character, but what a terrific job the teachers and parents in the Roosevelt School District are doing in instilling in the children the qualities that make our citizens and Nation great. 
   The students have not stopped in their efforts to raise money and attention to the difficulties facing the people of Darfur. In fact, since I visited the school just 2 weeks ago, the students have raised over $600 more and have the goal of reaching $5,000 by the end of the school year. They plan to sell scratch-off tickets, hold a walk-a-thon, and continue to collect the pocket change that students bring with them to school. These children will not let any obstacle prevent them from achieving their goal to help the Sudanese people. 
   Some of the money raised by the students will go towards the purchase of mosquito bed nets, which have been shown to dramatically lessen the spread of malaria. The seemingly simple technology of insecticide treated  bed nets has proven to be remarkably effective and can save thousands of lives a year by minimizing one of the region's most deadly diseases. 
   As has been mentioned many times here on the House floor, the situation in Darfur is dire, and financial aid is crucial in helping to manage the humanitarian crisis that is being faced there every day. 
   While we are still working to find ways to help eliminate the violence and brutality of genocide that has become synonymous with Darfur, we need to take a lesson from the students and work to help them manage the health and well-being of the country's population. Each year, thousands of Sudanese will fall victim to disease and famine. What makes these deaths even more tragic is that so many could have been prevented by the use of the kind of bed netting that the money raised by the students will go towards purchasing. 
   Additionally, this week we will vote on H.R. 5510, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hide United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. The bill will provide much-needed funds that will be useful in advancing the causes that the children are working toward. This bill will help impact one of the most important issues of our time, helping to stem the spread of deadly and potentially preventable diseases. 
   It is absolutely vital that the United States Government and Members of this Congress continue to decry the outrageous horrors of genocide and Darfur. And we must continue to find ways, as the children have, to help the Sudanese people survive. 
   I would like to extend my congratulations and deepest gratitude to the students of the Ulysses Byis Elementary School, and their teachers, principals and parents for their tremendous efforts and their spirit of giving and generosity. 
   I would also like to thank and recognize the efforts of Oprah Winfrey for offering the tools and inspiration for the children at the Ulysses Byis School and students throughout the Nation through her Angel Network and O Ambassadors program to take action and to do the hard work necessary to help those less fortunate. 
   Finally, I would just like to tell the students of the Ulysses Byis School to keep up their good work. Don't quit. I know that you will reach and exceed your goals. The people of Darfur need your help, and we are all behind you. I thank the students for the work they have done.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the repeal of the Tiahrt amendment which is up for a vote in the Appropriations Committee tomorrow. 
   The Tiahrt amendment restricts the use of firearm tracing data. Tracing data lets our police departments locate the gun dealers who sell guns used in crimes. One percent of gun dealers sell 57 percent of the guns used in the crimes across the country. That is a staggering statistic. If we can crack down on that 1 percent, we can make our streets and our police officers safer. 
   The collection of tracing data does not prevent anyone from not buying a firearm; it simply gives law enforcement officials the tools they need to do their job. Let's make our streets safer and help law enforcement by repealing the dangerous Tiahrt amendment. 
   With that, I hope the American people start calling their Congresspeople. This is important for all communities and all cities around this country.

   Mr. Speaker, I know Congress isn't used to having straight, clean bills. We can do this. Ten years I have been in Congress, and 10 years we have been trying to get the minimum wage raised. We talk about small business. There is not one person on the Democratic side that doesn't support small businesses, but we also support those people that are trying to make a living wage. 
   By estimates, there are 623,000 single women raising families trying to make a living. I go to the grocery store. I fill up my gas tank. We are very privileged here to make a very nice salary. Yet we are denying those that need our help the most to give them some sort of life. $7.25. Who the heck can live on that, even if you work 60 hours a week? And, by the way, these people that are working these jobs on minimum wage usually have two jobs, sometimes three.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, unfortunately, violence has struck our schools again. Unfortunately, this has been an increasing trend. In the past several years, we have seen countless incidents across the Nation. 
   School violence is not limited to urban areas. Acts of bullying and other violent crimes occur in schools across the Nation on a daily basis. We must do something to stop this growing trend. 
   Our current reporting system on school violence is severely flawed. Under current law, school violence stats are collected through surveys and self-reported data. This data is not the most current data available and does not provide an accurate view of the situation. 
   The FBI has developed a system of reporting that is both comprehensive and up to date. This system is referred to as the NI-BERS System. It collects the data, details of crime incidents, and is a much greater tool to prevent school violence. Accurate data is valuable to addressing this issue. It allows our school administrators to see the true impact of school safety programs and it provides the basis for need-based school funding. 
   In response to these issues, I have introduced the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act. My bill, referred to as the SAFE Act, moves reporting data from surveys to real crime stats in the NI-BERS System. This move will allow schools to accurately address school safety issues. 
   It will also ensure that funding is allotted to the schools that need it the most. Our schools do not have the resources that they need to combat school violence. President Bush has constantly cut funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. These cuts have left our already-overburdened schools without the money needed to stop school violence. 
   The SAFE Act will restore funding for our schools through a need-based grant program. Schools that do not have a safe climate will receive grants from the Department of Education. That money will be used to update school safety programs to curb the needless acts of violence and make our schools safer for our children. If we are serious about school safety, we must not only implement new reporting measures but must fully fund our schools. 
   The SAFE Act is endorsed by the National Parent and Teachers Association, the American Federation of Teachers and the National School Safety and Security Services. 
   Congress has sat and watched as schools across the country have attempted to deal with school violence with insufficient data and little to no funding. We tried to correct this in Leave No Child Behind. So as we reauthorize Leave No Child Behind this year, I am hoping we will be able to implement a better program. We have an opportunity to change the way we handle school violence in this country and truly make our schools safe. 
   We see and hear every day about the violence, when our children are in school and do not feel safe, and I have talked to so many teenagers and middle school students that say that many times they do not feel safe in school. We can do something, but we need a better way of reporting it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (WE MUST ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, as the House begins its work in the 110th Congress, we must address the issue of gun violence. Congress has a responsibility to make sure violent criminals cannot legally purchase guns. I am not proposing any new laws or a ban on buying guns. Instead, we must help our States enforce current laws that prevent criminals from buying guns. 
   The NICS system, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, is the database used to check potential firearm buyers for any criminal records. In large, NICS has been a very good success. Since 1994 more than 700,000 individuals were denied a gun for failing their background check. However, the NICS system is only as good as the information in its database. 
   Mr. Speaker, 25 States have automated less than 60 percent of their felony convictions into the NICS system. In these States, many felons won't turn up on the NICS system and would be able to purchase a gun with no questions asked. 
   In 13 States, domestic violence and restraining orders are not accessible through the NICS system. Common sense would dictate that you don't sell a gun to somebody that has a restraining order. Unfortunately, that is not the case. 
   On March 8, 2002, Peter Troy purchased a .22 caliber semiautomatic rifle. His own mother had a restraining order against him as a result of his violent background. It was illegal for him to purchase a gun, but he simply fell through the cracks. Four days later, Peter Troy walked into Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York, opened fire and killed two innocent people. Peter Troy had no business buying a gun, and the system created to prevent him from buying the gun failed. 
   We must fix the NICS system. That is why I introduced H.R. 297, the NICS Improvement Act. This legislation would provide grants to States to update the NICS system. States would be able to update their NICS database to include felons, domestic abusers and other violent criminals. We need the NICS Improvement Act to become law, and we need to pass more bills like it. 
   These ideas impose no new restrictions on gun owners, but give the government the tools to ensure existing laws are effective and enforceable. In fact, the NICS Improvement Act already passed the House in the 107th Congress by voice vote. Last Congress, a Judiciary subcommittee passed the measure. Unfortunately it did not get to the full committee. 
   This is commonsense gun legislation that we can all agree on. This bill will save lives while not infringing on anybody's second amendment rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I call on Congress to act quickly on H.R. 247. If we can prevent tragedies like this happening throughout the country, we could save lives and enforce the laws already on the books. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring one other subject up. This country is facing a shortage of blood. I would encourage all people in this country to give blood. It is easy, it is painless, and it can save someone's life.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank my chairman on the Education Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I am watching and listening to this debate, and we certainly have had this debate going back into the committee last year. Many of us have said this is only the beginning of what we are going to be doing for our students. 
   When you travel around the world and you look at those students that are going to school and you see what those nations are doing to make sure that their students are prepared for the global economy, I have always thought, what are we doing here? What are we doing here in the United States? 
   I heard that some people say they can go to college without taking out a loan. Well, I wish a lot of my students back home, my constituents' children, could do that. Almost all the students that I know that are going to school have a job and go to school, because that is their dream. 
   Then I hear that this is not going to do anything for our students that are in school. I sit on the Financial Services Committee also, and we know the burden that our young people are facing when they finish college because of the interest rates. We are trying to address that. As I said, this is the first of the things that we will be doing to make sure that our students have the opportunity to go to college, to keep the costs down and help them on every single level. 
   This actually fits, in my opinion, with Leave No Child Behind, which we will be addressing in the committee this year also. We want our students to be well prepared so they are able to go to college, and it fits together, and we are going to make sure that we have a good plan for Leave No Child Behind. I am looking forward to working on that. 
   College education is expensive, and yet we know that our students need to go to college to compete in the global economy that we are facing. This Nation has not stood up to help our students, and we need to do a better job of it. This is the beginning of that. 
   I hope all my colleagues will support this bill.

   This is a great day for national service. It's been 15 years since we have reauthorized our national service laws. 
   As chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I am pleased to speak in support of H.R. 5563, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act. Unfortunately, this legislation hit a procedural hurdle last week, but I am glad the House will today have a chance once again to pass this important piece of legislation. 
   The bill before us today incorporates the amendments that were accepted on the floor last week, including my manager's amendment, and amendments offered by Representative McKeon, Matsui and Shays, Inslee, Sarbanes, McDermott, three amendments from Representative English and two amendments from Representative Sutton. It also includes the language from the Republican motion to recommit. 
   The administration and the service community support the GIVE Act. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Miller again for his continued support and work on this reauthorization. I would also like to extend my thanks to the ranking member of our committee, Mr. McKeon, for his hard work. And finally, I would like to thank the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Platts, for his work on the reauthorization. 
   I would also like to thank again the staff on both sides of the aisle for their work on this important piece of legislation. 
   National service has a distinguished and strong history in our Nation. The benefits of service cannot be duplicated. Evidence shows that service and volunteering lowers school dropouts and crime rates, lowers costs associated with the aging population, and improves the health among the elderly. 
   Volunteering is a cost effective way of working to solve the challenges facing our Nation. That is why the passage of the GIVE Act is necessary. 
   One of the most effective volunteer organizations in this Nation is AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps volunteers offer a range of services focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities. Our legislation recognizes their invaluable work and increases the number of participants to 100,000. 
   The GIVE Act also encourages programs to recruit underrepresented populations to serve, including scientists and engineers, young people in and/or aging out of foster care, children at risk for delinquency, and other disadvantaged young people. I truly believe that expanding national service, particularly to disadvantaged youth, is an effective way to combat things like gangs and violence, and the evidence bears that out. 
   If we are serious about reducing gang violence in this Nation, we must take the first step and offer our children an alternative. This legislation creates the Summer of Service program which gives middle school and high school students an opportunity to become engaged in a positive way within their community. Through the Summer of Service program, our Nation's young people will have a chance to serve with others of their own age while improving their community. 
   Research shows that if students are engaged in service at an early age, they will continue to serve throughout their lifetime. 
   We are strengthening the mission of the first responder volunteer program, the National Civilian Community Corps, by requiring more intense disaster and emergency relief training during down periods in order to be better prepared for the future.     
   We are all aware of what our Nation faced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the NCCC was there to respond and continues to recover today. 
   The GIVE Act will help our Nation become better prepared for future disasters by training and preparing more emergency volunteers. The GIVE Act creates cooperation and an Office of Outreach in recruitment. This new office, among other duties, will establish a reserve corps made of those who have gone through the program and are alumni. The reserve corps alumni will be called upon during emergencies and disasters or other times of national needs. 
   We heard people asking over and over again during our hearings why aren't we using our former members. The new outreach office will work to connect the over-500,000 former volunteers who can be a resource for the recruitment. The GIVE Act lowers the age of participation in the national senior service to 55 years of age. By lowering the age, we are encouraging retiring Americans to participate in national service and giving older Americans the opportunity to lead us into the future. 
   Our Nation's retiring and retired adults are a rich resource that no one  can duplicate, nor should they be overlooked. Every American, old and young, has skills that can improve the day-to-day functions of our society. The GIVE Act encourages individuals to get involved, creates a deeper commitment to service, and makes our Nation more like what it should be. 
   I, again, want to thank Chairman Miller for his deep commitment to national service and Ranking Member McKeon and Congressman Platts for their work with us on this bipartisan activity. I do urge all of my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. (RECONNECTING HOMELESS YOUTH ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R. 5524, The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act. 
   This bill reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which is under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee which I chair, the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. Yarmuth, the bill's sponsor, is on my subcommittee and it was a pleasure to work with him on this reauthorization. Each  member of my subcommittee is both passionate and committed to improving the lives of our Nation's children. In this case, Mr. Yarmuth is seeking to assist some of our Nation's most vulnerable youth, those who run away from home or who have no home. 
   It is a travesty that this situation exists in our Nation--that children find themselves in situations where they need to leave their home for any number of reasons--they are thrown out, have been abused, and face other challenges at home. Worse yet, too many of our Nation's foster care youth find themselves released from the system at or around age 18 and are left to fend for themselves without guidance or little to no assistance, and they become part of the over one million runaway or homeless youth in our Nation. These resilient youth seek caring adults, stability, and the ability to see their future as different from their present situation. 
   This reauthorization improves the basic central programs, street outreach programs, and the transitional living program. As we heard in a hearing in my subcommittee, it is just too easy to look away and dismiss the problem or accept that it is inevitable that there will be homeless youth. We see it, acknowledge it, and do nothing about it. However, if we dismiss or tolerate the problem of runaway and homeless youth, I think that we can easily expect that we will see these youth in other social systems where they may stay for the rest of their lives. Helping these youth in the here and now is both intervention and prevention. We must maintain a long-term vision for our Nation's youth. Investing in all children at an early age is clearly necessary, but we also must attend to our older youth who face challenges that neither you nor I have experienced as teenagers and young people. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Yarmuth has worked very hard with the community that works with runaway and homeless youth to create a strong reauthorization of these programs. He has included the development and implementation of performance standards to be used in the grant making process, to better allow the Family and Youth Services Bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate each program and fund the best of the best. You see, these programs are good, and the competition is strong for any funding that is available. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 5524, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act today. It is an investment in our Nation's most vulnerable youth and in all of America's young people. They seek caring adults and opportunities to improve their lives at home and their futures. If we help these youth now, we prevent them from entering into child welfare and juvenile justice systems, each path fraught with challenges. I think that we can all come together to change the lives of children for the better.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY PROJECT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I thank my colleague from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 998, the Civil Rights Oral History Project. I want to thank Chairman BRADY and Ranking Member Ehlers and the Committee on House Administration for moving to the floor on this bill. 
   I also want to thank my lead cosponsor of the bill, Congressman JOHN LEWIS of Georgia, himself a civil rights hero, for all of his help in developing and generating support for this bill. 
   Mr. Lewis was at the forefront of the battle to end segregation, and his contribution to ensuring equality in our country cannot be overstated. I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that we are honored to serve with him, and grateful for all he has done and continues to do for all Americans as a steward of justice and equal rights. 
   We are fortunate to serve in Congress with several other influential civil rights leaders, and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you for their sacrifices and commitment to the cause of freedom. 
   The fight for civil rights was one of the most significant social and cultural movements in our Nation's history. The will of a generation to right centuries of injustice changed the world we live in forever. 
   The leaders of the civil rights movement displayed tremendous courage and persistence to ensure that all Americans were treated equally, with dignity, regardless of their ethnic background, race or origins. Many leaders from all walks of life put their lives on the line to make it possible for all people to live freely and have the same fundamental rights. 
   We can never overstate the contributions of our Nation's civil rights leaders. Without their efforts, many of the things we take for granted every day would not have come to pass. It is vital that future generations know and understand the struggles and the challenges of those that paved the way for us to live in this Nation free. 
   These brave Americans' stories must continue to be told to not only inspire future generations, but to remind people what is possible in America and how far we have come. Unfortunately, with each passing year, our Nation loses more and more of the people that played major roles in the struggles to secure equal rights for all Americans. In recent years we have lost great leaders like Mrs. Coretta Scott King and Mrs. Rosa Parks. Thankfully, their stories have been well documented in the historical record, but there are many others who have already passed or whose memories are fading. 
   While we know so much about the lives of the leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Dr. Martin Luther King; our colleague, Congressman JOHN LEWIS; and Thurgood Marshall, it's important that we learn about the everyday people of all races who took a stand during a pivotal time in our Nation's history. 
   There were so many people who were crucial to the civil rights movement but have not had as much recorded about their experiences for the public record. These were the people, in many cases, that were part of some of the most significant battles in the fight for equality. The workers in Memphis that went on strike and marched in protest with Dr. King, the students that held sit-ins at lunch counters in the South, the thousands of people that marched on Washington and witnessed the ``I Have a Dream Speech,'' and the millions of Americans that stood up and worked in their own ways to make our country a better place for all people. These people are heroes of the civil rights movement, and we need to make sure that their stories are woven into the fabric of the American story. 
   That's why I have introduced the Civil Rights Oral History bill. The purpose of the Civil Rights Oral History bill is to catalogue and preserve the stories and experiences of the people who were involved in the civil rights movement. 
   This legislation stresses the importance of capturing the memories and the deeds of the civil rights generation and will give us a unique insight into the experiences of the people that we rely on in the front lines of the civil rights movement. 
   This bill will create a joint effort between the future National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress to collect oral histories of the people that were involved in the civil rights movement and preserve their stories for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to take the time to acknowledge the contributions of these great Americans who fought to make our Nation a more fair and just place. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have been going for a number of years working with our veterans across this Nation to get the history from them, an oral history, that has been going to the Library of Congress. That's where this idea came from. 
   When you think that we are really a very young country, and hopefully, we're going to be around for centuries to come, and I think it's important that future generations actually know how we became a great country, but also the struggles that many Americans went through. This bill will help preserve that. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this bill. This is for the future of America; it's for the future of the generations to see the history.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 63. Despite the brave efforts of our troops, the situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. Our troops have gone above and beyond the call of duty. Unfortunately, they are caught in the middle of sectarian violence. 
   From the onset of the conflict, there has been mismanagement and mishandling from this administration. The administration was not prepared for the violence following the removal of Saddam Hussein. 
   In addition, the previous Congress did not do its job. The 110th Congress held the first oversight hearing since the invasion in 2003. That is 4 years without any congressional oversight. 
   I have heard so many speeches here saying that we support the troops. I think everyone, every single Member, supports the troops. Yet all those years that we were hearing from the families and from our soldiers themselves, saying they did not have the equipment, they did not have certainly the equipment to keep them safe, where were we? Where were we as Members in making sure that our military had the best equipment? 
   Since January, we have had 52 oversight hearings on Iraq. It turns out that nearly $12 billion from the American taxpayers have not been accounted for. That is $12 billion that could have been spent on our equipment to protect our troops. Our troops deserve better. 
   The President explained his new plan for Iraq last month. Again, I hear that we must stand by the President. Well, I was one that stood by the President. I voted with the President. I voted for every appropriation for the President, and now he is doing the same thing. It is not working. It has not worked. It is time for a new plan. 
   He called for an increase of 20,000 more troops in Iraq and, unfortunately, I am afraid that this is a little bit too late. We needed hundreds of thousands of troops in the beginning. That is when the generals asked for those troops and they were denied.  
   The truth of the matter is we did this war on the cheap. We did not do it right in the beginning, and now we are all paying the consequences. 
   Throughout the conflict our troop levels have changed. We have sent more troops in when our generals called for them. Then they were made smaller. To no fault of our troops, the extra numbers did not calm the situation. I do not believe that putting more of our brave men and women in harm's way is the solution to this conflict. 
   President Bush emphasized his intentions of placing more authority and responsibility on the Iraqi Government. Well, it is about time. We have spent a lot of money to train the police officers, to train their military, and yet they are not standing up for their own country. 
   Prime Minister Maliki has not proven that he can stop the violence that is going on in his country. That should not mean that our troops should be there. Our troops are trained for a war, not to settle political differences in that country. He has failed to bring equal representations of the Sunnis and the Shiites into the Iraqi Government. This shortfall has fueled sectarian violence, putting our troops in greater harm. 
   Poor planning by civilian leaders within the administration has placed our brave men and women in harm's way. Our troops have gone above and beyond the call of duty. They have served our country bravely and honorably, and we all know that. Many of these troops have served their full tours of duty in Iraq, and they have left behind family and friends to defend this great Nation. 
   More than 3,000 of our men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice, and not one of them, in my opinion, has died in vain because they were doing their duty. We sent them there, and they have lived up to that, and thousands more have suffered debilitating injuries. 
   It is time to shift the burden of this conflict to the Iraqis themselves. We have a responsibility in Congress to make sure that our troops are not put unnecessarily in harm's way. 
   President Bush has made his decisions without consulting enough experts and retired generals. Where was all the information that we needed years ago as far as bringing the experts, knowing what the culture was in the Middle East? That is something that we still are not addressing here. 
   Decisions have not been clearly thought out and our troops have paid the price. And after much thought, I have come to the conclusion that a phased redeployment of our troops is the best option. 
   No one is really talking about Afghanistan either. When we started, we were winning in Afghanistan. When we took those troops out of Afghanistan, we started seeing the insurgents coming in. We can put our troops along the borders. We can stop the insurgents coming into Iraq while the Iraqi Government tries to solve their own problems.     
   We can go back into Afghanistan and make sure that we shore up that country so more insurgents and military equipment are not coming from that country. 
   We must show the American people and our allies, by the way, who are leaving, they are not supporting us, it is not just Democrats and a lot of our Republican colleagues that feel that we should get out. Our strategy has been wrong, it is time to work together, and I am hoping after all these debates, when we come back from our break, we can actually go to our committees and come up with a way to solve these problems, not only for America, but before the world.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (GLIDER PILOTS OF WORLD WAR II -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the glider pilots of World War II. 
   Glider planes were lightweight aircraft without engines that were used to drop supplies and reinforcement personnel for troops and surveillance. They were very efficient, because they made no noise and could fly into the enemy areas undetected. 
   The gliders would be towed by larger planes in order to take off, but then would fly and land on their own. The glider pilots flew dangerous missions and were constantly at risk for being shot down. Glider pilots were instrumental in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, despite the fact that pilots had to improvise on landings, since no known landing strips were known to be behind enemy lines. 
   Later in the war, the Germans would plant wooden poles in open fields to prevent glider pilots from landing. The U.S. Army Air Forces began training glider pilots in 1942. The program quickly grew during the war. Eventually, over 6,500 men were trained to be glider pilots. 
   Throughout World War II, the glider pilots flew eight successful missions. The glider pilots' first mission occurred on July 19, 1942, Operation Husky, which was called for the glider pilots to carry British airborne troops into Sicily. Despite the heavy casualties from landing at the sea, the glider pilots completed their mission. 
   In March of 1944, the glider pilots completed Operation Broadway in Burma. The glider pilots took the Japanese completely by surprise, carrying troops, airborne engineers and equipment by night. They seized and prepared landing strips for forthcoming transport planes and evacuated the wounded. The glider pilots accomplished this feat in 2 hours, completing a mission that would have taken 2 months by ambulance. 
   Perhaps the most famous mission of the glider pilots was the Battle of Normandy. On D-Day the glider pilots participated in the largest combined airborne and seaborne invasion in history. They carried troops of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division and their equipment to landing areas behind enemy lines. Their work helped to secure victory in World War II. 
   Mr. Speaker, each year we lose more and more of these courageous veterans. I believe Congress must recognize their accomplishments for the future generations of our veterans. That is why I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 42. This bill recognizes the glider pilots and the many troops who put their lives on the line to defend the ideas and the freedoms of our country. All of our glider missions were successful. Unfortunately, casualties were suffered. 
   On March 20, ``Silent Wings,'' a documentary on these great pilots, will be released. The documentary features interviews with glider pilots, Members of Congress and media icons. I will be sponsoring a viewing of this powerful film on the evening of March 20. 
   I hope you will all join me to commemorate these veterans. We must all remember and teach future generations about the sacrifices that glider pilots and all veterans made for our country. I urge my colleagues to support the glider pilots and cosponsor H. Con. Res. 42.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment to S. 2371. This bill makes technical corrections to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in order to ensure that the Department of Education and other relevant stakeholders reflect congressional intent when implementing the law. 
   Mr. Speaker, during this Congress we have made significant commitments to our Nation's students and families by putting resources into the hands of those that need it the most. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act as passed and signed by the President does more to help Americans pay for college than any other effort since the GI Bill, at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Specifically, the legislation provided a landmark investment of $20 billion in additional funding for Pell Grants, reductions in the interest rates on student loans, and the creation of programs to help students manage debt, as well as encourage individuals to pursue public service. 
   Providing this critical funding is a large part of our efforts to increase access and affordability to higher education. Our work on reforming and strengthening higher education is not finished for this Congress. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the rest of the Education and Labor Committee on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as it continues through the process. As passed by the Senate and amended in this bill, the technical amendments contained in the bill clarify the definition of untaxed income and benefits to ensure it does not include those items in the calculation that were removed from the list under CCRAA; clarifies that married borrowers' income-based repayment payments shall be determined solely on the individual borrower's loan information and the individual's income without considering the spouse's income or any other loan debt that they may have if the married borrower files taxes separately; conforms language in the TEACH Grant Program to ensure appropriate implementation. 
   Mr. Speaker, swift passage of S. 2371, as amended, will ensure that students and families will fully benefit from the programs, funding, and intent provided in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I urge my colleagues to support this provision. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN COMES FIRST ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson), the sponsor of H.R. 2517, the Protecting Our Children Comes First Act, and urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of the Missing Children's Assistance Act. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lampson, for his continued leadership on this issue. Mr. Lampson is founder of the Missing Children's Caucus and has worked tirelessly to support the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. His passion for protecting our Nation's children inspires others to get involved and work to create safe places for our young people, including on the Internet. 
   This bipartisan reauthorization continues the work of the Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Child Protection Division's missing and exploited children's programs, including funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   Furthermore, this legislation continues the authorization for National Incidence Studies, known as ``NISMART.'' According to CRS, the first NISMART study ``provided the first nationally representative, comprehensive data on the incidence of missing children.'' The second NISMART study resolved some methodological challenges of the first study, and included runaway or throwaway children as well. 
   These studies have helped law enforcement, Federal agencies, and nonprofits in their work to prevent children from going missing or to help children get home. Missing children are some of our most vulnerable young people, and this work is critical in protecting this population. 
   This legislation works to help protect not only children who go missing, but it also works to protect our children who are sexually exploited, a horrendous thought for any of us to consider, and yet it is part of our reality. 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children serves not only as a national clearinghouse and resource center on missing children but also serves that same purpose for exploited children. Among multiple programs, NCMEC operates as a CyberTipline for tips and leads on child sexual exploitation. 
   The CyberTipline allows for citizens and electronic communication providers to report incidents of various types of child exploitation, including online enticement of children for sexual acts, child prostitution, and child pornography. This reauthorization expands the reach of the CyberTipline to include categories of exploitation that connect with new technologies or activities. 
   I want to share a success story from the Child Victim Identification Program at NCMEC. This program reviews child pornography to gain clues that will lead to the identification of a child. 
   In this particular case in 2005, those reviewing these horrendous images also found images of a young boy partially clothed, including a photo of him in his Boy Scout uniform. They were able to read the patches on his uniform and discovered he was in the Nassau County Boy Scout Council, which I represent here in this Congress. The program has set procedure which led them to contacting law enforcement, who identified this child and later arrested a suspect. 
   From this story, there are two points I want to make. First, this program does wonderful, and yet very difficult, work to protect and save children who are being exploited. Secondly, these crimes happen everywhere. 
   Since its inception in 1984, NCMEC has received 173 reports of missing children in Nassau County, New York, and 4,319 for New York State. Of those 4,319 children who went missing, 4,146 were recovered. 
   H.R. 2517 strengthens the ability of the Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and its programs, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to work to eradicate child pornography, guide efforts for online safety for children and unite families. These programs also support the work of law enforcement, including training law enforcement on multiple issues around missing, runaway, throwaway and sexually exploited children. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Marshals, the United States Postal Inspectors, and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement all have detainees at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   Until all children are safe from predators in our society, this work must continue and we must reauthorize the Missing Children's Assistance Act. 
   Before I close, I want to thank the staff who worked on this reauthorization: Abby Shannon in Mr. Lampson's office, Deborah Kookbeck, Ruth Friedman, Denise Forte of the majority staff of the Committee on Education and Labor, and Kirsten Duncan and Susan Ross on the minority staff of the Committee on Education and Labor. 
   H.R. 2517 is bipartisan effort and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank Mr. Lampson again for his leadership on this important reauthorization which works to keep our Nation's children safe. And I want to also thank my ranking member of the Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities, Mr. Platts, for his continued dedication to our work on the subcommittee. 
   I chair the Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities for the Committee on Education and Labor, and each member of this subcommittee is committed to helping the children of this Nation. 
   Our jurisdiction has led us to dealing with some of the most upsetting and challenging issues around the welfare of our Nation's children. And this reauthorization is no exception. 
   None of us would like to even think about any children in our lives, whether it's our own children, our grandchildren, our nieces or our nephews, any child in our lives going through missing or being sexually exploited. This is why this reauthorization is so critical and why this reauthorization is a bipartisan endeavor. 
   Through cooperation with the municipal Federal agencies, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children takes in an average of 258 calls per day to national hotlines. It has received 5,422 tips through the CyberTipline, and has worked with countless families and organizations to raise awareness and bring children to safety. This work would not have been possible without our work here today in reauthorizing the Missing Children's Assistance Act through H.R. 2517 sponsored by my colleague from Texas, Mr. Lampson. 
   I urge each Member to support this reauthorization. We, as a Nation, can do better to protect our children. And with that, I hope all of my colleagues will certainly vote for this.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report to the Higher Education Opportunity Act, H.R. 4137. 
   First, let me start out by thanking Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon. I also want to thank the staff for their professionalism and their courtesy and their work for getting this bill to where it is, and my own staff, Kim Becknell and Phil Putter. 
   The passage of this bill will help millions of Americans make the dream of a college education a reality.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report to the Higher Education Opportunity Act, H.R. 4137. 
   Let me first start out by thanking the Chairman, Ranking Member, and hardworking staff on the Committee on Education and Labor for their efforts and professionalism in passing one of the most comprehensive education bills in years.

   Expanding the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need program; 
   Expanding Project GRAD USA; 
   Monitoring our Nation's most expensive schools' tuition rates and offering students and families a tool to estimate increased costs over the course of a college education; 
   Studying the ability of teachers to meet the needs of students with dyslexia. 
   I am especially pleased that the bill addresses the need for colleges and universities to have policies in place to immediately warn their campus communities when a serious crime or other emergency threatens the safety of students or employees on campus. 
   These provisions are similar to those in my ``Virginia Tech Victims Campus Emergency Response Policy and Notification Act'' or VTV Act, H.R. 5735. 
   The tragic events of April 16, 2007, on the campus of Virginia Tech, reminded us that horrific incidents can happen anywhere and that we must be prepared. 
   The addition of an emergency notification provision to the Jeanne Clery Act will help ensure that students and employees are empowered with information about potential significant threats to their safety such as an unknown shooting suspect at large or an impending natural disaster. 
   Because emergencies can escalate or spread quickly it is vital that emergency notifications occur without any delay and these provisions appropriately provide that warnings must occur ``immediately ..... upon confirmation'' of a threat.  
   Minutes can mean the difference between life and death. 
   Using both high and low tech means, many institutions across the country, including Florida Atlantic University, Ferrum College and Northern Illinois University, have already adopted this approach and are issuing campuswide emergency notifications in less than 30 minutes after an incident has occurred. 
   These provisions will be a very fitting living memorial to the innocent victims of April 16, 2007 and I applaud their family members who have sought to have something positive come out of that dark day. The Virginia Tech Victims Family group members have been tireless advocates for safer campuses and their devotion has helped make these provisions a reality. I would ask that the victims' names be included at an appropriate place in the RECORD. 
   I would also like to thank Catherine Bath, Jonathan Kassa and S. Daniel Carter of the nonprofit organization Security On Campus, Inc., SOC, for their leadership on and help with these issues. Founded in 1987 by Connie Clery and her late husband Howard after their daughter Jeanne's murder in a campus residence hall, SOC continues to be the Nation's leading voice for safer campuses and victims' rights on campus. 
   To honor the memory of the lives that were lost as a result of the incident at Virginia Tech, I humbly submit the following names in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: 
   Ross Abdallah Alameddine, Christopher James Bishop, Brian Roy Bluhm, Ryan Christopher Clark, Austin Michelle Cloyd, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, Kevin P. Granata, and Matthew Gregory Gwaltney. 
   Caitlin Millar Hammaren, Jeremy Michael Herbstritt, Rachael Elizabeth Hill, Emily Jane Hilscher, Jarrett Lee Lane, Matthew Joseph La Porte, Henry J. Lee, and Liviu Librescu. 
   G.V. Loganathan, Partahi Mamora Halomoan Lumbantoruan, Lauren Ashley McCain, Daniel Patrick O'Neil, Juan Ramon Ortiz-Ortiz, Minal Hiralal Panchal, Daniel Alejandro Perez, and Erin Nicole Peterson.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD CELEBRATE NATIONAL GARDEN MONTH THROUGH A CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES OUTDOOR LEARNING -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Thank you for yielding. 
   I want to thank my good colleague, DEBORAH PRYCE, for working on this bill and introducing the bill. I want to certainly thank my colleague on the Education Committee, Representative Clarke from New York, also, for managing the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.Resolution 292. It is important for our schoolchildren to learn outside the classroom. 
   I am personally a gardener, and I hope that someday I'm actually going to become a master gardener. I also know that bringing my grandchildren into the garden and showing them, number one, how to grow things, and also the whole life of bugs, I know a lot of people might get a little squeamish about that, but to learn the science and to watch a praying mantis and to watch how they live and how the birds and the gardens work together, it is teaching our young children the wonders of the world. It also gets them interested in science. This world is a very complex place. 
   It is also extremely good for your mental health. I know that certainly with this job here, and all the years that I worked as a nurse, the first thing I went to was my garden when I got home. Just to put your hands in the soil, it gives you an immediate release of the tension that you might feel. So it is an activity that we are seeing more and more young people getting involved in. 
   I am happy to say that many of my schools on Long Island have gardens going around the school, number one, to beautify it, but also to teach the children how important gardening is. And growing vegetables. We find that children that grow their own vegetables actually enjoy eating vegetables a little bit more. 
   I certainly want my colleagues to vote for this. It is a good bill, and it is a good awareness for our young people.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT TO DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague Ms. Baldwin for her support, and I'd also like to thank my colleague from New York, Vito Fossella, for taking a strong stance on this issue. 
   I also want to say that this bill would not have made it to the floor without the help of my good friend and colleague, Congressman Pallone from New Jersey, for his support in bringing it up. 
   It was mentioned that Diamond-Blackfan anemia, or DBA, is a rare genetic bone marrow failure disorder that affects children and adults, stopping the body's ability to produce red blood cells. 
   A lot of our colleagues might remember, every year I go around and ask all of my colleagues to sign a book so that I can have the opportunity to teach my colleagues about DBA, so as we go down the road mostly hopefully to get more research money. 
   Ninety percent of those suffering this disease were younger than 1 year old when they were diagnosed. Children living with DBA have an increased risk of leukemia, solid tumors, and complete bone marrow failure. Fifty percent of patients with DBA are also born with birth defects, including abnormalities to the face, head, upper arm and hand, and heart. Twenty-one percent of affected patients suffer from more than one defect. 
   The individuals and families suffering from rare diseases such as DBA not only face the challenges of their life-threatening diseases, but they must also confront the limited treatment and the research options. 
   Researchers believe that the study of DBA will yield clues to several other widespread diseases, providing valuable insights into the biology of blood disorders, blood cell formation, leukemia, and serve as an important model for understanding the genetics of birth defects. 
   Unfortunately, many of the long-term treatments for DBA have the potential for serious side effects, including impaired growth, diabetes, and iron overload. 
   The only cure for DBA is a bone marrow transplant, a procedure that carries serious risks. And since most patients lack an acceptable donor, it's an option available for only about 25 percent of the patients.     
   Rare diseases, such as DBA, where there are no regional or ethnic trends and a small number of patients, make progress in treatment and research difficult. Thankfully, there are centers across the Nation that devote countless hours into understanding this disease. One such center is based out of my district on Long Island. The DBA Comprehensive Clinical Care Center at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, has become the hub for the care and treatment of DBA patients across the country. The facility is also home of the DBA Patient Registry, which has become a valuable national resource for families and the researchers. 
   The success made at Schneider's Children's Hospital have prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's DBA Public Health Outreach and Surveillance Program to establish three additional DBA centers in Texas, California, and Massachusetts to further patient access, information, treatment, and care by DBA experts. This has resulted in a doubling of patient care visits for DBA since their establishment. 
   The effects are also felt on a national level. The CDC has dedicated resources and manpower to the study of DBA as well as patient outreach. Because of these efforts, we have seen a 25 percent increase of enrollment of DBA patients into the DBA Patient Registry in the first 2 years of the program. The collaboration achieved through Federal programs such as NIH and the CDC and private groups such as the Daniela Maria Arturi Foundation and the DBA Foundation have driven the many recent successes in the DBA field. This partnership should serve as a model for addressing rare disease research efforts through close public and private manners. I have been working with the Arturi family for many years. Their daughter Daniela was affected by this rare disease, and they have been the vocal voices for increased funding for research and treatment. Today, we in Congress will give them and all families suffering from this rare disease a chance of hope. 
   Let me say that we hear constantly of these very rare diseases, and the families sometimes feel they have no hope. I would encourage them to reach out on the Internet to find the information they need to. The foundation that was started 10 years ago has come such a long way where researchers from across the world now come in for a conference every year to find out more and what work has been done. And even though the cure for DBA has not happened yet, the other research has helped many, many other families. So, please, join me in supporting this resolution and telling the families and the children with DBA that they are not alone. I ask my colleagues to support H. Res. 524.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Wexler and Ranking Member POE. 
   As the author of H.R. 222, I rise in support, as all of the members of the Friends of Ireland Caucus do. 
   This month, the peace process of Northern Ireland has an opportunity to make great strides. Several significant events are taking place this month. On March 7, new assembly elections were held. On March 14, new members for a power-sharing executive will be nominated. And, finally, on March 26, London will rescind direct rule and restore Northern Ireland's devolved government. 
   It has been a long road to get to this point, but restored progress has been made. Recently, Democratic Unionist Party leader Mr. Paisley, and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams spoke directly across the floor on the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some people will say this was a small matter. For those of us that have been involved in this issue, it was a great stand. 
   This dialogue is a major achievement in the ongoing peace process. However, there is still much work to be done, and this month is critical to ensure a successful devolution on March 26. 
   President Bush's Special Envoy on Northern Ireland has recognized the importance of this month's events and the need for Congress to help galvanize the momentum to achieve the March 26 deadline. 
   Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell believes a power sharing deal in Northern Ireland is now possible, following the March 7 assembly elections, but believes the U.S. still has a huge role to play in stimulating the investment and the trade in Northern Ireland. 
   With that in mind, I have introduced the Good Friday Agreement. This resolution shows Congress' support for the Good Friday Agreement, commends the efforts of Prime Minister Blair and Irish Taoiseach Ahern and all the parties for abiding by the St. Andrews Agreement. H. Res. 222 further encourages the parties to work in good faith to meet the Good Friday Agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to make a difference in Ireland by helping to make sure that we keep this momentum going. But I think, more important, when we see the troubles throughout the world today, Ireland has always been something that many of us here in Congress have been fighting for to bring both sides together. The people of Ireland want this peace process to go through. It is good for the whole nation. We here in Congress will be going as an envoy to Ireland during the Easter break, hopefully to be congratulating everybody and telling them we will do whatever we can to make sure the government stays up and running. But, more importantly, it is the people of Ireland that have overwhelmingly on both sides said, ``We want the peace process to go forward.''  
   I urge my colleagues to vote for peace in Northern Ireland and support H. Res. 222.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the Wichita State University women's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congressional Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship. On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University women's bowling team won the 2007 USBC Bowling National Championship Tournament by defeating Central Florida University in Wichita, Kansas. 
   I also want to congratulate head coach Gordon Vadakin, women's coach Mark Lewis, assistant women's coach Kristal Scott, athletic director Jim Schaus, Wichita State University president Donald L. Beggs and the student athletes on an excellent season. 
   After bowling eight events, the women's team played 362 games and knocked down 68,227 pins for an average score of 188.5 points. This was the eighth Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship for the Wichita State University women's bowling team and a record 31st appearance at the national tournament. The Shockers also had two juniors, Elysia Current and Emily Maier, named as First Team All-Americans, with Emily Maier being named to the All-Tournament team.  
   Winning the 2007 USBC Bowling National Championship Tournament and winning their eighth national title has revealed its excellent athletic program at Wichita State University to the Nation. I know the fans, students, and alumni of the university will remember this moment for many years to come. 
   Madam Speaker, once again I congratulate Wichita State University for their success.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION AWARENESS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week. 
   Bullying among children is aggressive behavior that is intentional and often repeated over time. It is estimated that 3.2 million students are bullied each year. These children that are victims of bullying often have a hard time defending themselves. They are the target of hitting, teasing, name-calling, intimidation and social exclusion. With the arrival of the digital age, bullying is taking place over e-mail in online communities such as MySpace and Facebook. 
   There is no single cause of bullying among school children. Several factors can make a child the target of aggressive bullying. What we do know is that students with disabilities and special needs are more often targeted by bullies. Overweight and obese children are also far more likely to be the victims of bullying. This weight-based teasing often causes body image issues with the children, sometimes leading to depression and even suicide. Bullying can often be a sign of serious antisocial behavior, and many children who bully are often dealing with issues in their home life. 
   We have all seen the horrors that can occur when bullying does go unchecked. The students at Columbine High School were the subjects of constant bullying. We are all aware of what happened when they reached their breaking point. 
   Congress cannot sit and wait for another tragedy to occur before we act. That is why I have introduced, with my colleague, today's resolution. The resolution recognizes this week as National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week, and commends the many programs and organizations that do great work in preventing the cycle of bullying. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Kuhl) for his work in working on this bipartisan agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to Congresswoman Linda S&#225;nchez from California, who has been working on this issue for many, many years.     
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, supporting the goals of National Bullying Prevention Week. It is time that we recognize that bullying is a serious problem and support our local communities in their attempts to address it. 
   Contrary to what is sadly still popular belief, bullying is neither a minor nuisance nor something to be laughed off. It is not a rite of passage, but instead an aggressive interference with a child's right to go to school, to learn, and to play in safety. Although any child may be bullied, some children face much greater risks than others. Children whom others perceive to be gay or lesbian are especially at risk, as are children who are obese. 
   Just what kind of dangers do these children face? Here are just two stories of students bullied on the basis of their sexual orientation. 
   One California student was recently subjected to verbal harassment and name-calling by students and teachers, spit on in school hallways, subjected to sexually suggestive touching, and even referred to an independent study program, as if the bullying and harassment were the victim's fault.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, we have heard some points about bullying in our schools across America. Recently, the Girl Scouts of America had actually done a survey. In my home district, they asked their Girl Scouts and their Brownies on addressing bullying and asked if any of them had participated in it. They were actually shocked at how many of their girls, Girl Scouts, actually participated in bullying. 
   I think that when we look at bullying today, it is an issue that teachers, parents, students themselves need to be educated on. With that, I am hoping that this resolution will go forward so people are aware. Bullying cannot be tolerated. It does hurt our young people. It certainly hurts their self-image. It is something that we need to face.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2894, the Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. 
   Let me start off by thanking the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Rupersberger for introducing this bill. 
   As school children we all learn about the War of 1812 as a turning point in our Nation's history that confirmed that the United States would remain a free and sovereign nation. 
   We also learn in school that, while being held by the British during the attack on Fort McHenry, just a few short miles from this building, Francis Scott Key was inspired after getting a glimpse at that tattered, but triumphant flag of our young Nation to compose a poem, which later became known as ``The Star Spangled Banner,'' our national anthem. 
   The symbol of the flag served as an inspiration to Francis Scott Key that night and has continued to inspire all Americans ever since. 
   Our flag was still there and is there still. 
   It is important that this Congress take this opportunity to recognize the historic significance of our national anthem and the battle from which it was born. 
   The Star Spangled Banner has inspired millions of patriotic Americans to take up the causes of our Nation in times of war and peace. 
   I know that many of my colleagues share the same sentiment with me when I say that every time I hear the opening notes of the Star Spangled Banner, I am personally nearly moved to tears. 
   That is why it is so important for us to commemorate the War of 1812 and the Star Spangled Banner by issuing a coin that will stand the test of time, much the same as the national anthem has. 
   I am in full support of this bill and ask that every Member of this Congress support it as well. 
   We can never be too patriotic. 
   We can never love our country too much. 
   And we can never do enough to commemorate the sacrifice that so many have given to protect our freedom. 
   This coin is one small gesture that we can offer to show our commitment to the values that are spoken about in our Nation's anthem: strength, honor, justice, patriotism, and courage. 
   Again, I encourage all my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S BUDGET ON NEW YORK -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the negative impact of President Bush's proposed budget on New York State. New York is consistently faced with a funding imbalance. We receive far less funding than we pay out in taxes. This imbalance has held back projects in key areas. Key programs have been constantly underfunded, and this year's proposed budget again makes the wrong choices for New York's families. Gang violence is a growing problem on Long Island. Our police departments and community groups are doing all they can with this small budget. 
   Unfortunately, these budgets will be further reduced if the President has his way. His budget request attempts to eliminate two of New York's local crime fighting tools: the Community Oriented Policing Service, or the COPS Program, and the Justice Assistance Grants Program. These two programs allow law enforcement agencies to hire police officers and support crime prevention. 
   It is a lot cheaper to prevent crime than it is to send someone to prison. Police departments rely on this money to purchase new technology and equipment, to educate their members on how to best combat issues such as gun violence. 
   In the year 2006, New York received more than $27 million in COPS and JAG funding. If this money is not available, our law enforcement will not have the tools they need to keep our families and communities safe. But it is not just our communities that are put at risk by the President's budget. 
   College assistance programs to help New York students will be slashed if the President has his way. The education of our Nation's students is one of the most important issues facing us today. I have traveled to China and India and have seen the attention those countries are giving to education for their students. 
   We need to do a better job at funding our educational programs to give our students the tools they need to compete in a global economy. However, under the President's budget, key programs such as work study and supplemental educational opportunity grants will be frozen. 
   Tuition in New York State schools have increased over 20 percent over the last few years. These new cuts in student aid will put college further out of reach of so many of the New York students. This is the wrong message to be sending to our students who work hard in high school and dream of going to college. We can do a better job, but we need adequate funding to truly help our students achieve their dreams. 
   As you know, our health care system needs attention also. Over 40 million  Americans are without health insurance. In New York 2.5 million are uninsured. In his State of the Union address, President Bush vaguely outlined a proposal to deal with this very issue. I applaud the President for bringing this issue to the forefront of the debate. 
   However, I do not agree with the President's plan. I am afraid his proposal will raise health care costs for New York's working class, while doing very little to help the 2.5 million uninsured. The money President Bush requested for his plan can be better used to lower premiums and truly make health care affordable for all Americans. 
   Since the start of the 110th Congress the House has done the people's work. We have raised the minimum wage, cut student loan interest rates, and helped Medicare beneficiaries. We have changed the focus of our Nation to help all Americans. 
   The President's budget request misses the mark and will harm already underfunded programs. We in Congress must devote more attention and funding to our Nation's education and health care. These issues have been long underfunded for too long. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to refocus our priorities and fully fund our educational and health care programs. I know in the next 3 days we are going to be debating Iraq, which I think is probably one of the most important issues facing this Nation. 
   But even with that, we as Democrats will continue doing the work of the American people and finally getting some work done that is going to help all Americans. That is what we as Democrats will do. That is what we pledged and we will follow through with that.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, our Nation is facing a serious backlog in the processing of passports. Since the new travel rules have been enacted, the number of Americans applying for a passport has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, the number of Foreign Service officers responsible for the processing of passport requests remains far below the necessary capacity. This discrepancy has led to long lines at passport offices nationwide and extended processing times. 
   During the summer months, travel typically increases to and from the United States. To assist U.S. residents with the passport backlogs, I have introduced H.R. 2845, a bill that allows for an increase in Foreign Service officers trained to handle passport requests. My good friend from New York, Senator Schumer, successfully moved similar legislation through the Senate, which we will be voting on today. 
   I am encouraged to see the House act on this important and time sensitive issue and am hopeful the President will quickly sign S. 699 to help alleviate the tremendous passport backlogs facing our constituents.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I will support H.R. 1908 with some reservations. 
   Our patent laws need to be updated to address the concerns of a 21st Century global economy. For decades, the law has reacted to innovation rather than anticipating it. H.R. 1908 contains many positive provisions that will make it easier for us to compete. I, therefore, want the process to move forward. 
   The American economy is strong in part because it is diverse. We do not depend on only one segment for our income. Some countries grow crops. Others rely on tourism. Still other countries depend on finite natural resources. Some specialize in manufacturing or providing specific services. We are fortunate enough to  be able to conduct all these businesses and more. 
   A revised patent law must protect and encourage all segments of our economy. We cannot favor high tech over manufacturing. We cannot discourage biotech research while encouraging financial services. 
   If our economic foundation remains strong and diversified, we will be able to retain our preeminent role in the world's economy. However, if our patent laws inhibit invention and innovation in manufacturing and basic research, then we would be undermining the very strength of our national economy. 
   As the legislative process continues, I hope that the authors of H.R. 1908 and the members of the other body will remember one important point. The purpose of our patent law is to protect and promote American innovation. Innovation by Americans and for Americans is the keystone to our domestic economic vitality and strength. 
   The final version of patent reform must address the legitimate interests of manufacturing, biotech, and small inventors. My vote on a final patent reform bill will depend on how well those interests are met.

   I have spent over 30 years as a nurse, and it was mentioned earlier, someone said, Once a nurse. Well, let me say, Once a nurse, always a nurse. We carry our duties even here to the House of Representatives. 
   I sit on the Education Committee, and what I have been working on since I came here was making sure that our nurses get every opportunity to increase our numbers. As has been mentioned before by both of my colleagues, the nursing shortage in this country is of a crisis proportion. We see that our nurses today are a lot older; they're at the retirement age, and we must do everything that we can to make sure that we have our young people coming into a very, very rewarding career. Nursing can be demanding, it can be tiring, it can be physically draining; but it couldn't be a better career. 
   When I first joined nursing over 30 years ago, I worked in the intensive care unit, and I spent most of my life there and just to be able to help a patient in their greatest need but also to work with their families to comfort them as they saw their loved one going through a traumatic injury. 
   We need to make sure that this country has a supply of nurses continuously. We have many young people that want to go to nursing school, but what we have found over the years is we don't have enough professors to be able to teach them to be nurses. So in the Higher Education Act, there is going to be funding in there to make sure that those that want to go into a higher education to be able to teach nursing, it can work out for us. 
   When we look at the future, we're seeing today in our hospitals such a shortage of nurses that a lot of the nurses are doing a lot of overtime. When they take a day off, they're always called to come back in. That is not acceptable, mainly because you have to be totally alert at all times. And I certainly tip my hat to my fellow nurses that go through this every single day. 
   They stay in the profession because they love the profession. They stay in the profession because it is a calling. Not everyone can be a nurse. It is a calling. I salute those men and women that go into nursing, and I also salute the women and men that are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and taking their nursing care to the soldiers and giving them comfort when they need it. There is no greater, in my opinion, profession than to be a nurse. 
   With that being said, I hope my colleagues will support H. Res. 1086 and recognize National Nurses Week.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (NICS IMPROVEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, a few minutes ago, H.R. 2640 was passed in this House. This legislation was passed in the year 2002. Late this afternoon, the Senate passed H.R. 2640, which is the NICS bill. 
   Madam Speaker, this is something that I have been working on for over 11 years to try to reduce gun violence in this Nation. I'm happy to say that, with working with the NRA, the Brady Center, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Coburn from Oklahoma and Mr. Schumer from New York, we have finally come together to pass legislation which, in my opinion, is going to save many lives. 
   This particular piece of legislation, which many of my constituents and people around the country that watch this know that I've been talking about at least once a week for the last number of years, to me, this is the best Christmas present I could ever receive. 
   Two weeks ago was the 14th anniversary of my husband's death, and five others. My husband and son were coming home from work, and unfortunately my husband was killed and my son was seriously injured. And it was down the road that my son was recovering that I promised him that I would do all I could to help a family not go through what myself and many other families go through, unfortunately, on a daily basis. And that day has come. 
   We have seen the Virginia Tech shootings. We have seen the shootings in other parts of the country in the last few weeks. This bill can help save lives, but it also shows that when opposite sides work together, which we should all be doing here in this Congress for the American people, we can do some good. 
   As I said earlier, I worked with the NRA and I worked with the Brady Center, and we came together with an understanding of putting our differences aside to work out a good piece of legislation. This is a proud moment for Congress. This is a proud moment for the American people to see how we can work together. 
   I know that there are many on both sides of the issue that feel that some of us are just trying to take away their right to own guns. That has not ever been my intention. I have always just wanted to have gun safety issues put forth so we could save people's lives. This piece of legislation, the NICS Improvement Act, will do that. 
   There was a little confusion going back that we were going to be hurting our veterans . That is not true. Working with Mr. Coburn, and certainly Mr. Dingell, we have shown that it is not going to take away the right of our veterans coming home to be able to own a gun. We have clarified the language so that there is no misunderstanding. 
   I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue on how we can reduce gun violence in this country because the more we can reduce gun violence, hopefully we can also cut down the 30,000 people that die every year. 
   I had mentioned last week that since I've been in Congress, 330,000 people have died. That's not counting the amount of people that are injured every single year and what it does for the health care costs of this Nation. When we spend over $2 billion a year on health care costs for those that survive, there is something wrong.     
   I am hoping that down the road I can continue to work with the NRA and continue working with the Brady Center to come up with commonsense solutions on how we can save lives without getting into the rhetoric of us trying to take away their guns or guns don't kill. That is not the debate. The debate is how are we going to keep the guns away from people that shouldn't be able to own guns. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish everybody a merry Christmas. This will save lives, and this is devoted to the victims that have been hurt over these many years.  
   I'd like to thank my good friend Congressman DINGELL for all of his hard work in making this moment a reality. I'd also like to thank my friend Senator SCHUMER for carrying this legislation through the Senate. 
   Today is five years in the making. 
   On March 12, 2002, a senseless shooting took the lives of a priest and a parishioner, Mrs. Tosner, at the Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York. The man who committed this double murder had a disqualifying mental health condition and a restraining order against him, but passed a background check because his personal history was not entered into the NICS database. 
   This same scenario happens every day. 
   The shooter in the Virginia Tech massacre was prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Unfortunately, flaws in the NICS system allowed his record to slip through the cracks.  
   He was able to purchase two handguns, and used them to brutally murder thirty two individuals. We saw this trend continue last week with shootings in Nebraska and Colorado. 
   Individuals who shouldn't have access to guns are getting them with ease are our killing innocent people. 
   The NICS system is supposed to prevent this from happening, but a database is only as good as the information put in it and many states don't have the resources to keep the NICS database up to date. 
   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is deeply flawed. 
   Millions of criminal records are not accessible by ICS and millions others are missing critical data, such as arrest dispositions, due to data backlogs.The primary cause of delay in NICS background checks is the lack of updates due to funding and technology issues in the states. 
   Many states have not automated the records concerning mental illness, restraining orders, or misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence. Simply, put, the NICS system must be updated on both the state and federal level. 
   According to a Third Way report, over ninety one percent of those adjudicated for mental illness cannot be stopped by a background check due to flaws in the system. But this issue allows other barred individuals to purchase firearms. Twenty five percent of felony convictions do not make it into the NICS system. 
   That is why I introduced the NICS Improvement Act. 
   My bill would require all states to provide the NICS system with the relevant records needed to conduct effective background checks. It is the state's responsibility to ensure this information is current and accurate. They must update the records to ensure violent criminals do not have access to firearms. 
   However, I recognize, many state budgets are already overburdened. 
   This legislation would provide grants to states to update their records into the NICS system. States would get the funds they need to make sure records relevant to NICS are up to date. 
   While the NICS system does have major flaws, it is responsible for preventing thousands of barred individuals from purchasing firearms. 
   Approximately nine-hundred and sixteen thousand individuals were prohibited from purchasing a firearm for failing a background check between November 30, 1998, when the NICS system began operating, and December 31, 2004. 
   During this same period, nearly forty nine million Brady background checks were processed through NICS. By improving upon the NICS system, we can stop criminals from falling through the cracks. Today, we are one step closer to bringing the records of millions of barred individuals into the NICS system. 
   No system will be perfect, but that does not mean we should not work to make improvements. This is good policy that will save lives and should be passed by the House. My legislation imposes no new restrictions on gun owners and does not infringe on the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. In fact, similar legislation passed the House in 2002. 
   Today, Congress will stand up for the victims and pass common-sense legislation. This is the best Christmas present Congress could give those whose lives have been changed by gun violence. 
   This legislation will help ensure that people who are legally ineligible to purchase a gun will not be able to purchase them. 
   This bill poses no new burden on law-abiding gun owners or gun sellers. It simply enforces current law. This legislation has the widest range of support imaginable. The National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign have endorsed this legislation. 
   We have worked across both partisan and ideological aisles to make this bill law. The cooperation from members of both parties and from people on both sides of the gun issue should serve as a model for this Congress. 
   We can work together to find common sense solutions to our problems. These problems shouldn't divide us, but bring us together to make our country a safer and better place. 
   Personally, this is a very important moment for me. I have been fighting for common sense gun laws for 14 years since my own life was changed forever by gun violence. 
   Tonight, I'm one step closer to the goal of making sure other families never have to experience what mine did 14 years ago. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this issue that is so important to me and other Americans whose lives have been affected by gun violence.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Chairman, I would first like to congratulate the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Oberstar; the subcommittee chairwoman, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON; and the sponsor of the bill, Mr. Pallone, for bringing forth such important legislation. The bill will help ensure that our beaches are safe for swimming as we enter the summer months. 
   Today, I will be offering an amendment to H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, in order to raise awareness of Congress about the presence of pharmaceuticals in our Nation's drinking water. We must begin to better understand this important issue. 
   At the end of the debate, I intend to withdraw this amendment. 
   A recent Associated Press study brought to life the fact that pharmaceutical products have been found in the drinking water supply of at least 41 million Americans. In my State of New York, health officials found heart medicine, infection fighters, estrogen, mood stabilizers and tranquilizers in Upstate water supply. Six pharmaceuticals were found in the drinking water right here in Washington, D.C. 
   We don't know how the pharmaceutical enters into the water supply. But it's likely that some medications that are not fully absorbed by the body may have passed into the water through human waste. In some other cases, unused pills may have simply been flushed down the toilet. 
   Additionally, some agricultural products and medications may have run off into the groundwater supply. 
   In addition to antibiotics and steroids, EPA has identified over 100 individual pharmaceuticals and personal care products in environmental samples and drinking water. Wastewater treatment plants appear to be unable to completely remove pharmaceuticals from the water. The presence of the pharmaceuticals in the water raises serious questions about the effects on human health and wildlife. 
   My amendment would require EPA to conduct a study on the presence and source of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in coastal recreation waters. 
   Pharmaceuticals and personal care products include prescription and over-the-counter therapeutical drugs, veterinary drugs, fragrances, lotions, and cosmetics, as well as products used to enhance growth or health of livestock. The report will be used as part of the government efforts to better understand the effects pharmaceuticals in our waters have on human health and aquatic wildlife. 
   Unfortunately, I recognize that this bill is not in the proper venue to adequately address safe drinking water. Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment shortly. 
   Instead, I am drafting a stand-alone legislation on this issue and will call for congressional hearings so that we can better understand the problems associated with pharmaceuticals in our Nation's drinking water supply. 
   We need to know how the pharmaceuticals are entering the water supply, how much is in the water, what are the effects of human health and adequate plant life, what is the best way to dispose of pharmaceuticals, and how should we treat water that has been contaminated with pharmaceuticals and personal care products. 
   It is vital that Congress take up and champion the cause of keeping our coastal recreation and drinking water safe. This is a public health issue. And we must act before the presence of pharmaceuticals reaches crisis levels. 
   Congresswoman Richardson, will the committee work with me on legislation to address the presence of pharmaceuticals and other care products in our Nation's water supply and help further our understanding of the effects on the human health and wildlife?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Chairman, I want to start by saying congratulations to Chairman Miller on this important day and thank him for his strong leadership over the many years that this has been an issue for him. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Miller and the committee staff for working with me on this important legislation. When we started working on this issue in the committee, I became outraged over the testimony we heard. You see, children are dying. 
   I cannot forget the testimony of Bob Bacon, father of Aaron Bacon. Bob and his wife Sally were seeking the best alternative for their son, Aaron, who was struggling. They talked with therapists, counselors, pastors, and doctors, and were referred by friends to a particular program. They read, and I quote, in their very compelling brochure, spoke with the office on the phone, and met with the owners for a personal interview and chose this particular program for their son. They felt that the owners were caring people who had experience in counseling kids who were struggling with drugs and peer pressure. 
   He continued on in his testimony to our committee: ``Of course, being normal, trusting, and honest people ourselves, we assumed we were being told the truth.'' They were not. 
   I will never forget the pain in the father's eyes when he told us that he regretted being talked into using the program's escort service, and here is why: At 5 a.m., Bob's son, Aaron, was taken from his bed under the threat of physical force if he resisted. Aaron was not permitted to speak to Bob or Sally, his mother, or father. His parents managed to hug him and tell him that it was for the best. The van backed out of the driveway, and Bob told us the pleading eyes of his son which begged them not to send him away haunt them today. They never spoke again. 
   Aaron died in the wilderness with the program's staff claiming he was faking the entire time. Aaron begged to be seen by a doctor. The criminal investigation illuminated 21 days, 21 days of physical and psychological abuse and neglect that Aaron experienced. There is no excuse for this. 
   This and many other stories are the cause of my outrage, and we should all  be outraged. There were many stories and testimony from parents that came to our committee and talked to us, but here is the bottom line. There are some good residential programs out there that are for the treatment of our young people that have problems. But the majority, I have to say, they go from State to State to State. When they close down in one State, they open up in another State, and they use their same abusive practices. 
   This is America. These are our most vulnerable children. And yes, as far as I'm concerned, it is a Federal duty to protect these children because these camps do go from State to State. And we should at least be able to give the parents the tools that they need to make sure that their children are getting the treatment and the care that they were promised. 
   I hope that this bill passes. I hope that those in Congress understand because only because we never know if that's going to happen to one of our children in our families or our grandchildren, and we want to make sure that we have the information that is out there to make sure that our children get the treatment that they need. 
   Chairman Miller, I thank you for bringing this forward. I hope this goes forward. I hope we can protect the children of this country. I hope that we can set standards for the many camps around this country that unfortunately do not do what they say to help the children.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (TAKING CARE OF AMERICA'S VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, it has been a great comfort to listen to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about National Bible Week. The Bible can bring great comfort to all of us, especially in time of need. And when I look at the legislation that we have been trying to pass and legislation that is coming forward, I hope we can all remember the words of the Bible and take care of each other and not the almighty dollar. 
   Mr. Speaker, next week is November 11th. We remember those who answered the call when America needed them most. Honoring our veterans reminds us that our freedoms come at a cost and with liberty comes responsibility. Congress has a responsibility to take care of the men and women who are serving and who have served. This year we passed legislation to increase the VA budget by $6.7 billion above last year's level. This is the largest single increase in veterans funding in the history of the VA. This increase will help better serve the health care needs of our veterans, both young and old, by providing over 1,000 new VA caseworkers to reduce the unacceptable delays in receiving their benefits. 
   Our young veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with new injuries. We have seen a dramatic rise in traumatic brain injuries due to IEDs and roadside bombs. As of January, over 2,000 of our brave men and women have been diagnosed with TBI. These veterans need a high level of intensive care when they return from battle. 
   I understand the issues our soldiers who come home with TBI face. That is why I worked with Defense Subcommittee Chairman Murtha to include language in the Department of Defense authorization that sets aside funding and support for TBI treatment. 
   We are in a new century and the members of our Armed Forces, our veterans and their loved ones, need a new GI Bill. A new GI Bill should increase funding for veterans' medical care; employment assistance for our homeless veterans throughout this country; increased pay for our active duty members, so they can actually have a family life; expand current benefits under the current Montgomery GI Bill. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2702, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act. This legislation provides education assistance for our young veterans returning home from the war under the Montgomery GI Bill. 
   In addition to increased funding for a new GI Bill, there needs to be other substantive changes made to veterans care. There should be a guaranteed funding stream for veterans health care. Access to health care should improve and there should be increased funding for special VA programs such as posttraumatic stress disorder treatment, homelessness, long-term care. 
   We must also address the problem called concurrent receipt. Currently other Federal retirees get both disability and retirement pay. But we deny our veterans this privilege because of an outdated law. 
   Congress must authorize full payment of both retirement pay and disability compensation to more than hundreds of thousands of disabled veterans and military retirees. 
   What we need to do is keep the promises we made to our veterans. I am hoping Congress in the coming days, months, and years will take care of these promises. We owe this to the American people. We owe it to our young people that sign up to fight the wars that we are fighting. If we don't keep our promises, why should our young people join to keep this country secure? 
   I salute our veterans, thank them for their service, and say God bless America.

   Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1288, supporting the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety Awareness Month. 
   Each year since 2005 the national non-profit organization Security On Campus, Inc. has designated September as National Campus Safety Awareness Month. 
   Security On Campus partners with colleges and universities across the country each year to offer important campus safety programming during National Campus Safety Awareness Month in September. 
   I am pleased to have worked with Security on Campus on a provision in the Higher Education bill dealing with timely safety notifications on college campuses. 
   This year 350 campuses will formally partner with Security on Campus to offer campus safety activities as a part of National Campus Safety Awareness Month. 
   This programming covers critical issues including sexual assault, high risk drinking, and hazing, which are among the most serious safety issues facing our Nation's campuses. 
   September, at the beginning of the new school-year, is an ideal time to reach out to new and returning students, many of whom are on their own for the first time. 
   I applaud Security on Campus as a leading voice on behalf of students and parents for safer college and university campuses, and their partners for offering this life-saving program. 
   As a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 1288, I would also like to thank Congressman SESTAK for introducing the resolution. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Chairman, in recent years, the GOP-led Congress significantly cut investments for priorities in the Labor-HHS-Education bill. This year, the President has once again proposed significant cuts to programs of $7.6 billion below 2007 levels. This is the wrong message and the wrong policy for America. 
   My colleagues and I are determined to reverse the funding cuts put forth over the past several years. This bill rejects most of the President's damaging cuts and provides an increase of $4.3 billion (or 3 percent) over the 2007 funding levels. The bill makes college more affordable--including increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $390. The bill helps raise the achievement levels of America's students, providing $2 billion increase above 2007 and $1 billion above the President's request for No Child Left Behind programs. 
   H.R. 3043 expands access to health care for the uninsured by investing in initiatives that will provide for new and innovative ways to reduce costs while expanding coverage. This legislation provides $200 million for community health centers, enabling these centers to serve an additional 1 million uninsured Americans. The bill provides $75 million for a new initiative of state health access grants, providing start-up grants to states that are ready with plans to expand health care coverage to targeted groups. It also includes $50 million for an initiative to assist states in providing insurance pools to support affordable insurance for almost 200,000 people who are medically high-risk. 
   H.R. 3043 meets the domestic healthcare and education needs of our Nation. For too long, Congress has ignored the needs of the American people. Today, I will move with my colleagues in a new direction to fully fund the vital healthcare and education programs utilized by the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Shuster for their work on this bill. 
   My district is located in a densely populated area on Long Island, New York. We have the comfort and convenience of rail transportation to New York City by the Long Island Railroad. The Long Island Railroad moves safely through the Fourth Congressional District with the use of locomotive horns at train crossings. 
   Although the use of horns at train crossings ensures the safety of the surrounding communities, horn noise also has a substantial impact on the quality of life of individuals living in those communities. 
   For example, in Cedarhurst, New York, there are five train crossings  within a half mile. Because the crossings are so close together, the result is a continuous horn blast as the train moves through the community. The horn noise can be so loud and last so long that individuals must stop any ongoing conversations for several minutes. This happens most often during rush hour, but continues approximately 50 times throughout the day. Individuals find it difficult to sleep through the horn noise, even with the use of earplugs, and are awakened early in the morning and late in the evening. Also, because my district is so densely populated, the horn noise bounces off many of the buildings nearest the railroad and seems to intensify as it moves through the community. 
   I support the Federal Railroad Administration and its primary goal of ensuring the safety of railroads and trains across the country and in the Fourth Congressional District of New York. I do not and will not support any measure that will reduce the safety of railroads and trains coming through my community. 
   With that in mind, I also understand the effect of locomotive noise that does interfere with the quality of life. I have received countless letters and e-mails from my constituents expressing how noise affects their daily lives. 
   Due to the impact that locomotive horn noise has on the communities in my district, I support the language in the manager's amendment that allows the Secretary to consider the impact of horn noise on the local community and the unique characteristics of the community that it is serving in considering applications for waivers or exemptions. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for working with me on this issue and allowing me the time to express my support for his amendment and the bill.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5876, STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee and I stand in support of the rule. I want to say thank you to Chairman Miller and the committee staff for working with me on this important legislation, and for Mr. Miller's personal leadership on this issue over the years. 
   When we started working on this issue in committee, I became outraged over the testimony that I was hearing. You see, children in this country are dying. In fact, the Government Accountability Office report found thousands of cases of abuse and neglect at residential programs for teens. The abuses include staff members forcing children to remain in so-called ``stress'' positions for hours at a time and to undergo extreme physical exertion without food, water or rest. 
   Sadly, in a number of cases this abuse has led to the deaths of children at the hands of the very people entrusted with their care. 
   These are basic human rights being denied to our children, children who are already struggling to find their way in this world, children who might suffer from mental disorders or other conditions that make daily living in society much more challenging than for other kids their own age, children whose parents love them and want the best for them and need help in addressing the needs of these vulnerable youth. 
   Parents, often desperate for help, feeling vulnerable as well, are sending their children to facilities that are sold as safe and responsible facilities. 
   The GAO's investigative work is showing that a number of programs use deceptive marketing practices to appeal to parents. In fact, it uncovered deception, fraud, and conflicts of interest. In one scheme, a husband owns a referral service and the wife owned a residential treatment facility. It was revealed that her location received more referrals from her husband's service than any other providers. 
   Parents are sold a bill of goods about the facilities and are enticed by advertising schemes portraying these programs as safe, with a professional staff, and high-quality environments for their children. 
   Yet it is too often not true, and tragically, at times, the end result is the death of a child. 
   That's why it is absolutely crucial that we make sure that children are kept safe when they are in these facilities by setting minimum safety standards. Minimum; why are we even setting them at minimum? 
   You know, it seems like every week I am up here on the floor talking about how we need to protect our children. That's why it is absolutely crucial that we establish standards and stop ``boot camps'' from using the kind of deceptive marketing that has drawn in so many parents. 
   I am pleased that the bill contains some aspects to address all deceptive marketing tactics employed by some owners or operators of residential treatment facilities. 
   One section requires that all printed material from the facility include a link to a Web site that has a database about past incidents and violations. We do that with our college students so parents can actually look to see how safe that particular college is. And yet we are having a hard time trying to do this for children who need our help immensely, and the parents. The parents  are facing difficult choices to do whatever they can to help their child. And yet they are given false information. 
   Another section specifies that a new Web site include not just the name and location of each facility, but also the owner and operator of the facility so the parents can watch out for the bad operators. 
   Furthermore, even though we did not include language requiring all promotional and informational materials distributed by the facilities be subject to appropriate guidelines, such as those specified by the Federal Trade Commission Act due to jurisdictional issues, we will continue to monitor the deceptive marketing practices on these programs. 
   Madam Speaker, we need minimum safety standards for these public and private residential treatment facilities. It is past time to bring these programs to a level of basic safety which protects children and prevents further abuse from happening. 
   I promise--and I am positive that Chairman Miller will, too--we will continue to work on this. But as with a lot of things that come through our committee, we have to work with both sides so we can get a bill through and passed and on its way to the President. But I have to say in cases like this, I wish we could have gone further to protect the children, to protect the parents. I urge passage of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership on this issue, as well as the ranking member, Mr. Hunter. 
   If you look back at what happened at Walter Reed, and it is on the outside of the care, not the inside care of the hospital that we are talking about, the Wounded Warriors Act certainly is a good first step. 
   One of the things that I want to address, I want to say thank you to Chairman Murtha for the commitment he has made to our military as far as making sure the money is in there so that we can implement what we need to do. 
   As we all know, head trauma has become the focus of a lot of these veterans that are coming home. With the IEDs in Iraq, traumatic brain injury has become the signature wound of this conflict. Our soldiers receive outstanding acute medical care; but people have to understand, it used to be thought that after 6 months of treatment, someone with a head injury would be fine and they would just kind of let them go. That is not true. 
   Back in 1993, my son was shot in the head and he certainly sustained very traumatic head injury. It takes a long time, and we know that we can give treatment for years after. It is 13 years since my son's head treatment, and he is still receiving therapy. So this is a good first start, and I hope we continue with it.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Chairman, I think there are obviously many of us that support H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. In listening to the debate, I can only talk about a number of the schools that are in my district. I'm certainly someone who supports school funding for IDEA, but if I have my children in the classrooms--or most of them are actually being taught in the hallways because they don't have the facilities to be able to do the teaching that they need to do. I know a number of my schools--if that was a business, you wouldn't be able to get anybody to work into that particular business. 
   What we're trying to do--and you have to look at things holistically. If we don't have good school facilities, how do we expect our teachers and certainly our students to learn, and what kind of message are we sending that we don't care enough about our children that we give them safe environments? 
   I can go into my schools in my district during the winter, and every window is wide open because the way the energy for the heating system is, it makes the classrooms too hot. The children can't concentrate. You go into one of my schools during the summertime when they're taking their final exams, and the classrooms are 110 degrees. How are our students supposed to be able to pass those tests and concentrate? None of us would work under those conditions. And yet we are asking our children to survive under those conditions. 
   We must look at how we're going to work to be able to educate our children for the global economy that we're looking forward to. But I believe very, very strongly we have to have a clean, safe environment. Go into our city schools. Come into my schools. Look at the amount of children that have asthma because the quality of the air is subnormal. A number of my schools in the last year had to be closed. So now we're putting our children in little trailers. 
   I don't understand this debate. This is something that many of our schools need, and as far as having Davis-Bacon, why should not we have prevailing wage for those that work in the community, pay the wages, and also have good construction done? 
   With that, I hope that we pass overwhelmingly this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   I stand in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. Our Nation's future is in our education, and we must ensure our students have access to affordable higher education that will prepare them to excel in the global economy. I want to thank Chairman Miller and his staff for all the hard work that they did to get this bipartisan bill out of committee and to the floor and also to Ranking Member McKeon. I would also like to thank the chairman for including some key priorities of mine. 
   The legislation authorizes Project GRAD USA as an ongoing Federal program. This national program has successfully increased the number of low-income students to attend college and earn degrees. We are also providing opportunities for nurses as our Nation faces a severe nursing shortage by creating programs to increase the number of nursing students and nurse educators. Degrees also from rabbinical schools which will be able to continue to be recognized at the equivalency of a bachelor's degree. 
   We all understand the need for increased campus security. This legislation will improve current campus safety policies to ensure students are protected and will include improvements to emergency response policies and whistle-blower protections for students. 
   Career and technical schools will offer a great alternative to traditional 4-year colleges and are especially helpful to students in my district. 
   By passing this bill, we will improve current law for career colleges and technical school students by providing students with more opportunity to attend these vital institutions and enter the global economy with marketable skills.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a great day for national service. It has been 15 years since we reauthorized our national service laws. As chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I am pleased to speak in support of H.R. 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act. 
   I am also pleased to say that the administration and the service community support the GIVE Act. I would like to thank Chairman Miller for his continued strong support and work on this reauthorization. I would also like to extend my thanks to the ranking member of our committee, Mr. McKeon, for his hard work. 
   Finally, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Platts, for his work on this reauthorization. 
   Later I will speak on my manager's amendment, which is also a bipartisan effort. National service has a distinguished and strong history in our Nation. The benefits of service cannot be disputed. Evidence shows that service and volunteering lowers school dropout and crime rates, lowers costs associated with the aging population, and improves health among the elderly. 
   Volunteering is a cost-effective way of working to solve the challenges facing our Nation today. That is why the passage of the GIVE Act is necessary. One of the most effective volunteer organizations in this Nation is AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps volunteers offer a range of services focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities. Our legislation recognizes their invaluable work and increases the number of participants to 100,000. 
   The GIVE Act also encourages programs to recruit underrepresented populations to serve, including scientists and engineers, young people in our aging-out foster care, children at risk of delinquency, and other disadvantaged young people. 
   I truly believe that expanding national service, particularly to disadvantaged youth, is an effective way to combat things like youth gangs and violence, and the evidence bears it out.     
   If we are serious about reducing gang violence, we must take the first step and offer children an alternative. 
   This legislation creates a Summer of Service program which gives middle school and high school students an opportunity to become engaged in a positive way within their community. Through the Summer of Service program, our Nation's young people will have a chance to serve with others their own age while improving their community. 
   Research shows that if students are engaged in service at an early age, they continue to serve throughout their life. 
   We are strengthening the mission of the first responder volunteer program, the National Civil Community Corps by requiring more intense disaster and emergency relief training during down periods in order to be better prepared in a time of crisis. 
   We are all aware of what our Nation faced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the NCCC was there to respond, and continues to recover today. 
   The GIVE Act will help our Nation become better prepared for future disasters by training and preparing more emergency volunteers. The GIVE Act creates in the corporation an office of outreach and recruitment. The new office will establish a reserve corps made up of those who have gone through the program and are alumni. The reserve corps alumni will be called on during emergencies, disasters, or other times of national need. 
   We've heard people asking over and over again during our hearings, why aren't we using former volunteers? The new outreach office will work to connect over 500,000 former volunteers who can be resources for recruitment. 
   The GIVE Act lowers the age of participation in the National Senior Service to 55 years old. By lowering the age, we are encouraging retiring Americans to participate in national service and giving older Americans the opportunity to lead us into the future. Our Nation's retiring and retired adults are a rich resource that cannot be overlooked. 
   Every American, old and young, has skills that improve the day-to-day functions of our society. The GIVE Act encourages individuals to get involved, creates a deeper commitment to service, and makes our Nation more like what it should be. 
   I want to again thank Chairman Miller for his deep commitment to national service, Ranking Member McKeon and Congressman Platts for their work with us on this bipartisan activity. And I urge my colleagues to support this much needed legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we have been working through this bill, through our hearings and everything else, and listening to the volunteers that work in AmeriCorps and other aspects of volunteering, and also listening to our young people from communities that are underserved on how they want to serve and be part of it, before my colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) talked about how we've done away with summer jobs. We see in our communities today more and more of our young people joining gangs and getting into trouble. We see that our juvenile justice system and our prisons are being overflowed, unfortunately, with young people. This is a program that can help them. 
   You know, I look at our country and I marvel at how people volunteer and give their time to help other people that are in need. With the programs that we're putting forth and through the work of the subcommittee and  through the work of my colleague Mr. Platts from Pennsylvania, we have put together a great bill. This is a bill that can help people to the future. This is a bill that incorporates our elderly and our young. So, it's something that I think we should all be proud of. And certainly I'm hoping that we're not going to have any controversies further down the line. 
   And may I just say one thing: A number of speakers have gotten up and talked about the FISA bill. Let me say this to the American people: With the continuation that we have, this country is being protected. And we are trying to work it out with our colleagues from the other side and the administration. But let me make one thing very clear, the country is being protected. The intelligence committees can do what they need to do, and our intelligence community is getting information at that. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to the manager's amendment to H.R. 2857, Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act. 
   As chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I am pleased to offer a bipartisan manager's amendment to H.R. 2857. I am also pleased to say that the administration and the service community support the GIVE Act. 
   I would like to again thank Chairman Miller for his continued support  and work on this reauthorization. I would also like to extend my thanks to the ranking member of our committee, Mr. McKeon, for his work. Finally, I would like to thank the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Platts, for his work on this reauthorization. 
   I also would like to thank the staff who have worked many hours on the bill. For the majority, Deborah Koolbeck, Denise Forte, and Alexander Ceja, and for the minority, Brad Thomas and Susan Ross. 
   This amendment increases the ability of the Corporation for National and Community Service to tap into the pool of potential volunteers, which gives us a better opportunity to meet challenges facing our Nation's communities today. 
   Some of the changes in the manager's amendment include: the amendment improves the reach and capacity of the Summer of Service. This program is aimed to increase civil responsibility and community service among 5th-12th graders through summer service-learning programs. Getting younger kids involved in service is a good investment. Studies show that the earlier we get folks involved in the volunteer service the more likely they will stay in for their lifetime. 
   We have improved the National Civilian Conservation Corps, or the NCCC. This valuable program has a focus on disaster preparation. NCCC and volunteers have helped during disasters like Katrina. Because of the disaster focus, there is a need for supervisors and training instructors with a background in law enforcement, rescue and emergency and disaster preparedness. The amendment allows retired law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel to be part of the management of the NCCC. 
   My amendment makes the Retired Senior Volunteer Program a competitive grant program by 2013. I believe competition spurs innovation, and this will strengthen the program. 
   Also included in this amendment are incentive grants for the Senior Corps program. These grants are designed to bolster the capacity of current exceptional Senior Corps programs. 
   Given that the RSVP program is becoming a competitive process, it is expected that the RSVP programs which meet the eligibility requirements will be a majority of incentive grant applicants and recipients. 
   Finally, I have also worked with Mr. Altmire, Mr. Sestak, and Mr. Souder and have included changes that they suggested in the manager's amendment. I want to thank them for their great ideas. 
   Our national service laws were last authorized 15 years ago. We have worked with our colleagues across the aisle and with the service community to renew the spirit of service in our Nation through the GIVE Act. 
   I hope you will join me and support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. One of the themes of the GIVE Act is to increase opportunities for veterans to serve in national service programs and to increase the amount of national service programs responding to the needs of veterans. 
   At committee, two amendments were adopted to address these issues. First, we directed the Corporation to reserve 3 percent of funds allotted to AmeriCorps for competitive grant programs that focus on veterans, particularly those that are recently returned from a deployment, and their families. The second amendment required the Corporation to conduct a study of how the national service laws would better serve veterans and increase veteran participation and service, and to create a pilot program based on that study. 
   This amendment builds up on those efforts. Under current law, States and corporations are charged with establishing priorities to determining the types of programs to be assisted under the national service law. This amendment would require States and the Corporation to include priorities for veterans when establishing priorities for the distribution of assistance under these programs. 
   Those priorities would be geared towards programs that recruit veterans into service opportunities, promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed, and promote community-based efforts to meet the unique service of military families when a member of the family returns from a deployment.     
   In addition, this amendment encourages the corporation to report to Congress on its efforts to increase the number of veterans serving in AmeriCorps and other positions that are eligible for the educational award. Veterans, particularly those recently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, deserve opportunities to reintegrate into their communities through service programs funded under the national service laws. This amendment will increase those opportunities. 
   At a time when our servicemen and -women are sacrificing on behalf of our country around the world, we should be doing all we can to repay that sacrifice. This amendment will make it the explicit policy of the Federal Government to encourage national service programs to focus more on the unique needs of these heroes and their families and to encourage more veterans to take advantage of service opportunities under these laws. 
   I certainly urge its passage, and I thank Mr. McKeon for offering this. It's a very good piece added to our legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Thank you. 
   We support this amendment, as it seeks to support the fostering of service among generations of a family. It is easy to imagine the kind of benefits that grandparents and their grandchildren would gain by not only spending time together, but serving others. The earlier children are introduced to service, the more likely they will volunteer throughout their life. 
   Speaking as a grandparent, and I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) for introducing this, when I take my grandchildren with me and I try to explain the work that I do, and to see them get involved and be interested in the work that I do I think is a great thing. 
   The volunteering work that we do, and we bring the grandchildren with us, it opens up their eyes for a number of reasons. A lot of the work that we do is serving in underserved areas and to be able to see that these young children, my grandchildren, 7 and 9, are out there in the community and seeing children less fortunate than them. But to take it back even then to their classroom and say maybe we can do something, when you have Grandparents Day in school with your grandchildren, and you're fostering the sense of volunteerism. 
   So I thank the gentleman very much for bringing this to our attention. I certainly am in full support of it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

Everyone gains when they speak to others from a different generation and learn how things have changed over the years. And yet, at the same time, how many things remain the same. 
   Fostering communication between people increases the connection for all of the community. This piece will add a section to the bill that is the sense of Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should make the maximum effort possible to coordinate with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in NACS programs to collect oral histories from senior citizens in the communities they serve. 
   With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to Mr. ANTHONY WEINER from New York.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I want to thank, again, my colleague Mr. English from Pennsylvania for this amendment. This would require the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service to coordinate with veterans organizations serving veterans to provide opportunities for young people to enroll in existing NACS programs to serve as drivers in the DAV transportation network on a full-time, part-time, or as-needed basis. The reason we support this amendment, which is similar to Mr. McKeon's in a way, is that it will help serve our Nation's veterans. This amendment reminds us of the challenges faced by disabled veterans after they have devoutly served our Nation. 
   When I see a lot of my veterans back home in Long Island, a lot of them do volunteer their time on driving our veterans back and forth. We only have one veterans hospital on Long Island. A lot of these drivers are as old as  those they are driving. So to see that our young people, and I can see something like this, which would be terrific for our young college students and our seniors that are driving, to be able to be part of this. 
   It was earlier mentioned by Mr. Shays that with the war in Iraq, no one has asked Americans to be helpful. Well, this is a perfect time. This is where our young people can feel that all right, here we have our veterans that have done a gallant job on protecting this Nation. Help them now. Let us help them to get back and forth for their physical therapy or any treatments that they need. 
   It's also a wonderful opportunity for our young people to get to know our seniors and our veterans that have served this country. The more I think about this, I am sorry that we didn't think of this amendment while we were having our committee hearings. I think next time I will reach out to my colleague and say what ideas do you have so we can bring them to the committee. 
   So, again, I support this amendment. I think it's a terrific amendment. I think it's a wonderful time for our young people and our seniors and our veterans to get to know each other. They will actually find they have a lot more in common than they do have apart. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague. Let me say that my colleague is having a problem with her voice with laryngitis, so I am actually going to be speaking for her from her talking points. So I will continue talking about Ohio, which has been particularly hurt by the current mortgage foreclosure crisis. 
   In a ranking of metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates, Ohio has the sad distinction of having four areas in the top 20. Northeast Ohio, which includes Lorain and Elyria in her district, had the sixth highest rate. Nearly 3 percent of all households in these cities are in some stage of foreclosure, a 112 percent jump from 2006. Akron came in at 12, Dayton at 15 and Toledo at 19. 
   The current subprime mortgage crisis has not stemmed from a single cause, and mitigating its effects will not be achieved with a single solution. Housing problems stem from predatory lending practices, job losses, and situations such as death, divorce and health emergencies. We must pursue innovative solutions, and this includes trying the provisions of volunteerism and Service-Learning grants to areas that have been adversely affected by the mortgage crisis. 
   This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to consider whether an area has a mortgage foreclosure rate greater than the national average when considering grant applications from States and other eligible entities. 
   Each year, more than 1.5 million individuals serve our country through the service programs that were created by the National and Community Service Act. In a time when so many of our communities are struggling, we need to pursue every avenue to make sure that the cities and towns with the greatest needs have access to the most assistance. 
   We expect this amendment is going to be noncontroversial, but they may argue that it is duplicative because of the factors that are already included. The areas affected by high foreclosure rates would likely also be areas with high concentrations of low-income persons and high unemployment rates. But when we look at this, we see that by including this additional factor we will focus the Corporation on awarding grant funding to programs that address the specific needs of communities affected by the foreclosure crisis. 
   When you look at this particular amendment, the Corporation for National and Community Service administers the National Service Trust Program, which provides funding for service programs, community groups, youth groups, service-lending, campus-based programs, pre-professional training programs and other services, one of the criteria the Corporation is required to consider when evaluating applications for funding is the extent to which projects would be conducted in the areas where they are needed most. 
   Factors already considered are communities designated as empowerment zones or redevelopment areas; targeted for special economic incentives; designated as having high concentrations  of low-income people; areas that are environmentally distressed; areas that are adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management of Federal lands that result in significant regional job losses and economic dislocation; areas adversely affected by reductions in defense spending or closure of bases; areas with unemployment rates greater than the national average for the 12 most recent months. 
   This amendment will add another factor that the Corporation must consider when determining what constitutes an area. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Ohio. 
   Good data collection is so important, because with data we can determine how to better implement programs and better serve the needs of our Nation's citizens. As workers must find ways to obtain new skills or transition into a new career, this study will provide us with important information. Service can be a bridge between one phase of life to another or from one career to another. 
   It is not a secret to anyone that Ms. Sutton's home State of Ohio has suffered tremendous job losses in recent years. From the year 2000 to 2007, Ohio has lost more than 209,000 non-farm jobs, the biggest 7 year drop since the end of the Great Depression. These workers and families deserve our support, and they deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives. 
   This study and pilot program require the Corporation for National and Community Service to examine how to use community service programs to provide opportunities for displaced workers. Programs such as AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have done so much to provide opportunities for our young and our seniors. It is time that we investigate ways to provide similar opportunities for Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 
   Workers who have toiled for so long in manufacturing plants have much to offer their communities, and their unique skill sets and leadership capabilities should not go to waste when plants close. I look forward to seeing how new service programs would reinvigorate America's displaced workforce with a sense of purpose so they may explore new career opportunities and continue contributing to all their communities. 
   The Corporation for National and Community Service has proven itself to be an entrepreneurial, innovative and effective organization. This amendment will lead the Corporation in a new direction to consider how the programs they provide funding to can do better serve the needs of America's displaced workers.  
   Our national service laws provide funding for numerous worthy organizations such as AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, Habitat for Humanity, City Year, Boys and Girls Club, Teach for America, and Youthbuild. This amendment will spur new programs that address the needs of our displaced workers and their families. 
   So, again I thank my colleague from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for offering this amendment, and I am looking forward to working with her on other areas.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. When the National Community Service Act was enacted in 1990, we saw powerful new opportunities to inspire civic engagement and transformation in our communities. Last year, AmeriCorps' number reached 500,000, and today Learn and Serve Americans continue to support service learning for K-12 and college students making a vital connection between their academic studies and a real world application through their service. 
   Now, with the Summer of Service program, we can provide a new opening to reach many young people we know will benefit with the opportunities to spend a summer in service to their communities. It is a right of passage during grades 5-12. 
   Mr. Chairman, this program grants educational awards of up to $500 to students who complete 100 hours of service over the summer months. By employing service-learning models to teach civic participation skills, the program will help young people serve their communities and expand educational opportunities for themselves and discourage what is commonly known as the summer academic slide. 
   Today, 10 million students nationwide between the ages of 12 and 18 have participated in school-based service. Research shows that, among those students, teens from disadvantaged communities who serve hold more positive civic attitudes. Kids who engage in volunteering are more likely to be successful in school and avoid risky behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, and crime. Unfortunately, those disadvantaged teens who have so much to gain from the experience are less likely to volunteer than their peers from more advanced backgrounds. 
   When service is tied to what students are learning in school, young people make gains on achievement tests, complete their homework more often, and increase their grade point average. Students who engage in service learning improve communication skills, grow more aware of career possibilities, and develop more positive workplace attitudes, laying the foundation for America's future leaders. Yet, Learn and Serve's funding stayed the same at no more than $43 million since 1996, and decreasing over the past several years. In Learn and Serve's last grant award cycle, they had 506 applications but only the resources for 102 awards. 
   For generations, during times of great crisis and need throughout our Nation, students have stepped up and served their country and their communities. Today, again, our young people want to serve and are desperate to do their part, yet their call has gone unheard. 
   Since 2001, there have been nearly 50 proposals involving national service before Congress, and not one has been enacted. Here we have a program that demonstrates our commitment to that great promise. A modest investment in Summer of Service is an important and long overdue step in providing service-learning opportunities for young people to start. 
   We must do everything we can to help every child reach his or her full potential. We cannot teach our children until we honestly help them become engaged in their communities and give them the power to actively participate in their education. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield time to my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).

   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I want to say thank you to my colleague for offering this amendment, and I certainly fully support it. But I want to also address Mr. Flake's concern and clarify: While OMB conducted a part assessment on Learn and Serve, the Summer of Service initiative, what we are proposing is a new initiative that I believe has not been parted. 
   So with that being said, I think that when we look at the whole bill, and especially for the Summer of Service part, we have an opportunity to help our people, our young people during the summertime. This, to me, can certainly cut down on what we are seeing in our communities across this country right now, on more violence in our communities. We have to look at what is the underlying cause. 
   With that being said, we are certainly doing the most we can for the little amount of money that we have, to make the biggest impact on these children's lives. So with that being said, I certainly hope that when we come down to it that we will be against Mr. Flake's amendment and let this bill go forward, and let's help the young people, let's help our veterans, let us help everybody in this particular amendment. It is a good bill. It has been overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the aisle, but this particular amendment, as far as I am concerned, would hurt too many of our young people.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Chairman, during debate on H.R. 2419, the Department of Agriculture Appropriations bill, the issue of school nutrition came before the House. As the Chairwoman of the Committee on Education and Labor's Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities, ensuring our Nation's youth have access to healthy school lunches and understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle is of vital importance to me. 
   As a nurse, I have seen first hand the importance of a balanced diet. Many health issues can be avoided by simply maintaining a balanced diet. Unfortunately, our Nation's youth do not always have healthy options. The high sugar snacks they see advertised on television provide no nutrition and are a major factor in weight gain. It is important that our Nation's youth have healthy options that taste good and are appealing to them. 
   Obesity is a major problem facing our Nation's youth. Childhood diabetes is also on the rise. Type II diabetes, which only used to be seen in older adults is now becoming prevalent in children. These issues clearly extend  beyond children to the whole family and the community in which they live. One way Congress can help reduce these numbers is by providing healthy school lunches. 
   Although meals provided in schools are required by law to follow nutrition standards in accordance with the ``Dietary Guidelines for Americans'', a child with the money available can just as easily avoid nutrition and grab a soda and a bag of chips down the hall in the vending machines. These items, although bad for one's health, often taste better to students and there are no guidelines for schools on healthy living and eating. 
   Another issue facing school nutrition is the reduced price meal program. This is a vital program that helps low-income families afford meals for their children. Unfortunately, for many families, the cost is found to be a challenge. It breaks my heart to read that families struggle to afford the 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch which is the charge for the reduced price meals. 
   Families cannot afford less than $1 a day to have two solid, nutritious meals provided to a child. This is a travesty, and I support study to see the effects of using the WIC income guidelines as the free meal guidelines, 
   As Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Healthy Families and Communities, I understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and as a parent I know that we must teach our children the value of nutritious food and healthy living. We cannot ignore the factors outside the classroom that contribute to the education of our youth. They are the future of our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (WALTER REED -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the conditions that we have been hearing about on the care of our veterans at Walter Reed Outpatient Care. 
   Walter Reed is the first stop for many of our brave men and women returning from Iraq. These soldiers risked their lives defending this great Nation. They have lost friends in combat, and they have seen countless comrades lose limbs and suffer horrible wounds. They expect no reward in return for their bravery. 
   Unfortunately, the treatment they have received when entering the outpatient care is substandard. Conditions at Walter Reed Building 18, even though they are being improved today, should have never gotten to that condition. 
   We have all read reports on the matter; so I will not go into all of the details. 
   Mr. Speaker, if these conditions existed in the public, the authorities would have quickly been notified. However, the mismanagement of care does not end with Building 18. Many of our veterans are lost in the system once they are transferred to the outpatient care. Case files are being lost. Head trauma victims are not receiving the level of managed care they require. Non-English-speaking families are left to navigate through the red tape that exists at Walter Reed and, I am sure, many other veterans' hospitals. 
   The management at Walter Reed is directly responsible for these conditions, and I know those are changing now. But, again, we must make sure this does not happen again. 
   Congress has the ability to improve the situation for our new veterans. We are all aware of the benefits of health information technology. Health IT allows patients to move throughout the health care system in an easy manner. If Health IT was implemented at Walter Reed, our veterans would be able to move from inpatient to outpatient care without the fear that their records would be lost. The benefits our veterans would receive if health IT is implemented far outreach the cost of the system. 
   Many of our Iraqi veterans are coming home with head injuries. Roadside bombs and IEDs are responsible for this increase. These veterans require constant care and supervision. Many of them have lost cognitive abilities. In some of the worst cases, veterans are barely aware of their surroundings. 
   Let me say this: I know a lot about head injuries. Going back 13 years ago, my son was shot in the head, received traumatic head injuries, and he was left partially paralyzed. We were lucky. His mom was a nurse. She knew how to go through the system. He was also lucky that I had training in physical therapy. People understand, he was only 26 at that time, as many of our soldiers that are injured. They don't need just 3 hours of physical therapy a day; they need 4 in the morning, 4 in the afternoon, and then they need their families around them to take care of them in the evening time. It is hard. It is difficult work. But I know our young men and women are able to do this. The families need to be trained on how to work with their children that have head trauma. 
   But, again, it is up to us here in Congress, and I know there are hearings, but we must come up with answers on giving the treatment to these veterans with head injuries and to all our veterans that go through Walter Reed. 
   You cannot expect someone to go onto the campus and think that they are going to remember that they have an appointment the next day. You can't expect them to understand even sometimes where they are at that particular moment. 
   This has been treatment that we know how to give, and why we haven't given it to them I do not understand. 
   I know that Walter Reed is one of the best hospitals in the Nation, as long as you are in the hospital. But when you come out, that is where we are losing our veterans through the cracks. It is unacceptable, and we in Congress have a responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen. 
   During the Vietnam War, our military came home, and, unfortunately, we did not honor them the way they should have been honored. I thought we had learned our lesson. 
   The brave young men and women representing this country have done a wonderful job, and for us to even let down any kind of health care treatment for them is a black mark on this Congress and certainly on us, the United States of America. 
   I know the President has put a commission in place. I have been around here long enough to know, enough commissions. We need action. We can do it. That is what we are very good at, getting down to the bottom of it and putting in action. We can't have these veterans wait any longer. 
   Let me say this: Every day, Members of Congress get on the floor and say what a wonderful job our men and women are doing. Every day we honor them. And yet all of us have let them down. That is not acceptable. I hope that we will do better in the future. The future has to be now. The time has to be now. We cannot wait 2 to 3 to 4 months for a commission report.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (LIHEAP -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, last winter our Nation experienced record high heating bills, and this summer's cooling bills are expected to follow suit. LIHEAP is authorized at $5.1 billion, and the program has never been fully funded. Concerns are high across the Nation that LIHEAP will not be able to help those people that need the most help because it is set to run out of money before the most intense periods of the heating and cooling seasons start. 
   Congress and the President can act by fully funding LIHEAP through authorizing the spending of $3.12 billion in the second economic stimulus package. With this action, Congress and the President would send a clear message to the Nation: We do care about those that are most vulnerable. LIHEAP works not only to protect our Nation's vulnerable, low-income populations but also to stimulate the economy so that those families can spend money more fully for other things. 
   Fully funding LIHEAP should be a top priority for this Congress, and we should fully fund the program in the second stimulus package. We have an opportunity to help those that are having a hard time to get by during these times.

<DOCNO>Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. (MEDICAL IMAGING SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and ask my colleagues to support legislation reversing the dangerous cuts made to medical imaging services by the last Congress. 
   The incorporation of imaging technology into medical practice has transformed physician practice, patient care, and improved health outcomes for millions of Americans. 
   Unfortunately, the Deficit Reduction Act last Congress slashed funding for imaging services. These dangerous cuts mean that women will have difficulty getting a mammogram. Doctors will begin to phase out imaging services because the reimbursement rate will cause them to lose money. 
   While these cuts may have saved the government money, it has increased the health risks of our Nation's citizens. Patients throughout the United States depend on medical imaging because it often detects critical illnesses at their most curable stage when they are less costly to treat. Better, less invasive care often means easier recoveries and greater patient comfort are additional reasons why drastic cuts to medical imaging do not serve the patient well. 
   Medical imaging is an overall cost-saver for patients and the health care system in general because it results in fewer complications, earlier detection, shorter hospital stays, and better pain management. 
   Our goal should be keeping our workers healthy and on the job by helping them avoid surgery, long recuperation and disability. For this reason, significant cuts to medical imaging are not the solution. That is why I ask your support and need it for H.R. 1293, Access to Medical Care Imaging Act of 2007. My legislation would suspend for 2 years drastic cuts to critical diagnostic imaging services provided in physicians' offices and imaging centers. 
   The cuts were agreed to with little public debate by the U.S. House of Representatives, yet they account for more than one-third of the Medicare cuts in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Furthermore, as was directly pointed out by Members on both sides of the aisle during the Energy and Health Subcommittee hearing on July 18 last year, the policy was not recommended to Congress by MedPAC or CMS, and there has been no analysis of the impact of the cuts on seniors' access to imaging services. 
   Unfortunately, despite broad bipartisan support in Congress to delay the DRA policy, the DRA imaging cuts went into effect in January of this year. My legislation would place a 2-year hold on the implementation of the cuts and require a comprehensive GAO study on patient access and service issues relating to the availability and quality of imaging services in physician offices and imaging clinics with special attention to seniors living in rural and medically underserved areas. 
   Please join over 150 of my colleagues and become a cosponsor of H.R. 1293. People have to understand sometimes the cuts that we make around here are not in the best interest certainly of our constituents. Spending most of my life as a nurse, preventive care is better than letting it go. That is why our health care costs are so high. We need to do a better job of making sure that our constituents are served.
