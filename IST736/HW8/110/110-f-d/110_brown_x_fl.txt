<TEXT>
   Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank the 415 ``yes'' votes for the Florida Gators, and we will continue to work on the four present, teaching them good sportsmanship. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my University of Florida basketball team for winning back-to-back NCAA basketball championships. The Gators basketball team is the first to successfully defend their basketball championship since 1992. Go Gators. 
   The Florida Gators teams that won those championships exhibit teamwork and sportsmanship rarely seen in college sports. This is the first time in the history that the exact same starting five was able to repeat the championship. No one left to be stars in the NBA. They came back to prove to the world that the University of Florida's win was no fluke, and the Florida Gators are a championship team that have made history. 
   Let's talk history. The Gators' win was the first time in college sports history that identical match ups and the results were the same. Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47, and Florida's Corey Brewer was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach at the age of 41 to win two titles. The Gators finished with a 10-game winning streak and haven't lost a post-season game in 18 tries, including sweeping the Southeastern Conference tournaments the last 2 years. 
   Coach Billy Donovan should deserves credit for building the team from scratch and teaching the players how to win and how to act like champions. This success at Florida opens other opportunities, but he has chosen to remain a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan is truly a great coach and a great leader. To close, I would just like to say, it's great to be a Florida gator.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 635, a resolution recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal. This resolution also commends the Muslims in the United States and across the globe for their devotion. 
   Ramadan demonstrates the strength of each Muslim's faith with a month of prayers, fasting, charity and self reflection. It is a beautiful observance each year by those who believe in Islam. 
   It is important to have resolutions like this that recognizes and shows respect for one of the world's most significant religions, Islam, and the nearly 1.5 billion Muslims throughout the world. Following the September 11th attacks, I am sad to say, there was an outbreak of bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans, American Muslims and Americans from South Asia. Intolerance is not an American value and Congress must show its support for the community of Islam in the United States and throughout the world. 
   I would like to thank Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, Congressman GREGORY MEEKS and Congressman KEITH ELLISON for introducing the resolution and working to bring it to the House floor today.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on this bill and on all transportation issues. 
   Mr. Oberstar is really a transportation guru. And to listen to Mr. Mica here today arguing for high speed rail--no, not arguing--debating, supporting, oh, we've come a long way in this country as far as the reauthorization of Amtrak. And this is an exciting day for the American people. 
   With gas prices rapidly rising to $5 a gallon, we could not be moving in conference on a more important bill than Amtrak reauthorization. I'm excited for the American people and the prospect of having more transportation options than getting in your cars and driving. 
   This weekend, I sent my mom to our family reunion, to Lakeland, Florida on Amtrak. Her trip was a perfect example of why we need to expand services, add, boost, and provide additional passenger and vehicle cars. The train she was riding on was so busy that people were actually sleeping on the floors of the train. 
   Amtrak's improvements on its physical state and recent focus on customer service, along with increasing highway and airport congestion and rising gas prices, have made interest in passenger rail more popular and necessary than ever. More than just a convenient way to travel, Amtrak is also energy efficient. Rail travel is more energy efficient and uses less fuel than cars or airplanes. According to the U.S. Department of Energy data, Amtrak is 17 percent more efficient than domestic airline travel and 21 percent more efficient than automobile travel. 
   Passenger rail also reduces global warming. The average passenger rail train produces 60 percent lower carbon emissions than cars and 50 percent less than airplanes. 
   In the fiscal year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight year of record ridership. Like its ridership gains, Amtrak's fiscal performance has improved as well, posting $1.5 billion in ticket revenue. A gain of 10 percent. 
   On May 10, Amtrak celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout the country showcasing interests in the passenger rail and its importance to the Nation. I celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout my district, including press conferences and events in Jacksonville, Winter Park, and at the Sanford Auto Train station. Every event had a great turnout showing strong support for Amtrak, and I got to hear firsthand accounts of people who use Amtrak every day to go to work, visit friends and families all over the country.  
   Congress also showed strong support for Amtrak and passenger rail by passing legislation supporting Amtrak Train Day by a vote of 415-0. 
   Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower created the National Highway System which changed the way we travel in this country. Today, we need to do the same thing with passenger rail and make the level of investment necessary for it to become even more successful in the future. 
   I was in New Orleans this weekend with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and at a press conference the Speaker stated the importance of investing in rail infrastructure. She stated that it is not only important to offer alternatives to highway travel, but is critical for transporting citizens out of harm's way during national disasters. 
   The United States used to be the best passenger rail service in the world. Now we are the caboose, and they don't even use cabooses any more. The American people deserve better. I believe this Amtrak Reauthorization will go a long way to restore the U.S. to its rightful place as a world leader in passenger rail. Going to conference with the Senate is the next major step in bringing our Nation's intercity passenger rail into the 21st century. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this suspension bill which will allow the House and Senate to go to conference on Amtrak.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I've got to say that one of the joys of serving in this Congress is serving on this Transportation and Infrastructure Committee with Mr. Oberstar, who is the guru of transportation, not just for Amtrak, but every single area of transportation. And for helping to develop this Amtrak bill. Eleven years without a bill. The last authorization was 11 years ago. 
   And of course I want to thank Mr. Mica for his leadership in this area, and Mr. Shuster, and also Mr. LaTourette, because I want people to know that we didn't just come up with this bill today. This is a bill we've been working on for years. And this is an exciting day for the American people, a real milestone. 
   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act provides over $2 billion per year for capital and operational grants, $500 million per year for developing State passenger corridors, $345 million per year to pay down debt, $345 million per year for high-speed rail programs, and requires a plan for restoring service to the Sunset Limited Line. 
   Amtrak's improved physical state and recent focus on customers service, along with increased highways and airport congestion and rising gas prices, have made intercity passenger rail more popular and necessary than ever. 
   In Fiscal Year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight fiscal year of record ridership. Like its ridership gains, Amtrak's financial performance has improved as well, posting approximately $1.5 billion in ticket revenue, a gain of 10.8 percent over 2006 ticket revenue, and the third consecutive year that ticket revenues increased. 
   More than just a convenient way to travel, Amtrak is also energy efficient. Rail travel is more energy efficient and uses less fuel than cars or airplanes. According to the U.S. Department of Energy data, Amtrak is 17 percent more efficient than domestic airline travel and 21 percent more efficient than automobile travel. 
   And let me just say that there is no mode of transportation that pays for itself. We all subsidize every form of transportation. 
   Current initiatives include a more sleek model, more efficient Auto Train fleet, reducing annual fuel usage by 640,000 gallons, and remanufacturing brake systems throughout the Amtrak fleet that will reduce energy consumption by 8 percent. 
   Passenger rail also reduces global warming. The average passenger rail train produces 60 percent lower carbon emissions than cars and 50 percent less than airplanes. 
   On May 10, Amtrak celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout the country, over 60, to be exact, showcasing intercity passenger rail and its importance to this Nation. I celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout my district, including press conferences and events in Jacksonville, Winter Park and at the Sanford Auto Train station. Every event had great turnout, showing strong support for Amtrak, and I got to hear firsthand accounts of people who use Amtrak every day to go to work, to visit friends and family all over the country. 
   Congress also showed strong support for Amtrak and passenger rail by passing legislation supporting National Train Day by 415-0. 
   Fifty years ago President Eisenhower created the national highway system, which really changed the way we travel in this country. Today we need to do the same thing with passenger rail, and make the level of investment necessary for it to become more successful in the future. 
   The American people deserve the best passenger rail in the world, and I believe that this Amtrak authorization will go a long way to raise the U.S. to its rightful place as a world leader in passenger rail. 
   Passing of H.R. 6003 will be the first major step in bringing our Nation's intercity passenger rail system to the 21st century. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, once again I want to thank Mr. Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairman Shuster and the staff. On behalf of the American people, I thank you. This is really a great day. 
   Let me say thank you, Mr. Oberstar, for your hard work on this bill and helping to develop this manager's amendment which incorporates provisions in the bill that would improve the overall Amtrak system. We are falling behind other industrialized nations who have prepared their country for the future by investing heavily in high-speed rail. 
   Mr. Oberstar talked about what he did when he was right out of college with his scholarship and how it took him 6 hours to go from downtown Brussels to downtown Paris. Now it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes, over 200 miles. We went less than 6 months ago to visit a new system, downtown Barcelona, Spain, to downtown Madrid, over 300 miles, 2 1/2 hours, and we didn't even know we were moving. 
   That is our competition. That is who we are competing against as far as when we talk about trade and other issues. They are able to move their people, goods and services, and we are falling behind. 
   Amtrak reauthorization legislation is one of the few pieces of transportation legislation that has passed the Senate. Let me repeat that. Amtrak reauthorization legislation is one of the only pieces of legislation that has passed the other body. We have a great opportunity to go to conference and send a bill to the President's desk that provides a tremendous benefit for the traveling public, creating economic development and decreased energy consumption.  
   The American people deserve the best passenger rail system in the world. I have said over and over and over again, we are the caboose, and we don't use cabooses anymore. 
   This legislation takes a proactive step in addressing the outrageous cost of gas, now over $4 a gallon, and it makes a statement that we are serious about improving our dependence on foreign oil. Rail travel is more efficient and uses less fuel than both cars and airplanes. 
   I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment and support the bill so we can quickly move this bill through the process and have it on the President's desk for his signature.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, the Washington D.C. Metro system is the fourth busiest transit system in the nation. The system provides transportation to the federal employees who work here everyday and the millions of visitors that visit the city each year. 
   This amendment will require a dedicated funding source provided by the local governments that are served by the Metro. Something for which the Metro has been without for far too long. 
   It also creates an office of Inspector General to help provide oversight of the system. 
   This legislation also ensures that rail customers will have access to a broad range of wireless providers in case of an emergency and will provide additional dollars to the Transit Authority. 
   The Metro system that serves this country's capital is a national asset and I hope that both the local and federal government will continue to show full support for the system.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, we would encourage Amtrak to work closely with all the states they operate in to ensure that they are operating in conjunction with local commuter systems. 
   This is one more example of the need for additional rail capacity and the affect this lack of additional infrastructure can have on a state. 
   As more and more states turn to commuter rail service to move their citizens, it will be imperative that passenger, commuter, and freight rail work together to best utilize limited rail resources.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. I encourage my colleagues to reject this sham amendment. Prohibiting funds for one route will have negative effects on the entire system, and it's already addressed in this legislation in a way that won't harm Amtrak and the services it provides. 
   Opponents of passenger rail have repeatedly tried to siphon off the growth of our Nation's rail system by cutting funds, zeroing out the budget, and now cutting out the only transcontinental passenger route; all while in the same time the opponents have the gall to ask for a better profit model. 
   Let me tell you, I've got some breaking news for you. There is something  more important than profit. Amtrak was the first responder during Hurricane Katrina and used the Sunset Limited line, which is being restored in this legislation, to help evacuate thousands of gulf coast region residents while President Bush and his administration was nowhere to be found. Now, that is a part of every key State future evacuation plan. 
   This amendment will have a negative effect on major States, eight--California, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas, Texas, Texas. 
   The Sessions amendment will do the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish with this legislation, which is to expand passenger rail service, reduce congestion and improve our energy independence. 
   Passenger rail's ability to reduce congestion is well known, with ridership numbers increasing steadily each year. One full passenger train can take 250 to 350 cars off the road. Passenger rail also consumes less energy than both automobiles and commercial airlines. 
   I would encourage any Member who don't want to explain to their constituents why they no longer have access to Amtrak service, to vote ``no'' on this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, anyone who has railroad tracks in their district has heard from constituents who are upset by repeated train whistles. 
   Unfortunately, these train whistles are the most effective way of warning people of an oncoming train. And even still we see constant reports of injuries and deaths on the tracks. 
   Technology holds the key to many improvements throughout our rail system, including improved safety. And hopefully it can help with the age-old problem of train whistles. 
   We also need to invest in more grade separations at rail crossings to improve safety and  cut down on the need to blow warning whistles in the first place.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I stand before you today in support of H. Res. 272, drafted by my colleague Representative BARBARA LEE from California. I would like to thank her for her leadership on this issue in recognition of this important part of our shared history. 
   This year marks the 200th anniversary of the end of the transatlantic slave trade. In 1807 the United Kingdom outlawed slavery recognizing that the African slave trade and all manner of dealing and trading in the purchase, sale, barter, or transfer of slaves from any part of the coast or countries of Africa was unlawful and thereby abolished. 
   The transatlantic slave trade conducted the capture of Africans, mostly from West Africa, for the purpose of enslavement in the colonies that would become the United States, during the 15th and late 19th centuries. 
   The Middle Passage was the forced migration through overseas transport of millions of Africans to the Americas, many of whom suffered abuses of rape and perished as a result of torture, malnutrition, disease and resistance in transit. Those who survived this perilous journey were sold into slavery. 
   More than 12,000,000 Africans were transported in bondage from their African homelands to the Americas, and an estimated 1,200,000 men, women, and children born in the Americas were displaced in the forced migration that was the domestic slave trade. 
   It is important to acknowledge that as a result of the slave trade approximately 80,000,000 to 150,000,000 persons of African descent live in Latin America and the Caribbean, making them the largest population of persons of African descent outside of Africa. 
   The transatlantic slave trade is characterized as the largest forced migration in world history. 
   The institution of slavery which enslaved Africans, their progeny and later generations for life was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through 1865. 
   Slavery in the United States during and after British colonial rule included the sale and acquisition of Africans as chattel property in interstate and intrastate commerce. However their presence in southern states posed a problem for representation when the Union solidified. The Great Compromise of 1787 declared that the enslaved Africans would be counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of representation in the House of Representatives as not to give undue representation to southern states. 
   The slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane dispossession of Africans' life, liberty, and citizenship rights and denied them the fruits of their own labor. The enslaved Africans in the colonies and the United States suffered psychological and physical abuse, destruction of their culture, language, religion, and families. 
   I am disappointed that this body has been slow to act on the resolution denouncing slavery and offering an official apology to the descendants of slaves and the African American community. The 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, declared the slave trade and slavery a crime against humanity. The world recognizes the magnitude of this atrocity so why can't we make this simple step towards reconciliation? 
   The slave trade and the legacy of slavery continue to have a profound impact on social and economic disparity, hatred, bias, racism and discrimination in the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this and other legislation that serves to educate and increase awareness of the history of the slave trade and its impact on American culture.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I want to thank Mr. Barney Frank, chairman of the committee, and Maxine Waters and other members of the Committee on Financial Services for doing such a fine job in crafting this bill. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act. I truly believe this bill is a tremendous victory for the gulf coast that was affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I once again want to commend my colleagues. 
   Before I start talking about my amendment, let me talk about what happened during the hurricane because I saw something during Hurricane Katrina that I have never seen in the 25 years I have been an elected official and certainly the 15 years I have been a Member of Congress. I saw something in the government that I have never seen before. I saw a government that was not just incompetent, but I saw a government that did not care about its people. I thought I was in a third world, and I have got to take a moment to commend my community because we all watched it on television and were horrified. We came together. 
   I represent the Jacksonville area, and we came together as a community and we sent over 16 tractor-trailers full of goods and services to New Orleans. We came together as a community. It was the business community. It was Democrats; it was Republicans. It was students, and we filled those tractor-trailers and sent them in there until the government could kick in. 
   What we saw was a government that was not capable of responding. Well, when you look at the top 20 positions, and one police officer told me that you don't put people in positions over disasters that have public relations backgrounds. You make them ambassadors. But you put people in to head up disasters that are life and death to your communities that have the background and experience to do the job. That certainly was not the position of FEMA or Homeland Security. I want to put that on the table before I begin. 
   Now, this particular amendment would allow that residents returning would have the opportunity to include their utility bill into the payment for their rent. This is something that was taking place prior to, and this would be something that would be permitted under my amendment. 
   Many public housing residents are being forced into deeper debt because of utility bills. Public housing residents that lived in the areas of Rita and Katrina had their monthly rent included in their utilities. Currently, their vouchers do not include utilities, and many public housing residents are forced to make tough choices. 
   I have three such examples. Bobby Jennings lived in C.J. Peete for 34 years prior to Katrina. She paid income-based rent in the amount of $167 per month, which included utilities. Now she lives in another part and she pays $1,050 in rent which is not covered by her rent voucher, and she must pay $429 per month out of pocket. Well, her average income, she is a senior citizen on a fixed income, is $655 per month. So $300 per month she has to come up with. 
   And that is the same for Mrs. Gloria Williams who was paying $185 per month. Now she pays $1,128 per month and she must come up with $406 per month.     
   The last person is Mrs. Wright. She lived in public housing for over 20 years. She was paying the amount of $290 per month. She is in Houston, Texas. She now pays $625 a month, and she has to come up with an average of $250 a month for utilities. So utilities impose a disproportionate burden for the poor. And for the average American, utility bills only comprise 6 to 10 percent of household income. In this area it is 32 to 53 percent. Those receiving vouchers have already demonstrated their great need for assistance, and they are being shortchanged. We can't allow this to continue, and we must provide proper funding to those receiving this voucher. 
   This amendment would ensure that utilities are part of the housing voucher for residents returning to New Orleans. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would have no direct impact as far as spending is concerned. 
   I urge the adoption of this amendment to help people like Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Wright receive the assistance they greatly deserve. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from California.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Let me clarify my statement. 
   First of all, let me say that during the time of the hurricane, what I saw was a government that didn't care. It wasn't working. Everybody in the whole country, in fact, in the whole world saw that. It was a real serious indictment on the Bush administration that was in charge. 
   But I said since that time people have blamed the local government, the State government and the Federal Government. Yes, we have done our part, but perhaps we could have done a better job in spelling out how that money is to be used, because regardless of how much money we have appropriated, and we have appropriated and we have done a good job with that, the money has not gotten down to the people that we intended for it to get to.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Before I decide whether to withdraw my amendment, I have some questions for Ms. Waters about the present status of the deadlines that are in the bill, and maybe she can clarify it for me. I have a concern that we have certain dates and deadlines in this bill. And, of course, this bill, when it passes the House, has to go to the Senate, and we have certain deadlines in that bill, and then the President has to sign it. I am concerned that when it is signed, that the residents won't have an adequate amount of time to respond. 
   As you well know, in the hearing that took place 18 months ago, HUD and Public Housing said of the residents that they had surveyed that they had only contacted about 25 percent. And so I want to make sure that those people are not disadvantaged and we are all on the same page. We all care about the same people. 
   Can you clarify for me the status of that situation?

In addition, my understanding is that, for example, if that person didn't have insurance, and even though the insurance told them that they were not in the area, and they have that in writing, they weren't in the flood area, they were penalized 30 percent. So that is $30,000. So then a person could end up with $20,000 for their home, and they cannot rebuild with that.

   I rise in support of H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act. I truly believe this bill is a tremendous victory for the Gulf Coast and those affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I commend my colleague Congressman Barney Frank, Congresswoman Maxine Waters and the other Members of the Committee on Financial Services for the fine job crafting this bill. 
   I also rise in support of my amendment that would give Katrina public housing residents more time to return home. 
   Eighteen months after Hurricane Katrina, more than 4,000 families have not returned to New Orleans because most public housing remains closed. Public housing residents want to return and rebuild their city and their lives. If Congress is serious about the slogan ``Bring New Orleans Back,'' HUD and HANO must re-open public housing and make repairs, where necessary. Everyone should be permitted to return--not just the rich. 
   HUD and HANO have been doing everything they can to make sure public housing residents don't return. HUD planned to demolish 5,000 units with no clear plan or timeline for bringing back these families. These public housing developments are some of the most durable housing in New Orleans. Given the solid infrastructure of these buildings and the minor damage incurred, it is clear that renovation is more cost-effective than demolition. Instead of families moving back 
   into their affordable housing units to get back to work, and help rebuild their lives, their communities, and their city, HUD contributes to the dearth of affordable housing in New Orleans, and keeps these families displaced and scattered across the country with no hope of returning. 
   HUD has dropped the ball on keeping contact with displaced families. At a February 22, 2007 field hearing in New Orleans for the House Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, Chairman C. Donald Babers of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) told the subcommittee that out of 978 residents they recently tried to contact, they only made contact with about 237 residents. Mr. Babers said that they were unable to reach about 740 residents. Given that HUD and HANO only one month ago could not reach over 75 percent of the displaced public housing residents, Congress must ensure that residents do not lose the opportunity to move back to their homes simply because HANO and HUD cannot find them in a timely manner. 
   Residents want to come home to be closer to their families and neighbors, to return to jobs or get new jobs in the reconstruction industry. HUD reported in October 2006 that an estimated 65-70 percent of families want to return to New Orleans. Congress must give these families every chance to come home. 
   My amendment provides two deadlines of August 1, 2007 and October 1, 2007 for residents to declare their intent to return. The reoccupancy deadlines are October 1, 2007 and December 1, 2007. It also extends assistance to those who ask for help with early termination of leases. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment so that we can Bring New Orleans Back.  
   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember a spiritual warrior for her constituents and those who could not fight for themselves, JULIA CARSON. She served 6 years in Congress, but her experience here far outweighed her time here. She always remembered where she was from and how she got there. 
   This was a tough lady. She spent her initial swearing in in the hospital recovering from double bypass surgery. She was a wonderful personal friend who I enjoyed spending time with. 
   I have my JULIA CARSON story. I remember a few years ago, we were going to an event at the Army-Navy Golf Club. We were going to a program, a celebration, and our driver got lost and made a wrong turn. We ended up on the seventh fairway. We were going up the hill, and the car couldn't go up and it couldn't go back. I panicked, but she was calm during this entire process. We eventually were rescued by the Capitol Hill Police. I will never forget that experience.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply reprograms funds for a project that was included in the 2002 VA-HUD appropriation bill to another project in the same city. 
   The city of Maitland, Florida, which is located in the southern portion of my district, had money allocated to them for the construction of a community center. Unfortunately, the project was completed before funds were distributed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and they are now unable to use this money. 
   The city of Maitland, the recipient of the funds, has requested that the funds be redirected to another EDI project that involves the redevelopment of a public park that includes the creation of age-specific exercise courses and walking and bike paths. 
   The money promised to Maitland is still available at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and will have no financial impact on this year's bill. The community center is fully completed, making funds earmarked for this project useless to the city. 
   Every Member knows this type of Federal funding is crucial to a small city like Maitland, and I would hate to see funds meant for my district go unspent because we could not, HUD, get their act together and make this change. 
   I would ask the chairman to work with me as this bill moves forward to try to help the city of Maitland solve this problem. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm going to withdraw this amendment, but I'm hoping that as we move forward, you will work to help rectify this problem that was created by the Department of HUD and this administration. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, here we go again, trying to destroy passenger rail in this country. The United States used to be the best passenger rail system in the world. Now we're the caboose, and we don't even use cabooses anymore. 
   For far too long this Congress has given Amtrak just enough money to limp along, never giving them the funds they needed to make serious improvements in the system. 
   Amtrak was a first responder during Hurricane Katrina and used the Sunset Limited line to help evacuate thousands of gulf region residents while President Bush and his administration was nowhere to be found. Now they are becoming a key part of each State's future evacuation plan. 
   Every industrialized country in the world is investing heavily in rail infrastructure because they realize that this is the future of transportation. But, sadly, as their systems get bigger and better, our system gets less and less money. 
   Vote ``no'' on the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, and Chairman Edwards for bringing this bill to the floor. The motto of the former Veterans Secretary, my friend Jessie Brown, was ``putting veterans first.'' 
   Well, the leadership they have shown, bringing the largest increase in the history of veterans funding to the floor, over $7 billion, I have got to thank you, sir. I have served on this committee for 15 years, and for 15 years we have struggled to put the veterans first. And I am so pleased that the House of Representatives under your leadership has finally put the veterans first. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise on my amendment to bring attention to a travesty occurring in my district. A travesty not just affecting my district, but this regional hospital affects Florida and Georgia. 
   The Gainesville VA Medical Center is 40 years old and looks every day of it. There are five beds to a room, no shower, and no place for families. 
   This facility received one of the highest rates of returning Afghanistan and Iraq veterans and is being shortchanged by a lack of proper facilities. The bed tower project includes 228 single-patient bedrooms for surgical, medical, and psychiatric patients. This includes extra space for support of the psychiatric care inpatient program. Finally, the building itself was required to be structurally strengthened to protect it from potential terrorist attack since we are part of the national emergency response system. The current design will be completed in June 2007 and will be ready to be released for bid in September 2007. 
   Since the approval by the National CARES Commission and initial funding allocation, much has changed in the construction world. The dual impacts of Hurricane Katrina and the construction boom in China have caused the costs of all construction in the U.S. to rise. 
   The total estimated construction cost is over $103 million. The original projection was $64 million for construction. That leaves a shortfall of about $40 million. 
   Every month of delay costs about $1.1 million. An additional $40 million is needed in order to complete the project. 
   The men and women returning to Florida and southern Georgia will be greatly impacted, and I would like to work with the committee to resolve this matter. 
   Mr. Chairman, do I have the word of the chairman to look into this matter?

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. First of all, let me thank Chairman Filner for shepherding the bills that we have here on the floor, for bringing these bills to the floor on this date. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been on Veterans' Affairs for 15 years, and as we approach Memorial Day, we do it to honor our veterans. The entire time I have been proud to be on this committee, because it is what we do for our veterans. 
   One of the things, Mr. Buyer, that I have enjoyed about serving on this committee is that it has always been bipartisan. We have always worked together for the veterans in this country, and we need to continue to do that. 
   As we move into this Memorial Day, and I think about what I have to do next Monday, when I go home, to face those families, we need to be honoring them today here on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   If we have any personal matters, it needs to be taken up at that particular time and not here on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   Earlier today I had the privilege of joining the Congressional Women's Caucus at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington  National Cemetery. Earlier today we honored four members of the United States Armed Forces, and it was my privilege to be there. The late Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, a key member in the Women's Caucus, was instrumental in organizing this year's celebration. 
   It wasn't until 1971 that the last Monday in May became the official national holiday, as we know today, as Memorial Day. The day itself was born from the tragedy of the Civil War when soldiers and family members in the North and the South decorated the graves of fallen soldiers with flowers. 
   In 1868, seeking to formalize this touching tribute, General John Logan, Commander in Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order Number 11 designating May 30, 1868, as Decoration Day, for the purpose of laying flowers and decorating graves of those who died in the defense of their country, our great country. 
   All together, these bills move benefits for veterans into the 21st century. From extending the eligible period for health care for combat service in the Persian Gulf to treating of trauma, brain injury, vocational rehabilitation benefits, chiropractic benefits and outreach activities at the VA, finally to deal with the final resting place for those who have sacrificed for the freedom of this Nation, these bills and this House honor our Nation's veterans. 
   I support all of these bills, and I urge my colleagues to support them as well. Let us all honor the veterans who have done so much for us and these families as we go into Memorial Day. 
   God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvements Act. 
   This program, begun under President Clinton, has invested over $12 billion to add officers to the Nation's streets and schools, enhance crime-fighting technology, support crime prevention initiatives, provide training and technical assistance, administer grant programs, and advance community policing. Since President Bush has taken office, he has done everything he could to cut or eliminate funding for this worthwhile program. 
   In the Third District of Florida alone, over $89,420,196 in COPS grants were awarded to law enforcement agencies: COPS grants have funded 1,192 additional police officers and sheriffs deputies to engage in community policing activities, including crime prevention, in the 3rd District; 24 local and State law enforcement agencies in the 3rd District have directly benefited from funding made available through the COPS Office; $6,187,466 has been awarded to add 52 school resources officers to improve safety for students, teachers, and administrators in primary and secondary schools throughout the 3rd District; and $10,780,628 has been awarded for crime-fighting technologies. This funding has allowed officers to spend more time on the streets of the 3rd District of Florida fighting and preventing crime through timesaving technology, information-sharing systems, and improved communications equipment. 
   My district is not alone. The COPS program has helped districts across the Nation by reducing crime and making communities safer for residents to live their lives. 
   Earlier this session, I introduced a resolution urging increased funding for both the COPS program and the Weed and Seed program, which is an innovative, comprehensive, multiagency approach to law enforcement, crime prevention, and community revitalization. Both these programs go together--community policing and community revitalization. 
   I am submitting for the record a letter from the city of Orlando in support of this bill. 
   I urge support for the COPS program, safer communities and this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget offered today. The CBC budget will change a 6 year Republican policy that I call Reverse Robin Hood, stealing from the poor to give to the rich. 
   You might ask why the Democratic Budget, which I support, needs improvement. The Democratic Budget needs improvement because when America has a cold, African-Americans have pneumonia. The CBC budget reverses the deep cuts that have been made in the programs that serve the neediest Americans. 
   Over a 5 year period, compared to the President's budget the CBC spends: $158 billion more on education, training, employment and social services; $101 billion more on healthcare; $19 billion more on community and regional development; $42 billion more on veterans benefits and services; $12 billion more on administration of justice; $21 billion more on homeland security; and $5.8 billion more on international affairs. 
   Even after funding these priorities, the CBC alternative budget still manages to balance the budget in Fiscal Year 2012 and in fact, creates a surplus of $141 billion. 
   As an African American woman who represents one of the poorest districts in the state of Florida, I am proud to say that the Congressional Black Caucus's Budget demonstrates that fiscal responsibility and spending on programs that are important to the African-American people are not mutually exclusive. I encourage all my colleagues to support the CBC Budget.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Democratic budget offered today. This budget is a stark contrast to the President's budget which proves to be entirely insufficient in meeting the needs of our Nation, and those of my constituents in the third district of Florida. A budget is about priorities, and the President's priorities are to ask our seniors, our students, our children, the middle class, and the working poor, to make fiscal sacrifices, while the rich count their money. 
   As an African-American woman who represents one of the poorest districts in the state of Florida, I am proud to say that Democrats are fighting for a budget that reflects the values of America's working families. For the first time in 6 years, the congressional budget resolution will deliver fiscal responsibility, economic prosperity, a strong national defense, affordable health care and energy prices, and strong public schools. 
   Let me give you some examples of the differences between the President's budget and the Democratic budget: 
   The President's budget has deficits as far as the eye can see with an increase of $507 billion over the next 5 years. The House Democratic budget lowers the deficit in 2008 and balances the budget in 5 years. 
   The President's budget cuts vital health care programs even when there are over 3 million Floridians without health insurance. The House Democratic budget puts children and families first by providing $50 billion to expand children's health insurance and creates a reserve fund that would allow Medicare improvements--such as increasing the reimbursement rate for physicians and improving the Medicare prescription drug program. 
   The President's budget fails to protect Americans here at home by slashing funding for the COPS program by 94 percent. COPS is regarded as an overwhelming success and has funded more than 118,400 police officers and sheriffs deputies. The House Democratic budget provides more homeland security dollars to fund the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, reject the President's cuts to first responders, and adequately address port security needs. 
   The President's budget forgets about the over 1.7 million veterans in Florida by cutting funds for their healthcare in 2009 and 2010 and imposing new health care fees on 1.3 million veterans. The House Democratic budget meets previously unmet needs for veterans by increasing funding for veterans' health care by $5.4 billion above current services. 
   The President's budget gives no relief to Americans struggling with high energy costs. Florida low-income energy assistance was slashed by $6.5 million and gas prices have increased approximately 69 percent since 2001. The House Democratic Budget expands renewable energy and energy efficiency by stimulating the economy with investments in the farm economy and in research to develop clean, sustainable energy alternatives to help America achieve energy independence in 10 years. 
   The President's budget betrays Florida's children by underfunding the No Child Left Behind Act for the 6th year. Nearly 160,000 children in Florida will go without promised help in reading and math. The House Democratic Budget has a $3 billion increase in funding for programs like No Child Left Behind, special education and aid to help students afford college. 
   In closing, I would like to reiterate that Democrats are committed to a new direction for America in which the interests of hardworking Florida families take priority over the special interests. This budget delivers fiscal responsibility, economic prosperity, a strong national defense, access to healthcare and high-quality public schools for the people in my district and for Americans overall.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week it was difficult to tell President Bush and Senator McCain apart. On the day when the stock markets fell 500 points, President Bush described it as nothing more than an ``adjustment,'' while Senator McCain declared the ``fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' 
   Are President Bush and Senator McCain serious, or are they out of touch? What about the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and are having trouble finding a new one simply because the Bush-McCain economy has shed 600,000 more jobs this year than they have created? What about middle class families who are worse off today than they were 8 years ago? They have seen their real wages fall over 8 years by $300.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5522, the Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Act of 2008. This bill would require the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, to issue rules regulating combustible industrial dusts, like sugar dust, that can build up to hazardous levels and explode. 
   Opponents of this bill claim that OSHA has enough existing standard and education materials to protect workers. However, I would strongly argue that the absence of clear OSHA standards puts thousands of American workers and innocent bystanders at risk from workplace hazards. Unfortunately, I have an example to back up my statement. 
   On December 19, 2007 there was a chemical explosion at the T2 Laboratories in Jacksonville, Florida. According to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, CSB, this explosion was one of the worse chemical accidents in their  10-year history. Unfortunately, this isn't an isolated incident. A year earlier, there was another explosion in Daytona Beach at the Bethune Point Wastewater Plant. These two incidents demonstrate a critical need for stronger OSHA regulations. 
   In 2002, following a series of fatal explosions and a large number of deaths and injuries caused by runaway chemical reactions, the CSB issued a report concluding that reactive incidents are ``a significant chemical safety problem'' and that OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, PSM standard, has ``significant gaps in coverage of reactive hazards.'' The study identified 167 serious reactive chemical accidents resulting in 108 fatalities in the U.S. over a 20 year period. The CSB therefore recommended that OSHA amend the PSM standard to better control reactive chemical hazards. 
   Reactive hazards rulemaking had been on OSHA's agenda during the Clinton administration as a result of a number of fatalities and a labor union petition, but the Bush administration removed it from the regulatory agenda. 
   OSHA's mission is to ensure employee safety and health and as OSHA is watching the progress of H.R. 5522, I ask that they review the 2002 recommendations by the Chemical Safety Board and revise the Process Safety Management standards to prevent further workplace accidents.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have waited a long time for this day. This is a great day. It is a day that the American people have been waiting for a very long time. 
   Helping the poor is a theme that is stressed throughout the Bible, but it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to help raise the standard. 
   I am so pleased today that we are going to have an opportunity to have a clean vote on raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. 
   You know, the sad thing is that a CEO before 12:00 earns more money than a person on minimum wage will earn all year long. In talking to some of the CEOs about it, they mention, maybe we are trying to help students or part-time workers. The truth of the fact is, we are raising the minimum wage. We are providing an additional $4,400 per year for a struggling family to make ends meet and keep up with the rising cost of living. 
   This bill is not about students and part-time workers. No, it is about the nearly 13 million full-time workers, many with families to care for, who earn the minimum wage. In my State of Florida, the increase would directly benefit over 200,000 workers and have a positive effect on over a half million people. 
   Today is a great day for America and for the American worker. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill. I hope the Senate passes this version as soon as possible so that we can provide immediate relief to our Nation's workers.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3495, the KIDS WiSH Act. 
   Before I start, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton for their work in bringing this bill through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also would like to thank Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Graves for their bipartisan support. Their leadership and their staff have been instrumental in strengthening the merits of the bill and the concept of this commission. Finally, I would like to thank the House leadership for bringing this important bill to the floor so quickly. 
   The KIDS WiSH Act will establish a National Commission on Children and Disasters that will conduct a comprehensive study to examine and assess the needs of children to prepare for, respond to and recover from all major disasters and emergencies. The bipartisan commission will report to the President and Congress on their findings, conclusions and recommendations to address the needs of children and emergencies. In addition, the commission will consider the need for a permanent national resource center on children and disasters that will be a resource for emergency managers, schools, housing agencies, transportation entities and other relevant organizations. 
   Disaster and emergencies strike all over this country, and they affect children in small and large numbers. This spring, Greensburg, Kansas, which had a population of 1,389, experienced a horrible tornado. Children aged 0-17 make up 25 percent of the population of Kansas. That translates into about 347 children who were affected. This may be a small number compared to Hurricane Katrina, but each of those children's lives were utterly changed after that one tornado. 
   In the San Diego area, as a result of the recent wildfires, nearly 850,000 people were evacuated. In California, the population is about 26 percent children  0-17, so that translates to roughly 220,000 children who had to be evacuated. On October 24, 2007, FEMA reported that 13,000-plus individuals were housed in shelters. That translates to roughly 3,500 children. 
   Since Hurricane Katrina, many improvements to our emergency management system have been made, but there is still much work to be done. The basic tenet of disasters and emergencies is to ``make a plan.'' You hear it in public service announcements all over Florida and the Gulf coast, and it is written on many of the materials distributed by FEMA. Make a plan, make a plan. 
   But, for all of that talk, we do not have a plan for children. Children are one of our most vulnerable populations, and their needs are unique and cannot be easily assumed from emergency plans for adults. 
   Earlier this year I met with the chief of the Division of Community Pediatrics from the University of Florida and he brought to my attention that emergency evacuation equipment is often brought for adults, but children cannot be transported in adult equipment, and often that type of equipment is missed. From needles and tubing to oxygen masks and ventilators, children need equipment that has been specifically designed for their size. 
   Do you know if the hospitals in your district are prepared for children in an emergency situation? Hospitals are just one of the many areas where improvements can be made for children in emergency situations and why the commission is needed. 
   More than 400,000 children under the age of 5 lived in and were evacuated from counties and parishes that were declared disaster areas by FEMA in response to Hurricane Katrina. In addition, 1,100 schools were closed immediately following Hurricane Katrina. Two years later, only 45 percent of New Orleans schools have reopened. Finally, the most startling statistic from Hurricane Katrina is that 5,192 children were missing or displaced and it took nearly 6 1/2 months to unite each child with their parent. However, the effects of disasters on children are not limited to events of this magnitude.     
   Additionally, in this day and age we cannot keep thinking that children will not be harmed in a terrorist attack. In 1995, nineteen children were killed and more than 80 children were injured at the Oklahoma City bombing. 
   More than 6,000 children were in the immediate area of Ground Zero during 9/11, and if the attacks were more widespread, it would have reached over 1.2 million public school students. 
   In the D.C. area we are painfully aware that during the sniper shooting, schools and children are not overlooked by terrorists. We must have a plan for children in the event of another terrorist attack. 
   I have been working hard to bring this issue to light. I led 23 other Members to call on FEMA to have an expert on children and disasters as a member of the National Advisory Council. I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill that will add $1 million specifically for children and disasters. 
   Finally, I held an important forum with experts from emergency management, pediatrics and disaster recovery to discuss how to prepare, respond to, and recover from all hazards for children. Over 100 people attended this briefing to show their support for the legislation. 
   As adults, we may think this is unnecessary; but once again, we must think how children are different. I encourage the commission to think outside the box. Children are a diverse group and the commission should remember children in the context of private schools, preschools, after-school programs, day care facilities, pregnant women, foster children, and orphanages. 
   Last year, Congress passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006. Congress has recognized how pets can slip through the cracks during an emergency, but has yet to have a plan for children in an emergency. 
   Children should not be forced to suffer through another learning experience like Hurricane Katrina. Congress must look forward and discover a comprehensive strategy for children and emergencies that may happen such as pandemic flu or a terrorist attack or a major earthquake. A national commission is imperative to making progress. 
   This commission will solidify some of the already good work that other organizations are doing and provide recommendations for better coordination at the local, State, and Federal levels. 
   I also would like to thank organizations who have supported this bill. I want to recognize the crucial support of Mark Shriver from Save the Children who has led the coalition of children's advocate groups. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert the list of groups into the Record at this point, and I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3495, the KIDS WiSH Act.  
   Save the Children, Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics, American Association of School Administrators, American Red Cross, Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, Catholic Charities USA, Child Welfare League of America, Children's Health Fund, Habitat for Humanity, March of Dimes, The Midwives Alliance of North America, National Assembly on School-Based Healthcare, National Association of Children's Hospitals, National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, National Association of Certified Professional Midwives, National Association of School Nurses, National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, Safermaternity.org, and White Ribbon Alliance.

   These water projects are extremely important to my home State of Florida and for the Nation as a whole and have been held hostage for far too long. 
   Like all transportation projects, Mr. Oberstar always said that our committee, the Committee on Infrastructure, is the committee that actually put America to work. And this bill will put America back to work, improve our communities, and create economic activity. 
   This legislation will also ensure that workers are paid a fair rate for their hard work. It is these workers' taxes that pay for these projects, and they deserve a fair wage that allows them to adequately provide for their families. 
   By delaying the passage of this much-needed legislation any further, we are doing a disservice to the people we represent. 
   Like so many Americans, it is hard for me to understand how President Bush can spend $600 billion on his never-ending war, but yet veto $23 billion in vital water and civil work projects for the cities and towns right here in America. This is just one more example of how out of touch this administration is. They live in a bubble. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this veto override and let's move forward and work on the next WRDA bill so we don't have to wait 6 more years.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise to offer an amendment that would add $1 million to the FEMA management and administration account so that children's disaster planning materials can be developed and implemented. 
   Children are often neglected when it comes to preparedness and response. Nothing shows this more than the chaotic evacuations during Hurricane Katrina when hundreds of children were separated from their parents or guardians because a simple system of writing down names of evacuated children was not implemented. 
   Children's unique needs are often overlooked because of the fallacy that children can be treated like ``little adults.'' Children are among the most vulnerable members of the population and their needs are vastly different. 
   For example, I had a meeting with the chief of the Division of Community Pediatrics from the University of Florida and he brought to my attention that emergency evacuation equipment is often bought for adults, but children can't be transported in adult equipment and often that type of equipment is missed. 
   My amendment would make sure children don't go unnoticed when we are thinking about preparedness materials. Children represent nearly 25 percent of the population, and they need their own set of disaster planning materials. Children should be learning the importance of making an emergency plan, what to ask their parents and about the need for an emergency contact and identification card. 
   In addition, children often take the preparedness message back home to their families. Involving and educating children is the best way to get many of the adults who don't always hear the planning message. Getting children ready for disasters can make the difference between success and failure. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to increase funding for children's disaster preparedness materials. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to grant additional funding to the Inspector General's office so that they may enforce section 8 and small disadvantaged business contracts at the Department of Homeland Security.  
   Procurement at the Department of Homeland Security increased 189 percent between 2003 and 2005, which was 11 times faster than the growth of the rest of the government. Yet according to the Federal Procurement Data System, the percentage of contracting for small disadvantaged businesses has decreased. In 2003, small disadvantaged businesses accounted for 16 percent of contracts. In 2004, the number decreased to 9.5 percent, and in 2005 the number decreased to 7.6 percent. If spending is increasing at the Department of Homeland Security, then why aren't minority and small business contracts increasing, too? 
   I've heard from several businesses about their frustration with being awarded Federal contracts as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and Women's Caucus, as well as talking with members from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Going around my district and speaking with many small businesses in general, they also feel like the government has shut them out. Of course, with the abundance of noncompetitive contracts in the Bush administration, it seems like the first place the Department does not look are minority businesses or small business. No-bid contracts go to large companies that are not minority-owned. Waste, fraud and abuse have been rampant at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   It has long been the policy of the Federal Government to assist minority and other ``socially and economically disadvantaged'' small businesses to become fully competitive and viable business concerns. This policy must be taken seriously by all agencies, especially the Department of Homeland Security. 
   This amendment is important to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Women's Caucus. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the longstanding policy for assisting minority and small, disadvantaged businesses. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ask support for my amendment to allow Orlando International Airport and Miami International Airport to be named as two of the seven airports selected to implement a pilot program to screen airport workers who enter or reenter security airport space. 
   My interest in this stems from a very serious security breach which occurred at the Orlando International Airport, OIA, earlier this year. 
   On March 5, a Comair customer service employee boarded a Delta flight from Orlando International to San Juan, carrying 13 handguns, 1 assault weapon and 8 pounds of marijuana. Although passengers and flight crews are required to pass through screening to obtain access to gates, mechanics and other airline employees move through the airport without being screened. 
   In fact, the men that were arrested had employee identification that allowed them to bypass screening altogether when they brought a duffel bag full of handguns into the airport. This serves as a perfect example of a striking gap in airline security, not only at OIA, but at airports nationwide. 
   Moreover, given an employee was willing to take the risk of smuggling illegal weapons and drugs into a flight for a few thousand dollars, one would certainly imagine that it would be possible that the airline employee could be bribed by well-financed terrorists to obtain access to the airport infrastructure. 
   In response to this incident, report language in the bill required a pilot program for seven airports nationwide to mandate the screening of all employees as prescribed in H.R. 1314. 
   Of the seven airport pilot projects mentioned in the report language, my amendment would require that the Orlando International Airport and the Miami International Airport be named two of the designated programs. Miami International, in fact, already had a program in place, while Orlando International has undertaken a plan to screen 100 percent of all of its employees. Given the heavy international traffic at both of these airports, I strongly believe that they serve as perfect places to begin a program which eventually needs to be implemented at all airports nationwide. 
   The reason I include Miami is because Miami can be used as a model, since the airport has had a program in place for nearly a decade and spends about $5 million per year for this type of security. The Miami program has reduced smuggling by all employees. Under this program, all airport and airline employees are screened, though not at the same area as the passengers or flight crews. 
   The Miami program also includes a provision that allows screening to instantly send a suspect's image to a New York center that operates around-the-clock with a staff of former NYPD technicians. 
   As you know, the State of Florida, in particular, thrives on tourism, which forms the backbone of the State economy. Obviously, those traveling in the State need to feel safe during their commute, and increasing and enforcing the security process for airline employees would serve as an important step toward achieving this goal. 
   I realize it is necessary to withdraw this amendment, and I am willing to do so, but this is a very, very serious situation not just for Florida, but for the entire country. I want all of us to work together to ensure that our system does not allow these huge security gaps to continue.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the CHAMP Act. The CHAMP Act is another achievement that the Democratic Congress can point to that is fulfilling the needs of the American people. 
   In my home State of Florida, KidCare--Florida's CHIP program--covered 303,595 children in 2006, but 718,603 children remain uninsured. The CHAMP Act could provide Florida with approximately $2.54 billion in new federal funding and an opportunity to get more children covered. States like Florida need to step up to the plate and fund their CHIP program to the fullest extent. 
   The CHAMP Act would provide continued health insurance to six million children already covered and add an additional five million children who currently lack health insurance nationwide. That alone should be enough to vote for this bill, but the Republicans continue to play political games. 
   Fortunately, the Republicans have no ground to stand on this bill and they know it. They are trapped in a corner crying about tax increases instead of supporting health care for five million children. Let me tell you, this is why your party is no longer in control--you've stopped listening to the people. 
   Opponents also say this is a fiscally irresponsible bill. Let me say that your party doesn't understand fiscal responsibility. The Republican party has run up the largest deficits in history and they call this bill fiscally irresponsible. We have spent over $600 billion on the President's war in Iraq and we can't spend less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through CHIP. Seventy-six percent of Americans believe that access to health insurance is more important than cutting taxes. 
   This bill will be one of the most important healthcare issues this Congress will deal with and the American public will know who voted for it. The number of uninsured children in the country is an embarrassment. The Democrats are making the American public a priority again and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill and vote for the children.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL BILL -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin with a quote from Coretta Scott King: ``Struggle is a never ending process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it every generation.'' 
   I rise today to talk about one of America's priorities in the emergency supplemental appropriation bill, and that is to fulfill the promise to help rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 
   In August of 2005, the American people saw something that was hard to believe. They saw a U.S. government that was incompetent, a government that was inept, and a government that did not care about its open people. 
   Unfortunately, 2 days ago, President Bush vetoed the emergency supplemental bill and showed the American people that things haven't changed. After the President vetoed the bill, he had the audacity to make the following statement: `` ..... the bill is loaded with billions of dollars in non-emergency spending that has nothing to do with fighting the war on terror. Congress should debate these spending measures on their own merits--and not as a part of an emergency funding bill for our troops.'' 
   Only two other people in the country believe that we are winning the war in Iraq, by the way. That's President Bush and Vice President Cheney. The cheese stands alone. The $1.3 billion for east and west bank levee protection and coastal protection isn't pork. The $30 million for K-12 education assistance has been debated and has been deemed essential. 
   The $25 billion for small business disaster loans will help rebuild; the $80 million for HUD rental assistance will bring people back home; the $4.3 billion for FEMA disaster recovery grants is an emergency for our fellow Americans in Louisiana and Mississippi who have been waiting 18 months for you to keep your promise to rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi. 
   Mr. President, you were wrong to veto this bill. I have been to New Orleans seven times and going back in June. Sadly, every time I look there, it look looks like a war zone. It is unbelievable that 18 months have passed and the most basic human needs have not yet been met; 18 months later, and residents are not able to move back. There is still debris everywhere, and people are without electricity 18 months later. The roads are not passable, no clean running water, not enough schools and teachers; 18 months later and no street signs, toxic fumes in the air and not enough police; 18 months later, this is unacceptable. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle made the statement over and over again about how we should pass a clean bill. Well, I have been elected 25 years, and I have never seen a clean bill yet. If the President or my Republican colleagues would have done their job 18 months ago, we wouldn't need to have these extra funds in the supplemental bill. It is shameful that the very people who write the checks and pay the taxes in our cities are not given the money they deserve. 
   I remember the President's press conference in Jefferson Square in New Orleans and his promise to rebuild. His veto showed the American people once again that he has no intention of living up to his promise. 
   The Democratic majority has done their job. They passed this bill. Sadly, the residents of Louisiana and Mississippi will have to keep waiting on you to remember your promise. The good citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi demand good government. This is responding to the caring, and it is also an example of not just talking the talk, but walking the walk.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are seeing a rebirth of the passenger and freight rail industry in this country, and it couldn't come soon enough. This week, Congress  is working on legislation that will help provide solutions to the energy crisis this Nation is facing. One sure way to do this is to increase the use of passenger and freight rail. 
   The only current mode of transportation that is greener than rail is your sneakers. Freight rail has made major gains in fuel efficiency through training and improved locomotive technology. A single intermodal train can take up to 280 trucks off of the highways. Today, one gallon of diesel fuel can move a ton of freight an average of 414 miles, a 76 percent improvement since 1980. 
   Passenger rail ability to reduce congestion is well known, with ridership numbers increasing steadily each year. One full passenger train can take up to 250-350 cars off of the road. 
   Passenger rail also consumes less energy than both automobiles and commercial airlines. Every industrialized country in the world is already using high-speed rail to effectively move citizens in an environmentally friendly way. Sadly, the United States used to be the leader in rail; now we're the caboose, and they don't even use cabooses anymore. Fortunately, we will be changing that with the upcoming passage of the Amtrak Reauthorization bill. 
   Today, we celebrate the contributions of our Nation's rail once again by recognizing North Platte, Nebraska, as ``Rail Town, USA.'' 
   North Platte has a long and storied history as a railroad town. During World War II, North Platte hosted up to 20 trains full of soldiers each day, and today is home to the Bailey Yard, which is considered the largest rail classification yard in the world, handling 10,000 railroad cars each day. 
   From 1941-1946, more than six million service men and women were greeted by North Platte volunteers who provided food, needed supplies and hospitality to the World War II veterans and provided care baskets to wounded soldiers returning home. 
   I want to commend Congressman Smith for this legislation and thank the town of North Platte, Nebraska, for the contributions to our brave soldiers during World War II. 
   I urge Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Once again I want to add that for better than 4 years, day in and day out, over 50,000 people contributed food, money and efforts to one of the proudest moments in our history during World War II. Day in and day out, from early in the morning until the last train would leave at night, between 2,000 and 5,000 soldiers and sailors  would be fed nearly 200 loaves of bread, 100 pounds of meat, 50 pounds of coffee and over 100 quarts of milk. More than 300 organizations made sandwiches, boiled eggs, fried chicken and baked cakes and pies. The war wounded were provided with razors, canes, toothbrushes and care baskets to make their return home a welcome one. One of the most famous residents of North Platte was Colonel William F. Cody, best known as Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill made North Platte his home for more than 30 years. 
   Today North Platte is the home of Bailey Yard and operated by Union Pacific Railroad. It is considered the largest rail classification yard in the world. Every 24 hours, Bailey Yard handles over 10,000 railroad cars. Bailey Yard handles daily an average of 135 trains bound for cities as far distant as the east, west and gulf coasts of America, as well as the Canadian and Mexican borders. 
   I really want to be one of the ones to offer congratulations and our thanks as a grateful people to North Platte. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I don't want the people at home to get confused. Today we are honoring the people of North Platte, USA, for their major contribution as far as rail is concerned. But I think that there is no stronger bill more that we can do in this Congress than to pass the Amtrak bill. I want to be clear. I mention that Congress is working on legislation that would provide solutions to the energy crisis. And the solution, in my opinion, is not just drilling. That is one of the comprehensive proposals. 
   But the major solution to our problem in this country as far as energy is concerned is not just to provide drilling off the Florida coast. It is also to provide rail service. We, in this country, as I say over and over and over again, are the caboose. The caboose. And we don't use cabooses in trains anymore. I went from downtown Paris to downtown Brussels, over 200 miles, 1 hour and 15 minutes, downtown Barcelona to downtown Madrid, 300 miles, in 2 1/2 hours. That is the future of our country. We have to move people, goods and services, if we are going to be competitive with the rest of the world. Our competition is moving. We need to move America and to understand the solution to the problem is not by drilling and drilling alone. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. In closing, once again let's thank the people of North Platte for what they have done during World War II. Also, as we move forward in discussing energy, we need comprehensive energy. One thing that was missing was coal. We have enough coal in this country for 600 years. I know that burning coal sometimes pollutes the air, but any country that can go to the moon, we can come up with a way to burn coal and not be dependent. 
   So we need a comprehensive approach to energy. The answer is not just drilling. We need comprehensive approaches to dealing with our moving people, goods and services so we can be competitive with our competition.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution which requires our support for our brave troops and the American military, yet also expresses disapproval of President Bush's decision to deploy additional troops to the area. 
   My colleagues, the most serious vote any Member of Congress will ever take will be to send men and women to war. I support the troops 100 percent. Yet when you have your head in the lion's mouth, how do you get it out? 
   I did not vote for the war when it came before the House of Representatives back in 2002. I never supported  this war. Yet, I do not blame my colleagues who did because their vote was based on false, twisted information provided by President Bush. From the very beginning of this conflict, President Bush has intentionally misled the American public by supplying them with false grounds for going to war, and now he is inventing reasons for us to stay there. 
   As President Bush begins to lay out his case for expanding this terrible war into Iran, we see the false rhetoric, the same war drumbeats in the background, drumming up support for the attack on Iran. Since we have never found a link between al Qaeda and Iraq, we are trying to hide our failure to control the civil war in Iraq by blaming Iran for supplying weapons to Iraqi insurgents. There is no proof and no one is certain this is under the direction of the Iranian leadership. Again, the President is telling the American people this is true, but why should we believe him? I know what the Bush administration is capable of doing. They will use any means necessary to achieve their ends, even if it means doctoring up the information supplied to Congress and to the international community to wage a war over oil. 
   They have provided all the justifications, all the sanctimony, frightening the American people into supporting a $600 billion war in Iraq, supposedly to deter terror, but in reality it is having the opposite effect. My colleagues, this war needs to come to an end. The American people want the troops home. This was the message sent loud and clear to the Bush administration during the November elections. Yet they for some reason just didn't get the message. Nearly 70 percent of the American people want us out of Iraq. Yet, President Bush continues to ignore that. We have already spent over half a trillion dollars over there. Let me repeat. $600 billion. There was even a period between 2003 and 2004 when our military was carrying huge wraps of $100 bills over to Iraq. 
   Look at this cruise ship. I want you to imagine a cruise ship full of $100 bills. We sent it over to Iraq. Now, let me tell you something, folks. A billion dollars is even a lot of money here in Washington. $100 bills, a billion dollars. Let me tell you what that would pay for our veterans. $1.7 billion would fund over 1.5 million veterans in category 8 that we are not funding today. Let me repeat. Over 1.5 million veterans we could serve if we could recoup just $1 billion, and we have sent over about $9 billion that we cannot account for. 
   Folks, I am going to give the Bush administration an F, and I am going to give the past Congress an F for giving him a blank check. 
   We all have the opportunity to have a serious vote for our troops and a vote for the American people. I say vote ``yes'' on the resolution.

I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Mr. Mica and Mr. Duncan and Chairwoman Johnson and Mr. Pascrell for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor; and I want to congratulate my good friend, Eddie Bernice Johnsonn, for bringing her first bill to the floor this week as chairwoman of the Water Resources Subcommittee. 
   I am so pleased that our committee, with the guidance of our transportation guru, Mr. Oberstar, will be making access to a safe wastewater infrastructure and a clean water supply a top priority. 
   There are places in my district and in the State of Florida where the sewer and water system are as bad as some  systems that I have seen in Third World countries. Let me repeat. There are places in my district that remind me of being in a Third World country when it comes to water and sewer, and this infrastructure is what separates us from those countries. This is why cleaning up these systems is so important and why this legislation is so necessary. 
   This bill provides $1.8 billion over 5 years to municipalities and States to improve and prevent sewer overflow by improving the aging and obsolete sewer systems that plague many towns and cities. These improvements will not just protect the environment but will improve overall public health. 
   One of the greatest things about serving on the Transportation Committee is that our committee actually puts people to work in good-paying jobs that benefit the public. We all talk a lot on this floor about supporting hardworking Americans, but some people don't believe that those workers deserve fair wages for their hard work. This is why it is so important that we support Davis-Bacon and ensure that everyone who works hard can experience the American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with an apology. Last week, I was in the grocery store in Jacksonville, Florida. A veteran working part time told me about a friend who was at Walter Reed, and he had pictures showing the problems that were occurring there. He walked me to the car and said that there was no way he would ever vote again for a Republican after seeing what the pictures showed. 
   I couldn't believe what he was describing to me of a military facility. And I told him, ``You can't believe everything that you see on the Internet.'' The next day, the very next day, the story was in the Washington Post. I am going back to that grocery store to personally apologize to that veteran. The fact that an active duty soldier was treated this way is inconceivable. 
   I did not vote for this war. The military is doing the job they were sent to do. There was a flaw in the mission from the beginning, and the flaw lies with us. American soldiers have performed admirably under trying conditions, conditions they were not trained for and conditions they should not be in. We won the war but lost the occupation. Our soldiers deserve better when they get back. 
   We can send 484 tons of money, $12 billion, to Iraq for who knows what, but when it comes to the well-being of those soldiers, there is no money. According to the VA, it will cost $1.7 billion to include all veterans in the VA health care system. 
   What are the priorities of this administration? There are all kinds of justifications, all kinds of sanctimony, frightening the American people into supporting a $600 billion war in Iraq. We have a $3 trillion budget, and we are sending nearly $1 trillion to a country of 28 million people. 
   We are building an embassy in Baghdad of 104 acres. This is six times larger than the United Nations compound in New York and two-thirds the acreage of Washington's National Mall. The embassy compound, 21 buildings on 104 acres, is the size of Vatican City and will be the largest in the world. It will employ over 5,500 people. The embassy will cost over $1 billion. This is the priority of this Bush administration. 
   My colleagues, this war needs to come to an end. The American people want the troops home. This was the message sent loud and clear to the Bush administration during the November elections. Yet for some reason, they just don't get the message. Nearly 70 percent of the American people want us out of Iraq, and 100 percent deplore the treatment the administration is giving the veterans at the time of their most urgent need. 
   I will go back to Jacksonville and apologize to this veteran. I will be able to look him in the eye and say that this will not stand. We will make sure our soldiers come back to the best care this great Nation can provide. 
   I am reminded, in closing, of the words of the first President of the United States, George Washington, whose words are worth repeating at this time: 
   ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.''

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairmen OBERSTAR and COSTELLO and Ranking Members MICA and PETRI for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. This bill could not come at a better time for the traveling public. 
   Airlines on-time performance is at its lowest rate since the Department of Transportation began keeping records in 1995. And this is happening at the same time that the Department of Transportation is predicting a tripling of passenger and cargo by 2025. This is why we need this bill passed so we can provide funds for increased capacity, safety enhancements, and overall system improvements. 
   This bill addresses an important issue in my district by preserving the Military Airport Program, MAP, as a set-aside within the Airport Improvement Program. The MAP program provides critical support to those communities which have been given the responsibility of converting closed military bases to civilian use. The participation of the Cecil Field Airport, which is just outside of Jacksonville, is a prime example of how this program can successfully translate former military airfields to commercial service that, in turn, have strengthened the Nation's aviation system and, in the case of  Cecil Field, also continues to include uses by the Air National Guard and Reserve units, making this a win-win for the community and for the military. 
   MAP grants also support projects that are generally not eligible for AIP funds, but which are typically needed for successful civilian conversion such as surface parking lots, fuel farms, hangars, utility systems, access roads, and cargo buildings. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman for guiding this bill to the floor, and I would encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (NATIONAL TRAIN DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   National Train Day celebrates the 139th anniversary of the ``golden spike,'' which was driven into the final tie in Utah and marked the completion of our Nation's first transcontinental railroad in 1869. 
   This weekend I celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout my district, including press conferences and events in Jacksonville, Winter Park, and Sanford Auto Train station. We had a great turnout at every event, and I heard firsthand from people who use Amtrak every day to go to work and visit friends and family all over the country. 
   As Chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, I have had the privilege to see firsthand passenger rail systems in other countries. I have taken high-speed trains from Brussels to Paris, 200 miles, 1 1/4 hours; and from Barcelona to Madrid, 300 miles, 2 1/2 hours; and the advantage for travelers and for business are tremendous. We need to catch up with the world, and with gas prices edging toward $4 a gallon, some places $5 and $6, now is the perfect time for us to begin to make serious investment in passenger rail. 
   Indeed, Amtrak ridership and revenue has never been stronger. In 2007, Amtrak set a new record for ridership, exceeding 25.8 million passengers. In the same year, ticket revenues increased by 11 percent, to more than $1.5 billion. For my State of Florida, Amtrak expenditures for goods and services in the State soared to nearly $40 million last year, and Amtrak currently employs over 700 Florida residents. 
   I have traveled all over the country and have conducted many transportation roundtable events that feature rail and its importance, and the people I have talked to love Amtrak. It is a great way to commute to work, takes cars off our congested highways, and improves the environment. In many areas of the country, it is the only means of public transportation available. 
   Now what I can't understand is why the Bush administration, again, in the midst of sharp increases in gas prices, continues in its efforts to destroy passenger rail in this country. Every industrialized country in the world is investing heavily in rail infrastructure because they realize that this is the future of transportation. But sadly, as their systems get bigger and better, our system gets less and less money. 
   While the administration has spent nearly a trillion dollars on the war in Iraq, it continues to decrease their requests for Amtrak. This year they only requested $800 million for Amtrak's 25.8 million passengers. Well, that is an improvement from zero. For Amtrak, just one week's investment in Iraq would significantly improve passenger rail across the country for an entire year. This is another perfect example of how out of touch this administration is because I can assure the President that there is a whole lot more support for Amtrak in this country than there is for the war in Iraq. 
   Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about Amtrak, and it is important for people to know the facts. Ridership numbers and ticket revenue are at a record level. Outstanding debt has been reduced by $600 million over the past 6 years, and many major infrastructure projects have been completed. And this has been achieved with a workforce that has been reduced by over 4,000 employees. We still have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to Amtrak, and it took a major step forward last week when we introduced legislation reauthorizing Amtrak at a level that would allow it to grow and prosper. The legislation developed by the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. JAMES OBERSTAR and myself, and introduced with Congressmen MICA and SHUSTER, provides over $2 billion a year for capital and operating grants, $500 million per year for developing State passenger corridors, $345 million per year to pay down debt, $345 million per year for high-speed rail programs, $600 million to start working on constructing a new tunnel through Baltimore, and requires a plan for restoring service to the Sunset Limited, one of my top priorities. 
   Major infrastructure improvements are also necessary to improve the safety and security of the system and its passengers and workers. Amtrak has and will continue to play a critical role in evacuating and transporting citizens during national emergencies. Unfortunately, it is also a prime target for those who wish to harm us and we must provide resources to make the system less vulnerable. 
   Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower created the national highway system that changed the way we travel in this country. Today we need to do the same thing with our rail system, and with Amtrak reauthorization we are doing just that. 
   The United States used to have a first class passenger rail system. However, after years of neglect, we are now the caboose, and they don't even use cabooses anymore. The American people deserve better, and I believe our Amtrak reauthorization bill will go a long way to restoring the American passenger system.  
   I encourage my colleagues to show their support for our Nation's rail system and its employees by holding events at our local commuter train stations any time during the year, and I would also encourage Members to cosponsor H.R. 6003, the Amtrak reauthorization bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate that 50 years ago, Eisenhower created a national highway system that changed America. Today we need to do the same thing with our rail system; and with this Amtrak reauthorization, we're doing just that. 
   The United States of America used to be the first as far as passenger rail was concerned. And I say it over and over again, now we are the caboose. And we don't use cabooses anymore. The American people need and deserve better. 
   Let me also mention that joining us on celebrating Amtrak National Train Day were 150 ladies from the Hope Chapel Church who rode from Jacksonville to Winter Park. And also, we had over 60 activities throughout the country. Participating in those activities were the Harlem Globetrotters and many Members of Congress. 
   I, in closing, am very excited about moving this country forward as far as making sure that we are no longer the caboose. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. I want to thank Chairmen OBERSTAR and THOMPSON for working together to bring this important legislation to the floor. 
   For too long, we have neglected the security of our rail and transit system, and this legislation will go a long way to make up for this. 
   March 11 marked the third anniversary of the train bombing in Madrid, where 191 people were killed and 2,050 were injured. Since that terrible terrorist attack, additional bombings have occurred in London and India, killing hundreds more people. It is obvious that we must be ready for a similar attack here in our own country, but, sadly, we are not. 
   Mr. Chairman, each year more Americans ride on rail and transit systems than they do on planes, yet the money we are putting in security is a mere fraction of what we devote to aviation security. In 2006, the Federal Government spent $4.7 billion for airline security, yet only $136 million for rail and transit systems. Five times more people take trains over planes each day, yet we spend 35 times more on aviation security than we do on rail and transit security. This is not acceptable. 
   Chairman DEFAZIO and I recently held a hearing on rail and transit security, and what we found was discouraging. Since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security has failed to issue a strategy to secure our rail and transit infrastructure, and the Transportation Security Administration has not completed a risk assessment of these systems. 
   Additionally, the rash of international terrorist bombings means that terrorists are getting smarter. Their future attacks will be harder to prevent. The window to secure our rail and transit infrastructure is closing quickly, and we need to act. While the Department of Transportation has done the most work of all agencies to secure this segment, it is obvious that much more work needs to be done. 
   I am glad that the manager's amendment will require DHS to work with the DOT to improve our Nation's rail and transit security system. It is hard to believe that almost 6 years after 9/11 we still have not addressed the rail and transit security. But election brings changes, and I am glad that we, the new congressional leadership, have common sense to take steps to protect the millions of people who use our Nation's many rail and transit systems. 
   The legislation on the floor today takes important steps to address our Nation's rail and transit security. This bill requires comprehensive security plans, strengthens whistleblower protection for workers, mandates security training, improves communications and intelligence sharing, authorizes a high level of grant funding for Amtrak, the freight railroads and public transit providers, and provides funding for safety improvements to the tunnels in New York, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. 
   Most importantly, it ensures our communities, first responders, transit and rail workers have the resources they need to keep their systems safe and secure; and it does it through a coordinated effort between the Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation. 
   While we may lag behind other countries' efforts to protect transit and rail workers, I am glad that our new congressional leadership is taking steps to correct this problem. 
   H.R. 1401 will go a long way to protect our Nation's millions of transit and rail passengers, while protecting the communities they travel through and keeping the trains running on time. 
   I encourage my colleagues to safeguard their constituents and support this long-overdue rail and security legislation.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. This amendment jeopardizes the safety and security of over 2 million Amtrak passengers and is a huge step backwards in protecting the Nation's transportation infrastructure from harm. 
   Amtrak was a first responder during Hurricane Katrina, delivering food and supplies and helping to evacuate thousands of gulf region residents when President Bush and his administration were nowhere to be found. Now they are becoming a key part in each State's future evacuation plan. 
   I was in New York City shortly after September 11 when the plane leaving JFK airport crashed into the Bronx. Along with many of my other colleagues in both the House and the Senate, I took Amtrak back to Washington. I realized once again just how important Amtrak is to the American people and how important it is for this Nation to have alternate modes of transportation. 
   Vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Thank you so much for your leadership, Congressman from Miami, my good friend. 
   Let me just say I just finished with Gator Radio, and they asked me the question, What is the role of Congress, what can we do about stopping the President from expanding the war? And I was just on the radio talking to the community and I have gotten some call back, what can we do as a Congress? 
   I tell people all the time I did not vote for the war, but I support the troops. And you have got your head in the lion's mouth. How do you get it out? And the question is what can we do as a Congress to stop the expansion? Because I think the speech that the President gave about expanding it to 20,000 troops, that is not what he was saying. I think he was saying that he doesn't need to come to this Congress to decide that he is going into Iran or that he is going into other places, and so there is clearly an expansion of the war. And what is our role as Members of Congress when the President of the United States does not respect the Congress and does not feel that we are coequal branches and that he does not have to come to us to get permission to expand this war? The students want to know. I want to know what to tell them.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. You know, we had a closed-door briefing yesterday, and the important point that I made is that every Member, all 435 Members of this House of Representatives have the responsibility for the security of this country. And I think we have more of a responsibility than just to give this President a blank check. And I think we owe it to this country to make sure we get more of some kind of response other than we are just expanding, and not really deal with us in a very constructive way. 
   The second point, and I have just got two quick points, and I have a plane to catch. On the area of health care, the President talked about health care, and I am one Member that would vote for it. I believe we should have universal health care. But you have to, always dealing with this administration, it is always in the details. Now he is talking about taking money from public hospitals. And when we say public hospitals, you have got one, I have got Shands, but you have got Jackson Memorial. Taking money from public hospitals, that is unacceptable. That is the only safety net that we have. And so that is one proposal that shouldn't arrive here, but when it does, it should be dead on arrival. 
   And the last point, I was disappointed, and I guess everybody in the gulf region was disappointed, there was no discussion about the gulf region, none whatsoever. Nothing about Katrina. Now, the American people, they saw something with Katrina that they didn't like. Not only did they see a government that was inept, uncaring, but incompetent, and yet nothing. 
   I talked to an 82-year-old lady on Thursday who 3 months before Katrina, she paid off her house. Paid off her house 3 months before Katrina. To this day she is homeless and hasen't received a penny from all of the dollars that we have appropriated. Now, we have a responsibility to this lady just like we do, we are insisting, that we put almost $500 billion in Iraq and said that, oh, they don't have to pay it back. But every dime that we put into New Orleans, we are going to say they have got to pay it back. I am sure it doesn't have anything to do that they are people of color. 
   But I have got to say we have got our challenges. I want to thank all of you 30-something-plus for your leadership on the floor and keeping these issues before the American people.

And as far as veterans are concerned, I am the second person on the committee, and I have been here for over 14 years, and I have been on that committee because I think it is so important that people that give their most, that we have got to make sure that we pay them back. And I am concerned that in the past under this administration, that is where we have cut. We have cut veterans programs, and they are coming back, and they need everything. I have gone out to Bethesda, and I am planning that we all go out there to Bethesda, and every veteran in every room needed casework and assistance. 
   So, basically we are not doing our duty, not taking care of those men and women when they come back wounded after giving their all for this country. We have got a responsibility in the Constitution, coequal branches. This is the people's House, and we should speak up and make sure that we fund programs that will benefit those veterans.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. I want to start out by thanking Chairmen OBERSTAR and CUMMINGS and Ranking Members MICA and LATOURETTE for all of their hard work on this bill. 
   We have given the Coast Guard so much responsibility, and they have been up to the challenge. 
   I have great respect for my colleague from California, but I rise to express my serious concern with her pending amendment. As a Member from the State of Florida, which has 14 ports and numerous cruise lines, I have a particular interest in the cruise industry. The cruise industry is one of the most important economic engines in the State of Florida. Over 5 million passengers embarked from Florida in 2005 and the industry contributed more than $6 billion in direct spending. In addition, the cruise industry is the second largest employer for Florida, generating more than 125,000 jobs. 
   Before coming to Congress I owned a travel agency, and I can tell you that a cruise is one of the most cost-effective, safe and enjoyable vacations one can take. In fact, I recently sent my mother on a cruise. 
   The cruise industry is highly regulated by State, Federal and international laws. They ensure that passengers are safe and have a sound safety and security record. It is apparent from the FBI statistics that crime against U.S. passengers on cruise ships are very rare. 
   The proposed amendment would unfairly penalize the cruise industry and require the public posting of crime allegations, organized by the name of the cruise line. No other private industry is required to provide such information on an Internet site. 
   The bill unfairly penalizes the cruise industry without any evidence or justification for this measure. 
   Requiring the reporting of allegations of crimes onboard ships would be misleading to the public as there is no distinction between an allegation and an actual crime committed. That is why if a local government requires the reporting of allegations of crime, no specific business is identified since in many instances these allegations are unfounded. 
   In closing, I will continue to work to make sure that the cruise industry is one of the safest industries in this country.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 3 years since the train bombing in Madrid, almost 2 years since the transit bombing in London, and nearly a year since the commuter rail bombings in Bombay, India; yet the Bush administration has done nothing to protect the Nation's freight and transit rail systems and its millions of passengers. 
   We cannot keep treating our rail infrastructure as second-class citizens. We have dedicated billions of dollars to repair the rail system in Iraq but have done little to invest in the security upgrades needed right here in America. 
   Another perfect example of falling down on the job is the administration repeatedly zeroing out the Port Security Grant program, which is one of the few sources for a port to improve anti-terrorist measures in their facilities. 
   Passing this bill will be the first step in a long road to protecting the people of this Nation and making sure our communities, our first responders, and our transportation workers are safe. 
   In December 2005, the 9/11 Commission gave the administration and Congress five Fs and 12 Ds. An example of one of these F grades is in providing a risk-based allocation of homeland security.

   The BCS Championship game between the University of Florida Gators and the Ohio State University Buckeyes last night was a clash of the titans and history in the making. 
   My alma mater, the University of Florida, became the first school in NCAA history to hold national titles in football and men's basketball at the same time. Only six Division I schools have ever won a football and men's basketball national championship since 1936, and never in the same year. 
   Thanks to Head Coach Urban Meyer, the Florida coaching staff, and the outstanding Gator football team, we finished the season with a 13-1 record. 
   I want to congratulate the University of Florida for not only being the best athletic school in the country but also the best in academia. 
   The Gators, through persistent offense and an overwhelming defense, defeated the Ohio State University Buckeyes 41-14. They earned 21 first downs, 370 total yards, and did not turn the ball over on offense. The defense held the opponents to only eight first downs, 82 total yards, and sacked the quarterback five times, for 51 yards. 
   No doubt about it, the best team won the National Championship. Go Gators!

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, as a Member from Florida, I rise in strong support of the Homeowners' Defense Act, H.R. 3355. 
   The terribly high cost for homeowners paying property insurance in my State of Florida, as well as for those on the Gulf Coast, and as we saw just recently, in California, has become a growing concern for homeowners. We saw what happened after hurricane Katrina and Rita and the four hurricanes that hit my district in Florida back in 2004. 
   These hurricanes, and other recent natural disasters, have led the insurance companies to limit their exposure to such disasters by outright pulling out, or reducing their risk. And this back peddling on their obligations on the part of the insurance industry has resulted in homeowner insurance rates rising by 100 percent to over 600 percent in higher-risk areas. This is entirely unacceptable. How can homeowners possibly afford this? This is just outrageous. We need to take action and step in. Just last week we saw the insurance companies out in California saying they will not provide insurance to hundreds of thousands of people that lost their homes in the terrible wildfires that hit the coast, all the way from LA to the Mexican border. 
   This is why people buy insurance: to protect themselves. How is it then that after disaster after disaster can we just sit back and allow these companies to pull out of the market. 
   Rising insurance rates are affecting homeowners across the country, not just in Florida. Clearly, the insurance market is not working, and it is time to put through a plan to stabilize the market and lower insurance rates for consumers.

   I rise in support of H.R. 6832, the Veterans' Programs Extension and Construction Authorization Act of 2008. I am pleased at the construction that has occurred in the State of Florida. My State has the largest elderly veterans population in the country. Everyone enjoys the warm weather, and veterans are no different. It is high time that we build the facilities that will take care of the heroes and sheroes. 
   In addition, this bill increases the authorization for the construction of a new VA medical center in Orlando. We have waited over 25 years for this facility, and we have construction delays. We cannot allow construction delays because of the lack of money due to increased energy costs or inflation. It would be criminal to do this. 
   In addition, this bill increases the authorization by $51 million to fund patient privacy at the Gainesville Medical Center. We need to make sure our veterans are treated with respect. 
   Earlier this year, this Congress passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriation under the leadership of Chairman Chet Edwards. I appreciate him including funds for these projects in the bill, along with the continuing development of the medical centers in Florida. 
   I urge the passing of the bill and continued support for our Nation's veterans. May God continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   With House Concurrent Resolution 336, we honor the sacrifices and contributions made of our disabled veterans. The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have added well over 30,000 of our sons and daughters to the roles of veterans disabled in defense of our Nation, with the number continuing to grow. 
   Collectively, there are approximately 2.8 million veterans receiving compensation for disability incurred in the line of duty. This resolution calls for the establishment of a single week dedicated annually to each and every one of our Nation's disabled veterans. 
   What better time would there be for groups large and small, national and local, private and public, to come together and remember in their own way the sacrifices of the Nation's heroes? Those great Americans gave the most for the least. They have earned our lasting remembrance and much more. 
   It is far too easy for many to forget the true costs of war, to forget the deaths of our servicemen and to ignore the wounds of those who return. It is too easy for too many of us to think that the cost of war ends when the last soldier returns. 
   Our disabled veterans continue to serve our country in so many ways, bearing their wounds as a reminder to all that freedom and liberty are not free. The men and women who return wounded and disabled from combat, and service to our Nation, remind us of the terrible price we pay, not only in costs measured in dollars, but the costs measured in lives lost and changed. 
   It is therefore right and proper that we remember the service and sacrifice of our disabled veterans and pay tribute and honor to them during this week of Disabled American Veterans Week. 
   When called, they answered. When needed, they served. All Americans owe them a debt of gratitude and a heartfelt remembrance for their sacrifice and service. I am reminded of the words of the first President of the United States, George Washington, whose words are worth repeating at this time. ``The willingness with which our people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportioned as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country.'' 
   It is part of my service and duties to visit the veterans' hospitals and clinics  in the areas I travel to. I recently visited the medical center in Puerto Rico, dedicated a new clinic in Orange City, Florida, and, before that, the Medical Center in New Orleans. 
   We have been funding the VA and veterans health care at record levels, giving the VA the largest increase in funding in the history of the United States. It is our duty to oversee the VA to make sure that they are spending the money properly in the best interests of our brave men and women who defend the rights and freedom of our great Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week, on June 6, we celebrated the anniversary of one of our greatest military accomplishments and an historic event that changed the face of our Nation and the world. 
   On June 6, 1944, the largest seaboard invasion in history began the 2-month Battle of Normandy. The D-day invasion began during the night, and continued with air and naval attacks and an amphibious attack in the early morning hours. 
   The D-day operation of June 6, 1944 brought together the land, air and sea forces of the Allied armies in what become known as the largest invading force in human history. Operation Overlord landed five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. 
   The invasion force included 7,000 ships and landing craft manned by 195,000 Navy personnel from eight Allied countries. Almost 133,000 troops from England, Canada and the United States landed on D-day. Casualties during the landing was over 10,000. 
   New Orleans is the home of a wonderful museum, the National World War II Museum. This museum opened its doors on June 6, 2000, and paid tribute not only to the D-day but all of the efforts in World War II. One of the reasons it is located in New Orleans is it was the home of Andrew Jackson Higgins. 
   The historian, Steven Ambrose, reported that General Eisenhower once told them that Higgins was the man who won the war for us. Eisenhower explained to him that if Higgins had not designated and built the LCVPs, we never could have landed over the open beach. The whole strategy of the war would have been different. 
   According to the National World War II Museum, the Higgins work force was the first in New Orleans to be racially integrated. This work force shattered production records, turning out more than 200,000 boats, including 12,500 LCVPs, or Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel, by the end of the war. 
   General Eisenhower's D-day message read: You are about to embark upon the greatest crusade, toward which we have strived these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you, and hopes and praise of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. 
   The world still recalls D-day, and the efforts of the United States and our Allies to end fascism in Europe and across the globe. It is fitting that we recall these accomplishments, and this day, and the service and sacrifice that hastened the end of World War II. 
   The world still looks to us for leadership for leadership and to be a beacon to illustrate the path ahead. Let us always strive to provide this light, this leadership and this wisdom to do what is right. 
   Last August I had the honor and privilege to visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France. While there I laid a wreath of flowers in honor of the soldiers that fought and died at Normandy and visited the graves of Floridians who gave their life fighting the Nazis. 
   Tori Robinson, an American gospel singer based in Paris, also a constituent of mine, sung at the ceremony. Her version of God bless America brought people from all over the memorial. There this honor was shared by all visitors in this holy place. 
   I want to take a special note to honor Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for their hard work in getting funds for this new Normandy Visitors Center appropriated. My visit to this center followed theirs, which was just dedicated on June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of D-day. 
   This visitors center truly paid tribute to the soldiers who stormed those beaches and gave visitors a true sense of what these men and their loved ones was going through during the war that led up to the D-day invasion. 
   I encourage all Americans to visit this hallowed site. Most of the visitors are from Europe and come to honor the sacrifice of the young Americans made for their freedom. 
   Many brave men and women died on this day, 64 years ago, to restore the freedom we enjoy today. Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms only God knows, reads just one of the 9,387 grave markers at the American cemetery in Normandy, France. We honor them by remembering and this resolution calls us to remember. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, 50 years ago President Eisenhower created the national highway system which changed the way we travel in this country. Today, we need to do the same thing with passenger rail and make the level of investment necessary for us to become the most successful in the 21st century. That is why I am so excited about House bill 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, which was introduced by Mr. Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, subcommittee Ranking Member Shuster, and myself. 
   Amtrak is extremely valuable to our country. It takes cars off the road that are already congested. It reduces congestion in the sky, and it's better for the environment. 
   In many areas of the country, Amtrak is the only mode of transportation available. They have shown major increases in ridership, too, as ridership has increased in 8 of the 9 last years and reached a record level of 25.8 million passengers just last year. And with the cost of gas potentially rising to $5 a gallon, there would be even more riders lining up for Amtrak. 
   Unfortunately, for many years Amtrak had been given just enough money to live alone, never getting the necessary funding to make serious improvement in the system. The hydraulic electric system is 70 years old, 65 percent of the bridges were built in the 1920s, and several tunnels which trains travel through every day were built in the 1800s. 
   In 2005, Amtrak conducted a comprehensive review of its capital needs. The review determined that Amtrak should invest $4.2 billion to bring their infrastructure to the state of good repair. Today, with the backlog of major bridges and tunnel work, the necessary investment capital has approached an estimated $6 billion. 
   As other countries continue to invest tens of billions of dollars each year to improve their passenger rail system, we are falling further and further behind by deferring much-needed improvements to our system. We must find a way to speed up Amtrak bylaws of repair work and bring its assets to a good state of repair so that Amtrak can concentrate on increasing capacity, increasing speed, developing new facilities, and planning for the future. 
   These major infrastructure improvements are also necessary to improve the safety and security of the system and its passengers and workers. Amtrak has and will continue to play a critical role in evacuation and transportation systems during national emergencies. Unfortunately, it is also a prime target for those who wish to harm us, and we must provide resources to make the system less vulnerable. 
   I'm looking forward to working with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to pass important legislation.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. The United States used to have a strong passenger rail system. Now we're at the caboose, and they don't even use cabooses anymore. 
   The American people deserve better, and I believe that the Amtrak reauthorization bill will go a long way to bring the use to its rightful place as the world leader in passenger rail. 
   In closing, I went from downtown Brussels to downtown Paris, 200 miles,  1 1/4 hours; downtown Barcelona to downtown Madrid, 2 1/2 hours. 
   We will move forward with high-speed rail in this country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have never supported the war in Iraq. From the very outset of the conflict, I have stood as an ardent opponent of the war, and voted against the War Resolution, House Joint Resolution 114, which ``authorized the use of United States Armed Forces against Iraq,'' when it came before the House of Representatives on October 8, 2002. I have argued from the beginning of this conflict that the President intentionally misled the American public by supplying them with spurious grounds for going to war. 
   I cannot, in good conscience, return to my district over the Memorial Day recess having cast a vote to continue funding, and henceforth, provide financial support for the continuation of this horrible war. Moreover, the bill's lack of a timetable for troop withdrawal is not acceptable. This is a war without any end in sight, without any sort of deadlines or oversight, and the administration will continue to throw away billions and billions of dollars in this conflict if we cannot pass a bill with timelines or restrictions. 
   Clearly, the November midterm elections demonstrated that the majority of the American public is bitterly opposed to the war in Iraq. Just today in fact, a New York Times/CBS poll showed that ``over 61 percent of Americans say that the United States should have stayed out of Iraq, while over 75 percent say that things [in Iraq] are going badly'' (New York Times, May 24, 2007). I stand with the American people today, and although I wholeheartedly support our troops, I cannot support a bill to continue funding a terrible war while the White House refuses to accede to readiness standards or any other measures that restrict their oil war in Iraq. 
   It is estimated that we have already spent over a trillion dollars of taxpayer money in Iraq. This is funding which we could be using for social services for our own citizens. Indeed, important items like education, prescription drugs, health care and homeland security goes underfunded while a disastrous war, unwillingly being paid for by U.S. taxpayers, wages on. 
   And yet the administration continues to request blank checks to be used at their discretion. A perfect example of this is the money sent over there in the period, between May 2003 and June 2004, when our military was carrying huge, wrapped stacks of $100 bills over to Iraq--$12 billion total--in cash. This money was sent over there without oversight, without any sort of accountability, and many are now worried that the same insurgent groups that are battling against our troops may have bought their weapons with this money. And the argument put forward by the  Bush administration for sending money over in this way was that Iraq was without a functioning banking system. This utterly ludicrous reasoning is nearly as preposterous as their lies and poor reasons for going to war in the first place, like scaring the American people into believing that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which, to this day, have not been discovered. 
   President Bush has asked for a blank check and the American people have stamped his account ``insufficient funds.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your leadership on the committee and your leadership for these veterans in this country. And to the ranking member, I know that he did not mean that the leadership of this House, that have devoted a block of time to talk about the veterans and their service to this country, is filling the time. 
   I want to thank the leadership, I want to thank the chairman, and I want to thank the Republicans on the committee because we have some issues that we want to talk about honoring veterans that have served this country. So I know he did not mean that talking about veterans, other than Memorial Day or Veterans Day, is filling our time. He didn't mean that, I know that. 
   So I want to rise in support of veterans-related bills being considered today, and I support all eight of them. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of House Resolution 1231, supporting Vietnam Veterans Day. In my State of Florida, we have close to 600,000 thousand veterans in Florida, and I am pleased to be given the chance to serve their interests as a member for 16 years on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. 
   The Vietnam War was a very divisive time in our Nation's history, and I hope that all Americans, through this resolution, will be able to continue to help heal this Nation, and that the Vietnam vets, who so bravely served our country, will finally get the respect they have earned. Let me just say: Vietnam veterans bravely served this country finally get the respect they helped earn. 
   I am also pleased recently to visit Puerto Rico recently and tour the VA Medical Center in San Juan. I was very impressed with the people who work at that facility and with the people in the territory as a whole. The employees were very professional, and it is a credit to both Puerto Rico and to the VA. 
   I was also in Ponce, admiring the port there, in my other role as a member on the Transportation Committee, and was very impressed by the city and very pleased that the veterans there have access to the VA clinic. 
   I support H.R. 4289, to name the VA clinic in Ponce after Captain Rubio, who earned the Medal of Honor for his service protecting his comrades above and beyond the call of duty. 
   I also rise in support of H.R. 4918, to rename the Miami Veterans Medical Center after one of Florida's bravest servicemen, Private Bruce Wayne Carter, of the United States Marine Corps. His mother still lives in Jacksonville. Private First Class Carter was ordered to Vietnam in April, 1969, and served as a radio operator. When he was 19, and in an act of incredible altruism, he threw himself on an enemy grenade, absorbing the full extent of the blast to protect his fellow marines. 
   He gave his life in service to our country and to his fellow marines and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I am pleased to join the entire Florida delegation in support of this legislation in honor of Bruce Carter. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman, and I urge all of my colleagues to support all eight bills honoring veterans  on the floor of the House of Representatives today. And once again I want to thank the leadership for bringing these veterans bills up today.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. First of all, let me just thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on Transportation. Truly, Mr. Oberstar is a transportation guru. And his motto, ``Transportation is the committee that put America to work,'' I want to thank you for ``let's put America to work safely.'' I also want to thank Mr. Mica and Mr. Shuster for their hard work on this legislation. 
   Developing this rail safety legislation was the number one priority for the Railroad Subcommittee. Congress last passed legislation to reauthorize the Federal Railroad Administration in 1994. That authorization expired in 1998. Since that time, the railroad industry has changed greatly. Economic growth and increase in international trade has led to record traffic levels. At the same time, Amtrak and the commuter railroads, which often operate freight rail lines, are moving more passengers, which means that there's lots of pressure on the rail system, and this has a major impact on work and public safety. 
   Since the beginning of the 110th Congress, the subcommittee has held six hearings on rail safety, examined fatigue, the role of human factors in rail accidents, and the reauthorization of the Federal Rail Safety program. We also held two hearings in Texas and California. 
   In addition to the subcommittee's hearings, we met with labor, the railroads, government agencies, and other interested parties in crafting this legislation. Through some tough negotiations, we were able to develop a bipartisan agreement on the most difficult issues, and I believe we have a really good bill. Let me highlight a number of provisions in the bill. 
   H.R. 2095 reauthorized the FRA as the Federal Railroad Safety Administration and ensures that it will consider and assign maintenance and safety as their highest priority. 
   The bill seeks to help prevent accidents caused by human factors, which accounts for about 40 percent of all rail accidents, by strengthening the hours  of service law, increasing worker training and qualifications, and implementing advanced safety technologies. 
   This bill improves safety at our Nation's grade crossings. It requires railroads to establish, maintain, and post a toll-free number at all grade crossings to receive calls regarding malfunctions of signals, crossing gates, or disabled vehicles blocking crossings. 
   H.R. 2095 directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations regarding railroads to remove all overgrown vegetation from their right-of-way to improve the view of pedestrians and motor vehicle operators. H.R. 2095 also requires railroads to develop and submit to the Secretary a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2014. 
   Further, it requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a long-term strategy for improving railroad safety, which must include a plan and schedule for reducing the number and rates of accidents, injuries and fatalities involving railroads. 
   Simply put, this legislation is going to save lives. I look forward to going to conference and putting a bill on the President's desk for his signature. 
   I want to again thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on the committee. And I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

   The Managers amendment clarifies two important issues that have been dealt with in other legislation. The whistleblower protections and changes to federal preemption which the committee worked hard to fix. 
   It also includes language that requires railroad owners to adopt measures that improve the safety of railroad bridges, and requires the Secretary to consider community concerns when granting exemptions for sounding locomotive whistles. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the congresswoman for introducing this amendment. She's a great addition to the Transportation Committee, but she has come with strong support for railroad safety, and I want to thank her. 
   This is a perfect addition to this safety legislation. This amendment prohibits Mexican companies and inspectors from performing mechanical and brake inspections unless they follow U.S. safety, training and enforcement standards. It makes no sense to apply rail safety measures in the U.S. if they are not going to apply to trains coming in from Mexico. This is just a commonsense amendment.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment Congressman Pallone for his hard work on this issue of rail-owned waste transfer facilities. 
   Yesterday, the Railroad Subcommittee held a hearing on rail-owned municipal waste transfer facilities. We learned that there is a growing concern in the Northeast that some railroads are using Federal preemptions standards to shield themselves from important State and local environmental laws which are leading to a lack of environmental and health-related oversight of these facilities. 
   This language may need to be refined to ensure that States and localities don't overregulate the industry, but this is the right first step in ensuring that railroad operated waste transfer stations are not posing a health or environmental risk to the communities where they're operating. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I think we will work as we go toward conference to improve it and refine the language.

   And I was very excited last weekend that I was in your district, and I was able to ride the train from Union Station to downtown New York. That distance, I was able to do it in 2 1/2 hours, and the goal of our Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is to be able to do it in less time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. That is right. And we want to do it in 2 hours. 
   But the key is we were able to do that, and I was able to take that train ride and read and contemplate what we've got to do. We've passed the Amtrak bill. We've got to move this country forward, and I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue.  
   We've had our heads in the sand long enough on the issues of global warming, and I'm glad that the House Leadership is making this issue a top priority. You only need to look at the constantly rising gas prices to understand why we need to focus on energy independence. 
   My home State of Florida is particularly vulnerable to weather pattern changes brought about by climate change. Florida on average sits just 98 feet above sea level and each year battles hurricanes with increased frequency and intensity. 
   Fortunately, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is taking the bull by the horns and looking at ways that we can decrease the negative effect our transportation system has on the world's ecosystem. 
   One simple way to do this is increasing the use of passenger and freight rail. Freight railroads have made major gains in fuel efficiency through training and improved locomotive technology. A single intermodal 
   train can take up to 280 trucks off our highways. Today, one gallon of diesel fuel can move a ton of freight an average of 414 miles, a 76 percent improvement since 1980. And General Electric will soon unveil the world's first hybrid locomotive. 
   Passenger rails' ability to reduce congestion is well known, with ridership numbers increasing steadily each year. One full passenger train can take 250-350 cars off the roads. Passenger rail also consumes less energy than automobiles and commercial airlines. But we need to get people to wake up and start making passenger rail a priority in this country. 
   Unfortunately, this also brings up the bigger issue of capacity and what we are able to accomplish with the limited rail capacity that currently exists in the United States. We need to find a dedicated source for increasing rail capacity and we need to do it now to prepare for the future. 
   This may not be an easy task, but it is the right thing to do for future generations.

   I want to thank the Gentlelady from the District of Columbia, Ms. Norton, Chairman Conyers, and the Gentleman from Virginia Mr. Davis for working very hard to bring the vote to the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   I rise today in support of this legislation. 
   This country's history is replete with certain groups being denied the right to vote. 
   Being from Florida, I understand about disenfranchisement. It is something I fight against and oppose every day. Disenfranchisement did not end with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, and it will not end when the residents of the District of Columbia finally get the right to vote. It is a continual fight, needing eternal vigilance to protect. 
   This bill will go a long way in righting the wrongs that have been perpetuated on the American people for too long.  
   This bill ends the 206-year-old injustice of ``taxation without representation'' for over a half a million District residents. Residents of the District of Columbia serve in the military, pay billions of dollars in Federal taxes each year, serve on juries, and assume other responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. And yet, for over 200 years, they have been denied full voting representation in the Congress. The United States is the only democracy in the world that deprives the residents of its capital city full voting representation in the national legislature. Essentially, residents of every State have a vote regarding the laws that govern the District, while those living in the District itself do not. 
   Support the right to vote. Support voting rights for the residents of the District of Columbia. Support H.R. 1905.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Nation's workers. The workers who built this country following depression and war. I rise in support of this loan program for our Nation's automobile manufacturers. 
   Just last Friday the Department of Labor reported that employers slashed 533,000 jobs in November: the most jobs lost in 34 years. As a percentage, this figure now jettisoned our Nation's unemployment rate to 6.7 percent; the largest one-month decline since December 1974. Overall, since the start of the current recession, the United States has shed 1.9 million jobs, 1.3 million of which has disappeared in the last 4 months. In the manufacturing sector, manufacturing jobs lost in November alone come to a total of 85,000. In fact, in the last 4 months we have witnessed the disappearance of 258,000 manufacturing jobs, and since the outset of the recession last December, over half a million (604,000) manufacturing jobs have been lost. 
   So with regard to the question of whether or not to assist our Nation's domestic auto manufactures, given that the Big Three automakers generate one out of every 10 jobs in our Nation, merely letting these businesses go bankrupt is simply not an acceptable option. Indeed, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler account for roughly 70 percent of U.S. auto production and are estimated to support around 5 million jobs across all 50 states. And according to a report released last week by the Center for Automotive Research, the failure of even one U.S. automaker would mean the loss of millions of jobs and cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   Employment for millions of hard working Americans depends on a strong domestic auto industry. And nations throughout the world, such as Japan, South Korea, and France support their domestic auto industries, so we certainly would not be creating a precedent or an unfair playing field with respect to international trade. Indeed, President-elect Obama stated just last week that ``the auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing and a critical part of our attempt to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.......'' Given that our government recently provided a tremendous amount of financial assistance ($700 billion) to sustain our country's financial sector, I believe that to provide assistance with strong federal oversight to our Nation's automakers is critical to our workforce.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to bring an amendment to H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007. This bill establishes a toll-free hotline for reporting deficiencies in medical facilities and a new system of case managers, advocates and counselors for wounded servicemen returning from combat overseas to help them get the  care they need and help navigate the military health care system. 
   The bill provides no professional protections for servicemen if they or their family members call this hotline to get better treatment. This could cause those injured men and women to refrain from reporting abuses and problems, and the situation we currently have at Walter Reed could continue. 
   There is also the worry that anything reported will affect the serviceman's career. My amendment would simply offer confidentiality for those soldiers to get the care they are provided under this bill. 
   This amendment requires any hotline set up by the Secretary of Defense to ask if the caller wants confidentiality at the beginning of the phone call. 
   Last month, I was in the grocery store in Jacksonville, Florida. A veteran working part time told me about a friend at Walter Reed, with pictures showing the problems occurring there. I couldn't believe what he was describing to me was a military facility, and I told him, You can't believe everything you see on the Internet. The next day, the very next day, this story was in The Washington Post. The fact that an active duty soldier was treated this way is inconceivable. 
   Most of the information I get is from families, about the war and lack of equipment. Not from the Department of Defense, not from the soldiers, but from the family members. I do not want a call for help by a wounded serviceman or woman or their family to be used against them. I do not want those heroes to be scared to ask for help, to be scared their future career could be compromised by one phone call. 
   Support the Brown amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (POISON CENTER SUPPORT, ENHANCEMENT, AND AWARENESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5669. The Poison control centers provide vital healthcare services to Americans of all incomes and keep costs from emergency procedures under control. Through their cost-saving programs, these centers benefit the general public, the government, health care providers, public health entities, and insurers. 
   In my district, Jay Schauben supervises a poison control center at Shans-Jacksonville hospital that treats a population of approximately six million. The Florida legislature created this center in 1989 to address overwhelming needs in the areas of exposure treatment and education, and Dr. Schauben's team has risen to the challenge and helped a countless number of my constituents. I would also like to thank Senator David Karnes, whose tireless support has been a great help in attaining funding for these important centers. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Gerold Schiebler of the University of Florida. Dr. Schiebler has been active for decades in the campaign for affordable healthcare and widespread access to poison control services. 
   With our economy in recession, now is certainly no time to further limit access to the quality healthcare services, or to tie the hands of advocates like Dr. Schauben, Senator Karnes, and Dr. Schiebler. So, it is critically important that poison control centers are reauthorized, and that these centers receive full funding through Fiscal Year 2014. 
   A wide variety of Americans benefit from the services poison control centers provide every day. The general public benefits by receiving cost-free poisoning prevention guidelines, emergency medical advice, and follow-up calls about treatment. These services prevent trips to emergency rooms and keep already outrageous healthcare costs from rising even further. 
   I represent one of the poorest districts in the State of Florida, and I have seen first hand the challenges my constituents face in finding affordable healthcare. A study group consisting of medical and poison control experts has found that every dollar spent on poison centers saves seven dollars in healthcare costs. 
   Also, poison control centers provide educational programs aimed at prevention. These programs help educate many uninsured Americans about means of poison prevention, and keep healthcare costs in the U.S. down by avoiding emergency room procedures. 
   In addition to saving low- and middle-income Americans healthcare dollars, poison control centers provide 24-hour emergency and informational services via a Toll-Free National Hotline. This hotline is a vital source of information for many of my constituents, and Americans across the country, who could not otherwise receive medical advice or attention. This hotline also provides essential follow-up calls regarding continuing care of poison exposures. 
   Without a national hotline, many individuals with known or suspected toxic exposures would seek significantly more costly and less accessible healthcare alternatives, such as an emergency room visit. 
   Simply, the benefits of these centers are widespread, but are especially helpful to those whose incomes prohibit access to private health care services. Failure to reauthorize these important centers would represent a tremendous disservice to Americans in all Congressional districts. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5669.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   This amendment would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the number of tourists who have visited an urban area in the 2 years preceding the year the Secretary awards Urban Area Security Initiative Grants. 
   Urban Area Security Initiative Grants are designed to fund activities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist attacks and catastrophic events in designated high-threat, high-risk urban areas.     
   The Department of Homeland Security uses a number of factors to allocate funds and assess risks, including special events, theme parks and population. However, a critical element is missing from their list of factors. Homeland Security has yet to explicitly account for tourists as a risk factor when allocating Urban Area Security Initiative Grants. 
   A recent Congressional Research Service report says due to the potential for mass casualty incidents and economic damage from terrorist attacks, tourist locations are at risk. In addition to the location of tourist destinations, the tourist population could possibly be at risk, too. 
   Heavy tourist areas present a twofold incentive for terrorists: a high probability of a sizeable number of casualties and damage to the economy. A 2005 study by the Rand Corporation found that terrorists have an increased concentration on civilian targets and an ongoing emphasis on economic attacks. 
   Most experts agree the evidence shows that terrorists are seeking to kill as many people as possible. The high number of tourists who are staying at any given time in tourist magnets such as Orlando or Miami significantly increases the potential consequence of an attack in those cities. Congress cannot let terrorists exploit this gap in our grant funding. 
   In addition, the economic danger resulting from a terrorist attack on a tourist location is another incentive. Terrorist attacks depress consumer confidence and spending that hurts businesses, undermines investment and our overall economic condition. Congress must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security considers this incentive for terrorists when distributing Urban Area Security Initiative Grants. 
   In past years, concerns were raised that the Department did not adequately account for the large tourist population in cities such as Las Vegas, Orlando and San Diego when they calculated the risk for our Nation's urban areas. In fact, in fiscal year 2006, Las Vegas and San Diego were left off the list of the top 35 cities that were eligible to receive grants under the UASI program. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has been very secretive regarding how Urban Area Security Initiative Grants are allocated. A recent General Accountability Office report stated, ``DHS has not provided us documentation on what analyses were conducted, how they were conducted, how they were used and how they affected the final risk assessment scores and relative rankings.'' 
   The Department of Homeland Security has made claims that they consider tourist populations, but the problem is Homeland Security has not been specific regarding risk assessment methods or providing Congress adequate information to prove that they have done so. Although the Department of Homeland Security made administrative changes to the fiscal year 2007 grant process to account for tourist populations, my amendment would clearly codify this change. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. 
   As chair of the Rail Subcommittee, we have done initial studies, and we have found that we are celebrating the anniversary of the bombing in Madrid, the bombing in London, the bombing in India, and yet the administration has not come forward with recommendations as to how to secure our rail system, how to implement a program to safeguard that we do not have this kind of attack on homeland security here in the United States. 
   So I strongly support the amendment  
   March 11th marked the third anniversary of the train bombings in Madrid, and we have seen terrorist attacks in London and India in each year since. Yet the Bush Administration and past Republican leadership has done little to protect our Nation's freight rail or the millions of passengers that use public transportation every day. 
   The anniversary of this terrible tragedy again raises the serious question of whether we are prepared in this country for a similar attack. Sadly, that answer is a resounding NO. But with the passage of this legislation, we will start investing the money that is needed to safeguard our rail and transit infrastructure from those who wish us harm. 
   The Federal Government has focused most of its attention on enhancing security in the airline industry and has largely ignored the needs of public transit agencies and railroads. Yet, worldwide, more terrorist attacks have occurred on transit and rail systems since 9/11 than on airlines. 
   In 2006, we dedicated $4.7 billion to the airline industry for security, while 6,000 public transit agencies and one national passenger railroad, Amtrak, had to share a meager $136 million total for security upgrades. Nothing was provided to the 532 freight railroads for security upgrades. 
   Fortunately for the traveling public, the legislation on the floor today will address the security challenges facing our Nation's transit and rail systems. 
   This bill requires comprehensive security plans; strengthens whistleblower protections for workers; mandates security training; improves communication and intelligence sharing; authorizes a higher-level of grant funding for Amtrak, the freight railroads, and public transportation providers; and provides funding for life-safety improvements to the tunnels in New York, Boston, and Washington, DC. 
   Most importantly, it helps make sure our communities, our First Responders, and our transit and rail workers are safe and secure. And it does all of this through a coordinated effort between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation, the agency that has the expertise to deal with transportation safety issues. 
   We are way behind many other countries in protecting our transit and rail systems, but with the new leadership in Congress and this comprehensive legislation, we have a plan that will protect millions of transit and rail passengers and the communities through which freight railroads operate from harm, while keeping the trains running on time. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to do the right thing for your constituents and support this long overdue rail and transit security legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, last August I held six (6) Town Hall Meetings throughout my district on the new Medicare Part D Prescription Drug program, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. Not only did it give my constituents a chance to get help and get their questions answered, it gave me an opportunity to really find out how the new program is working. 
   I've been an elected official for 25 years, and I have never seen a program that penalizes somebody for the rest of their life if they didn't sign up right away. 
   This current Medicare Part D bill was written by and for the Insurance and Pharmaceutical industry without the needs of our seniors in mind. 
   This bill allows the private drug plans to take drugs off their approved list, and even charge more for drugs throughout the year, while seniors are locked in and cannot change plans until the next year. 
   Incredibly, the Republican Leadership wrote a bill that specifically prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating the price of drugs. Even though both the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of DoD are negotiating their drug prices right now. 
   Could you imagine if we told Wal-Mart that they couldn't get a reduced price by buying in bulk? Every member of the Republican Party would be on this floor screaming bloody murder, but when it's needed drugs for our senior citizens, there is deafening silence. 
   This is another perfect example of the Republicans talking out of both sides of their mouth. They stand on the floor every day demanding that we save the taxpayers money, but when we try to do that with the companies that fill their campaign coffers, they say we are hurting business. But the real truth is that the drug companies are making record profits while seniors and taxpayers are paying higher drug prices. 
   And one of the most troubling aspects of this bill and one that most people don't know about is the ``donuthole'' where no coverage is provided after you spend $2,250 until your costs reach $5,100. That's $3000 in out of pocket costs that few if any of our seniors can afford. 
   I encourage my colleagues to do the right thing for our parents and grandparents and allow the secretary to negotiate bulk prices for these needed drugs.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this legislation, H.R. 2956. 
   I have to remind my colleagues that I am from Florida and it does matter who is the President, and we should never forget the 2000 election because it matters who is the President of the United States. 
   President Bush intentionally misled the American people by supplying false grounds for going to war, and I personally never supported the war in Iraq. 
   This war has cost over a half trillion dollars. This war is now costing over $12 billion per month. 
   I stand with the American people and I wholeheartedly support our troops; yet I cannot support a truly senseless war that has killed 3,600 Americans and left over 26,000 severely wounded. 
   The soldiers did not vote for this war, but when given a mission, they do the best they can to complete it. The military is doing the job they were sent to do. There was a flaw in the mission from the beginning, and the flaw lies with us. 
   I want to be clear. The President's checking account has been overdrawn. The Bush administration's manipulation of taxpayer dollars to fund this war is over, and 70 percent of the American people oppose this war. This war needs to come to an immediate end. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill. Let's redeploy our men and women.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, first of all I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on this issue of transportation. He is truly the guru of transportation, and the country appreciates his leadership. And thanks to Ranking Members Mica and Shuster. I guess the pledge of serving in Congress is serving on transportation, because transportation is truly bipartisan. 
   This is truly a monumental day for America, and I am so pleased to be a part of it. If you are worrying about energy prices and the economy, this bill is a one-two punch. Passenger and freight rail are energy efficient, providing good jobs that can't be shipped overseas and transporting thousands of people and tons of cargo each day in a safe and efficient manner, and all of this without drilling off the coast. 
   Let me repeat. If you are worried about $4 and $5 gas prices, passenger and freight rail are energy efficient, provide good jobs that can't be shipped overseas and transport thousands of people and tons of cargo each day in a safe and efficient manner. 
   Rising gas prices alone, with increased highway and airport congestion, have made intercity passenger rail more popular and necessary than ever. In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight fiscal year of record ridership. Like its ridership gains, Amtrak's fiscal performance has improved as well, posting approximately $1.5 billion in ticket sales. 
   More than just a convenient way to travel, Amtrak is a greener mode of transportation. One full passenger train can take between 250 to 350 cars off the road. Rail travel is more energy efficient and uses less fuel than cars or airplanes. According to the U.S. Department of Energy data, Amtrak is 17 percent more efficient than domestic air travel and 21 percent more efficient than auto travel. 
   Unfortunately, for many years Amtrak has been given just enough money each year to limp along, never getting the necessary funds to make serious improvements in the system. The high voltage electric system is over 70 years old, 65 percent of the bridges were built in the 1920s, and several tunnels that the trains go through every year were built in the 1800s. 
   In 2005, Amtrak conducted a comprehensive review of its capital needs. The review determined that Amtrak should invest $4.2 billion to bring their infrastructure to a state of good repair. Today, with the backlog of major bridges and tunnel work, the necessary investment capital has approached an estimated $6 billion. 
   As other countries continue to invest tens of billions of dollars each year in improving their passenger rail systems, we are falling further and further behind by deferring these much-needed improvements to our system. We must find a way to speed up Amtrak's backlog of repair work and bring its assets to a state of good repair. Then Amtrak can concentrate on increasing capacity, increasing speed, developing new facilities and planning for the future. These major infrastructure improvements are also necessary to improve the safety and security of the system and its passengers and workers. 
   Amtrak has and will continue to play a critical role in evacuating and transporting citizens during national emergencies. Amtrak was the only mode of transportation out of New York following 9/11, and transported citizens and delivered vital supplies following Hurricane Katrina. Unfortunately, it is also a prime target for those who wish to harm us, and we must provide resources to make the system less vulnerable. 
   This legislation also includes vital railroad safety legislation that will improve the effectiveness of freight rail systems, and, most important, will help save the lives of rail employees and the people living in the communities they serve. 
   Freight railroads are also energy efficient and have made major gains in fuel efficiency through training and improved locomotive technology. A single intermodal train can take up to 280 trucks off of our highways. Today, one gallon of diesel fuel can move a ton of freight an average of 414 miles, a 76 percent improvement since 1980. 
   Since the beginning of the 110th Congress, the Railroad Subcommittee has held five hearings on rail safety, examined fatigue, human factors and rail accidents, and current Federal safety programs. In addition to the subcommittee's hearing, we met with all of our stakeholders, including labor, the railroads, government agencies and other interested parties to craft this legislation. 
   The bill seeks to help prevent accidents caused by human factors, which account for 40 percent of all rail accidents, by strengthening the hours-of-service laws, decreasing limbo time, increasing worker training and qualifications, and implementing advanced safety technology. 
   It requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a long-term strategy for improving railroad safety at railroad crossings by improving visibility and making it easier to report problems.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank Mr. Filner for his leadership on this committee. I am so proud that I am a part of this committee. Under his leadership, we passed the largest VA budget in the history of the United States. Our committee doesn't just ``talk the talk.'' We are ``walking the walk'' for the veterans. Thank you, and thanks to all of the members of the committee. 
   I rise in support of S. 2162, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008. This bill includes many important issues of concern for veterans: mental health care, assistance for families, health care, pain care, provisions helping homeless vets, and construction of badly needed medical facilities. 
   This last item is very important to Florida. My State has the largest and fastest growing elderly veterans population in the country. Everyone enjoys the warm weather, and veterans are no different. It is high time we build the facilities that will take care of those heroes and sheroes. 
   The bill increases the authorization for the construction of a new VA medical facility in Orlando for close to $700 million. We have waited over 25 years for this facility. Let me repeat that. We have waited over 25 years for this facility, and to have construction delayed because of lack of money due to increased energy costs or inflation would be criminal. 
   Also this bill increases the authorization by $51.5 million to fund patient privacy at the Gainesville Medical Center. We need to make sure our veterans are treated with respect. 
   Earlier this year, this Congress passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill under the leadership of Chairman Chet Edwards. I appreciate his including funds for the projects in this bill, allowing for the continued development of these medical centers. 
   I urge the passage of this bill and continued support for our Nation's veterans. 
   May God bless America, and I thank all the veterans for their service.
