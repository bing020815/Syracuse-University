<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us seek a place in this hallowed institution to serve our country and our constituents, to make a difference, to help change the world for the better. Mr. Speaker, today we are given an opportunity to edge ever closer to the accomplishment of these goals. 
   Today we have an opportunity to positively impact the lives of countless human beings worldwide by recommitting ourselves to fighting and eliminating a great threat to our international security, and that is the global AIDS pandemic. 
   The bill before us reauthorizes the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Before this bill was enacted, known as PEPFAR, only 55,000 people living in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving life-saving treatment, but according to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, through PEPFAR, the United States now has supported treatment for 1.68 million people in Africa and 1.73 million people worldwide. 
   Further, the United States has provided prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services for women enduring nearly 12.7 million pregnancies. We have also prevented an estimated 194,000 infant infections. We have supported care for more than 6.6 million people in need, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. We have supported over 33 million counseling and testing sessions to date for men, women, and children. 
   These successes are truly remarkable and serve as a testament that all can be accomplished when Members from the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle work together to find solutions to one of the world's most pressing challenges. 
   The 2008 reauthorization seeks to consolidate and advance the successes of the past 5 years by providing the funding and the framework to transform this from an emergency program to a sustainable program. It stands as a noble legacy of the late Henry J. Hyde and Tom Lantos who spearheaded this mission of mercy 5 years ago, and I am proud that the bill bears their names. 
   The stakes for this initiative, Mr. Speaker, are higher than ever. Despite the best efforts of responsible nations to confront the global AIDS pandemic, there are now over 33 million people around the world living with this disease. An estimated 7,000 new infections occur every day. In its wake, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is leaving a trail of poverty, of despondency, of death, which has destabilized societies and undermined the security of entire regions. 
   Our former House colleague and current ambassador to Tanzania, the Honorable Mark Green, wrote to me highlighting the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the security of our country. And he said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could create a long-term breeding ground for radicalism.'' 
   So it is therefore incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to advance this critical program which not only saves lives and exemplifies the generous humanitarian nature of the American people, but it also helps to preserve our national security. 
   It is important to note that even in the most remote areas of Kenya or Haiti, for example, people know about the PEPFAR program. They know from where the test kits, the medicines, and other life-saving support is coming. They recognize the leadership and the resources that the United States has provided in an effort to fight this deadly disease, and they are deeply appreciative. This is not just a health program. This is a public diplomacy program as well, and it has greatly enhanced global understanding of the true nature and the essence of the American people at a critical time in our Nation's history. We have led by example, and our success has been measured in human lives saved. 
   Now, the House has debated and adopted this bill by an overwhelming margin in April of this year. This House text was the product of a bipartisan compromise that preserved the spirit of the 2003 Act while balancing a number of congressional imperatives. Just as in the House, our Senate colleagues sought to produce legislation that would capitalize and expand upon the success of the energy plan while maintaining the bipartisan political consensus that has guided this program from its inception. 
   After 3 months of negotiations, the amendment before us was approved in the Senate by a margin of 80-16, demonstrating the strong bipartisan commitment of the Senate of their own carefully constructed compromise. 
   The Senate amendment contains numerous modifications to the text approved by the House in April. It reduces the authorization of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs from $50 billion to $48 billion. It allows for a gradual increase of resources over time rather than authorizing $10 billion for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2013. It requires more than half of all funding appropriated for bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for treatment and care. It replaces the hard target for treatment with a sliding scale whereby the treatment target will increase over $3 million in direct proportion to increased appropriations. And further, it authorizes the use of compacts as further vehicles for HIV/AIDS assistance in an effort to promote sustainability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment preserves and strengthens other critical provisions that were at the heart of the House compromise overwhelmingly adopted in April. For example, it corrects an unintended omission by including care under the conscience clause which allows faith-based organizations to disassociate themselves from any program or activity to which they have a religious or moral objection. Also, it amends the abstinence and fidelity language contained in section 403 by striking behavior change programs including abstinence and fidelity, and inserting activities promoting  abstinence and fidelity. This modification provides clarity to the compromise reached in the House last spring. 
   The Senate amendment also includes two provisions that have raised some concern, including the establishment of a $2 billion emergency plan for Indian safety and health, and the lifting of certain restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
   The first provision, the Indian Safety and Health title of the Senate amendment initially raised concerns about mandatory spending and unfunded mandates. However, the Congressional Budget Office has verified that the language in question is an authorization and does not have implications for direct spending. 
   It also bears mentioning that the health programs will be implemented through the Indian Health Service which is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   With respect to the second item, Mr. Speaker, lifting the ban is largely symbolic because the authority to waive the restriction already exists and is routinely exercised, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, an alien with HIV would still be inadmissible under current HHS recommendations on communicable diseases of public health significance, and this would continue to be the case until and unless the regulations are changed. The Senate amendment includes offsets for the estimated additional costs involved with the processing of these new visas. 
   Throughout this process, Members on both sides of the aisle have been forced to make difficult choices to arrive at a consensus that carefully balances U.S. priorities and the range of congressional concerns. The challenges have been great and at times have seemed insurmountable. But a failure to act now would imperil our ability to provide life-saving support to millions of people in need around the world and will ultimately undermine what is arguably the most successful United States foreign assistance and public diplomacy program today. 
   We have been given a unique opportunity to help make the world a better place for those who have been victimized by the AIDS pandemic while simultaneously enhancing our own Nation's security. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Senate amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 so that this bill can be signed by the President without further delay and we can get to work on saving even more lives. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I believe that PEPFAR is the most successful example of American foreign assistance since the Marshall Plan. Just as the Marshall Plan protected American lives by helping to stabilize a continent ravaged by war, PEPFAR is protecting American lives today by helping to stabilize a continent ravaged by disease.     
   More than just express American compassion, PEPFAR also protects American security. Let us give our strong support to H.R. 5501. 
   In closing, I would like to thank the following staff members of our Foreign Affairs Committee who have dedicated many long hours to ensuring that this bill is signed into law and we can continue U.S. efforts to save lives. For the  majority, Dr. Bob King, Peter Yeo, Dr. Pearl Alice Marsh, David Abramowitz and Kristin Wells. On our side, the Republican side, Joan Condon, Mark Gage, Doug Anderson, Sarah Kiko, Sam Stratman, Sheri Rickert, and our fabulous GOP staff director, Dr. Yleem Poblete. Thank you so much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that our colleagues will see the meritorious nature of this proposal, because the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a significant threat to global health. It's also a leading threat to global stability. We can help fill this void. We can help stabilize the continent. We can help save lives by passing this bill today and sending it to the President's desk. As soon as tomorrow, we can have it on the President's desk and have a bill signed by next week. 
   We are in a position where we can make a difference, because this virus is killing millions of people in the prime of life. These are parents. These are teachers. These are government officials, public health workers and military officers, people who hold the fabric of life together for their community. We have an opportunity to rise to the challenge, pass this bill and save their lives and save a generation of lives around the world. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to extend my congratulations to a dear constituent of my congressional district, Luis Diaz, upon his upcoming retirement as deputy director of Youth Co-Op. 
   He has dedicated his life to the betterment of the youth of South Florida by ensuring that they learn the necessary skills to be able to compete and to be productive members of today's society. 
   For more than three decades, Youth Co-Op has been a pioneer in assisting refugee children and young people in making the transition, sometimes difficult, into their new communities. Mr. Diaz' leadership and his dedication have been instrumental in helping maintain the vision of Youth Co-Op. 
   He is also a distinguished journalist, producer and talk show host. 
   He has been involved with the Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Council as well as with the Spanish American League against Discrimination, among many other civic organizations. 
   Luis Diaz' proudest role, however, Madam Speaker, is that of a husband and that of a father. His love and devotion to his wife, Xiomara, and to his three children mirror his commitment to our community. 
   I am proud to not only call Luis Diaz a South Floridian but also my friend, all of South Florida's friend. Happy retirement, Mr. Diaz.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today we rise to celebrate the 85th anniversary of the founding of an organization truly worthy of the praise of this body and of our Nation. 
   The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA, was founded to embrace ideals which are prized by the United States and Greece both individually and jointly. The Greek American community seeks to embody the principles of AHEPA's mission, most notably: freedom from bigotry and discrimination, philanthropy, education, civic responsibility, and family and individual excellence through community service. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that the Greek-American community is represented by an organization of the caliber and effectiveness of AHEPA. 
   AHEPA has done much over the years to strengthen and support our Nation domestically and to further our interests internationally--from providing dignified affordable senior housing at home, to encouraging a more stable Eastern Mediterranean and a stronger EU. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in strong support of this resolution commemorating the 85th anniversary of the founding of AHEPA and recognizing the significant contributions of Greek-Americans to the United States.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 557, introduced by my friend Congressman JOHN CAMPBELL of California and his Democratic coauthor also from California (Mr. Berman). 
   The activities of the United Nations Human Rights Council during its first year in operation has been a travesty, but it should not come as any surprise to us. 
   Over the summer the council, which embraces serious human rights abusers as members, celebrated its first birthday by giving gifts to repressive dictators and Islamic radicals. It stopped unfinished investigations into human rights conditions in Cuba and Belarus and created a permanent agenda item relating to Israel, the only country singled out for such scrutiny. 
   Darfur, apparently the Human Rights Council sees no problem in southern Sudan.     
   North Korea, no evil there. China, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, there are no human rights abusers in that workers' paradise. The bloody repression in Burma, in Zimbabwe, the council members have never heard of these actions. Unfortunately, these are exactly the consequences that many of us expected given the flaws inherent in the council's creation. For example, there are no criteria for membership in the council. Certain regional groups also are given greater power than democratic countries. And special sessions are easier to call, with Israel being the target for condemnation. 
   The council's structure and agenda are hopelessly compromised by political manipulation. The only country, again, singled out for actual condemnation has been the democratic State of Israel, which was the subject of three special sessions and 75 percent of all council resolutions and decisions expressing concerns about human rights conditions. 
   In June, because of such outrages, the House adopted an amendment that I proposed to the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill which prohibited United States funding for the council. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Berman's resolution before us today presents this body with another important opportunity to protest the farce, the insult, the travesty, the sad joke that the U.N. Human Rights Council has become. 
   I urge unanimous support for its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (GLOBAL POVERTY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the gentleman's bill, H.R. 1302, the Global Poverty Act of 2007. We certainly have serious needs and poverty right here in our own country. The suffering of the world's extremely poor, however, is beyond the imagining of most Americans. 
   Many Americans might be shocked to know just how many men, women and children around the world die each hour of every day simply because they are too poor to obtain food, shelter or basic medical care. While we quite often see the fatal impact of famines or natural disasters, we rarely see the images of the ongoing suffering caused by persistent hunger and chronic poverty. 
   The bill seeks to better organize the approaches to fighting poverty that are employed by the Agency for International Development and other agencies in our own government. It would seek to accomplish that by calling on the President to create an overall strategy for these efforts. 
   I note that the sponsor of the bill, my good friend, Mr. Smith from Washington, agreed to an amendment adopted by our Foreign Affairs Committee that made two important changes. First, while referencing foreign aid and debt relief as components of a strategy to address global poverty, the bill now makes it clear that the strategy that the President would draw up would not have to be based on the assumption that the United States foreign aid and debt relief will always continue to rise. 
   The United States certainly has been generous in its provisions of foreign aid and debt relief. But no one can predict whether those two types of assistance will always rise. 
   Moreover, to address poverty comprehensively, the President may want to focus on expanding other types of interactions with countries suffering from widespread poverty, such as promoting trade, promoting investment, for example. 
   The bill, in the amended text before us today, Mr. Speaker, will allow the greater flexibility in deciding what might work best at a given time, in the particular circumstances, rather than insisting that he devise a strategy that assumes that more foreign aid and debt relief are always required. 
   Secondly, the bill, as amended, requires that the President submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the strategy once every 2 years, rather than once a year, as originally intended. And I appreciate the sponsor of the bill agreeing to that change. The change in the frequency of the reports, of the submission of the reports, Mr. Speaker, will enhance the substance of the periodic reports as significant statements on the progress being made under a global poverty reduction strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that Mr. Smith's bill will promote a greater focus on how we might best provide assistance to those in dire poverty overseas, while ensuring a realistic view of the resources and the means available to us to provide such assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (OPPOSING ASSASSINATION OF LEBANESE PUBLIC FIGURES -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 548. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York, my good friend, Mr. Ackerman, for introducing this important resolution, and for Chairman Lantos of our Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing it before the floor today. 
   With the execution last Wednesday of an anti-Syrian Lebanese parliamentarian in a Christian suburb of Beirut, and the announcement today that the Lebanese Parliament will delay until next month the election of a new Lebanese president due to a Hezbollah-led opposition boycott, both Syria and Iran are now one step closer to their strategic goal of once again dominating Lebanon. 
   Four anti-Syrian parliamentarians are all that stand in the way of the detestable efforts of pro-Syrian forces within Lebanon to impose their presidential candidate on all of Lebanon and deny Lebanon its true sovereignty. They will undoubtedly use the time afforded by the delay in the presidential election to effectively finish the job they started in the wake of the coalition's March 14 electoral victory. 
   And what is the goal of these pro-Syrian forces? To gain a parliamentary majority through assassination and terror. Led by Hezbollah, the pro-Syrian parliamentary bloc has repeatedly demanded that a compromise candidate who will bring national unity be elected to the presidency next month. However, Mr. Speaker, just the opposite is true. A compromise and a unity candidate can only serve to bring about the election of yet another Syrian and Iranian puppet to the presidency. Like the outgoing so-called president, such a leader will work to prevent Lebanon from extricating itself from Iranian and Syrian influence and total control. 
   Furthermore, the inclusion of pro-Syrian and Iranian elements in the Lebanese Government renders the government, regardless of the individual desires of the members, and indeed the entire electoral process, an effective tool of Syria and Iran. Some had hoped that Hezbollah's entry into Lebanese politics would signal its integration into Lebanese society and force its leaders to dismantle Hezbollah's military and terrorist infrastructure. Sadly, the opposite has occurred. Allowing an Islamic terrorist entity to use the political process and legitimatize itself without first demanding that it stop its objectionable behavior only serve to perpetuate and enhance the threat. 
   Last October, Iran and Syria changed their calculations as to how to best use Hezbollah to advance their interests and undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon. They instructed Hezbollah to withdraw from the government. 
   Since then, Hezbollah, joined by other Syrian and Iranian proxies, has worked steadily to overthrow the government by politically paralyzing it in parliament and assassinating its supporters. At the same time, they have reportedly provided massive amounts of arms, training, and financial support to Hezbollah as it rebuilds from the conflict with Israel last summer. 
   Additionally, reports that the Lebanese Army has enabled Hezbollah to reassert its control over southern Lebanon continues to gravely concern us. 
   Mr. Speaker, simply put, we cannot afford to continue to pursue a policy toward Lebanon based on willful negligence. We must accept that a moderate government will only materialize after the Syrian and Iranian proxies in Lebanon are defeated and dismantled. This resolution represents a step in the correct direction by voicing its unequivocal support for a true democratic government, and all those within Lebanon who have struggled against Syrian and Iranian control over their homeland for far too long truly deserve our support. I strongly urge my colleagues to support Mr. Ackerman's resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Hurricanes Felix, Dean, and Henriette delivered a devastating toll to the countries of Mexico, the rest of Central America, and the Caribbean. Between the three hurricanes, nearly 200 lives were lost, hundreds of thousands of people were displaced, and thousands of homes were destroyed. 
   I join my colleagues today to express our sincere sympathy and support for the people who have suffered as a result of these destructive storms. The resiliency of the people of these nations to overcome the tremendous power of these catastrophes has been truly tested. When Hurricane Felix hit on September 4, Honduras and Nicaragua were still in the midst of rebuilding following the effects of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Especially vulnerable to natural disasters due to their dependence on agricultural exports and the potential for damaging mudslides, the historic occurrence of two category 5 storms in 1 year had an overwhelming impact for several of the countries in this region. 
   I commend the courage that our neighbors in Mexico, the rest of Central America, and the Caribbean continue to demonstrate in their efforts to overcome the damage wrought, and I admire the courage and the contributions made by relief agencies, private citizens, and the international community to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Felix, Hurricane Dean, and Henriette. 
   Our prayers are with the family and friends of those who were harmed by the perils of this terrible storm season. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is a day of contrast. Today as we stand here in this hallowed Chamber of democracy discussing the threat that Iran poses to the United States and, indeed, to global security, to its own people as well, Iran's leader will later be spewing his venomous rhetoric before the United Nations General Assembly. 
   Last year, the leader of the Iranian regime called for Israel to be wiped off the map and for a new wave of Palestinian attacks to destroy the Jewish state. He further stated that anyone who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the fury of Islamic nations. 
   This is not the first time that the Iranian leadership has called for the destruction of Israel. On December 14, 2001, former Iranian leader Rafsanjani threatened Israel with nuclear attack, saying that the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel would destroy that country while it would do little harm to the Islamic world. 
   Given the Iranian regime's history of acting on its declarations, we should be under no illusions regarding its intentions. And its intentions are to get a nuclear weapon. In fact, they are even taking out advertisements about it.  
   Let me show you this very revealing ad that appeared in the May issue of the Economist. As they say, ``a picture is worth a thousand words.'' Even as the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that ``gaps remain in the agency's knowledge with respect to the scope and content of Iran's centrifuge program ..... including the role of the military in Iran's nuclear program .....'' and voiced concern regarding ``undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran,'' and even as additional sanctions were being considered against Iran by the United Nations Security Council, this request for proposals for two new large nuclear plants appeared in a major western magazine. And let me point out that the ad clearly identifies the name of the bank, a European bank. For the record, it is Austria Bank Creditansalt, with the account number clearly evident in the advertisement. 
   Mr. Speaker, for over 5 years, Iran has been manipulating the international community, buying time to expand and to hide its nuclear program, and it is making rapid progress. The International Atomic Energy Agency report of August 30 of this year stated that Iran is running almost 2,000 centrifuges with as many more being tested or under construction, indicating that it has already overcome many of the roadblocks to manufacturing nuclear fuel, including weapons-grade material. 
   The estimate of the International Atomic Energy Agency, however, may be too conservative. Iranian leader Ahmadinejad put the number of centrifuges at 3,000 and said that the program was making great strides. His comments underscored his regime's intense focus on its nuclear weapons program and should increase our focus and our sense of urgency.     
   When thinking of the consequences of an Iranian nuclear bomb, we must always remember that Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism, supplying weapons, funding, training and sanctuary to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas that have murdered countless civilians and threatens our allies in the region and elsewhere; that Iran continues to supply Shiite Islamic groups in Iraq with money, training and weapons that fuel sectarian violence; that Iran is responsible for the deaths of U.S. troops by providing the resources and the materials used for improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and other much more powerful weapons; that Iran is also supplying the Taliban with weapons to use against our troops serving in Afghanistan. 
   My daughter-in-law is proudly wearing our Nation's uniform right now in Afghanistan, and Iran's work is a danger to her and all of our sons and daughters serving overseas. 
   However, Tehran's pursuit of these destructive policies has one weakness, namely, its dependence on the revenue derived from energy exports. For that reason, the U.S. has targeted Iran's energy sector, attempting to starve it of its foreign investment. U.S. law prohibits American firms from investing in Iran, but foreign entities continue to do so. To address that problem, my distinguished colleague, my good friend from California, the chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos, and I introduced the Iran Freedom Support Act, which was enacted into law in September of last year. 
   This legislation under consideration today, however, H.R. 1400, builds upon that foundation, reiterates the application of the Iran Sanctions Act, ISA, to parent companies of foreign subsidiaries that engage in activities that ISA would prohibit for U.S. entities. Like its predecessors, the Iraq Freedom Support Act and H.R. 957, this bill before us, H.R. 1400, expands the application of the Iran Sanctions Act to any financial institution, insurer, underwriter, guarantor, or other business organization including any foreign subsidiary of the foregoing. Mr. Speaker, this bill enlarges the scope of the ISA sanctions to include the sale of oil or liquefied natural gas tankers. 
   In addition, the bill before us states the sense of Congress that the United States should prevent foreign banks from providing export credits to foreign entities seeking to invest in Iran's energy sector. And in line with the Iran Freedom Support Act, which urged the President to instruct the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. to push for United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran, this bill before us commends the U.N. Security Council for its previous action and urges additional action. 
   H.R. 1400 also restricts U.S. nuclear cooperation with any country that helps Iran's nuclear program or transfers advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran. This puts countries seeking to maintain good relations with the U.S. on notice that we will not allow ourselves to be used as indirect purveyors of nuclear assistance to Iran. 
   Finally, let me emphasize, Mr. Speaker, that this bill speaks directly to the people of Iran. The regime in Tehran continues its brutal crackdown on human rights advocates, on religious and ethnic minorities, on opponents in the universities and the press, and on dissidents in general. And to address their plight, the bill before us expresses the unwavering support of the American people for the tens of millions of Iranians suffering under a brutal medieval regime. 
   We must always remember that we share a common enemy, the regime in Tehran, and a common goal, which is freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for this time. But I mostly want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos, for his leadership on this issue, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support its adoption. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank my good friend Mr. Meek of Florida for presenting this resolution for us today. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution, which honors the life of Rafael Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart, a prominent attorney, an elected official in pre-Castro Cuba, who is also the grandfather, as we have heard, of our esteemed South Florida Congressional colleagues, Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart, as well as their two other brothers, Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart, a very well known television personality and news anchor, and Rafael Diaz-Balart, a prominent South Florida businessman. 
   Their grandfather, Rafael Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart, was a native of Santiago de Cuba, and completed his studies at the University of Havana with a law degree in 1919. While maintaining his law practice, he was also elected city council president and mayor of Banes, and later as a member of the Cuban House of Representatives, similar to our body. 
   Following the 1959 communist takeover by Fidel Castro, Rafael Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart fled to the United States to live in exile with his family. Shortly following, he proudly became a citizen of the United States. Along with his son, Rafael Lincoln, he commenced law school at the University of Madrid, Spain, and in 1965, at the age of 66, earned a second law degree. He sadly passed away in Miami, Florida, in 1985. 
   He, like my father Enrique Ros and so many others who fled Cuba due to Castro's tyrannical regime in the last 50 years, Rafael dreamt of a free Cuba, a country where human rights are respected, where political prisoners are freed, with a democratic, multi-party political system that flourishes and a free market economy that thrives, thus allowing the Cuban people and their foreign economic partners to own their businesses and to prosper. None of those things are allowed today. 
   I am so glad that this Saturday, February 10, the Florida International University College of Law will dedicate its new law center as the Rafael Diaz-Balart Hall. We are also proud of the many accomplishments of FIU, Florida International University, my alma mater, and we think this is a positive step forward. 
   So I ask my colleagues to join us in commemorating the life of a great patriot, Rafael Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart, a tremendous mentor, a loving husband, a father and one of the most outstanding members of the South Florida community, a freedom fighter from his first to his last breath. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on House Resolution 131.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (CONDEMNING ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT OF UNITED STATES TO ASSIST PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution condemns the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and reaffirms the commitment of the United States to assist the people of Pakistan in combating terrorist activity and promoting a free and democratic Pakistan. 
   I would like to commend the author Mr. Ackerman and the distinguished chairman of our committee Mr. Lantos for their leadership in introducing this timely resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of the United States and the Congress, this resolution expresses our sympathy for the people of Pakistan on the tragic assassination of former Prime Minister Bhutto last December 27. It should be noted that, in the immediate aftermath of the attack, both the President and Secretary of State Rice immediately extended condolences to the Bhutto family and the family of others who were killed and wounded on that horrible day. And, as so many observers have noted, Ms. Bhutto's death is a great loss to Pakistan. As Secretary Rice stated, she was a woman of great courage with an impressive commitment to democracy and to the future of Pakistan itself. 
   Madam Speaker, as President Bush has emphasized, the perpetrators of this terrible crime must be brought to justice. In this regard, the Congress joins with the administration in welcoming the government of Pakistan's decision to accept British assistance to the investigation into Ms. Bhutto's death. We all hope that their actions to ensure a credible and transparent investigation of the circumstances surrounding Ms. Bhutto's death will help to restore calm, contribute to the conditions needed for a free and fair election to take place, and bring the perpetrators of her death to justice. 
   The assassination of the former Prime Minister and the apparent attempt to destabilize Pakistan remind us again how consequential this relationship is to American national interests and our own homeland security. It is vital that we continue to seek to forge an enduring relationship and partnership with a democratic, stable, and prosperous Pakistan that remains a strong partner in the campaign against Islamic militants and which maintains responsible control over its nuclear weapons technology. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) be permitted to manage the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the chairman of our committee, Chairman Lantos, for his leadership for so long on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to voice my strong support for the chairman's bill, H.R. 2446, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act, and that's the key part of what we're talking about today, security support. This legislation is the product of the bipartisan cooperation that our committee has shown on an issue of critical importance to the United States and our allies in the war against Islamic militant extremists. 
   Five years ago, our Nation experienced a terrible tragedy, and it led our Nation to destroy the al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan that the brutal Taliban regime had created there. Our focus was to provide a safe, stable and secure Afghanistan that would deny global jihadists a base of operations to conduct their campaign of terror and destruction against our Nation and our critical security interests around the world. 
   Since then, Afghanistan has taken notable steps to emerge from decades of war, of violence, of oppression, toward a prosperous, secure, free, democratic nation. Today, over 5 million Afghan children are in school, including 2 million girls. This was prohibited under the Taliban rule. Hundreds of clinics and new schools are now open to serve the population as a result of international efforts. Media, cultural, business and political leaders are free to meet to discuss, to demonstrate and to guide policies that are transforming their nation across all sectors. 
   The Afghan economy is growing at an incredible rate, and institutional assistance for Afghan economic reconstruction has been forthcoming. Most importantly, the Afghanistan people, through their active direct participation in the political process, have demonstrated their desire to accelerate and ensure the movement of Afghanistan toward modern society. 
   However, challenges to these and other efforts remain, as Mr. Lantos has pointed out. A dramatic increase in illicit opium cultivation is financing and strengthening the Taliban and anticoalition activity. It's increasing crime and corruption, and it is eroding the authority of the central government institutions. 
   Afghanistan's ballooning drug trade has succeeded in expanding the ranks of the Taliban. It is no coincidence that opium and heroin production dramatically increased at the same time that the Taliban-staged massive counteroffensive, particularly in the south of the country. 
   The issue of Taliban and al Qaeda resurgence cannot be considered in a vacuum. In response, this critical legislation seeks to address the current situation in an integrated fashion, to include the confluence of the short-term goals to reduce opium activity and related corruption, while addressing longer-term developmental goals which have an impact on our counterterrorism and our counternarcotics policies and objectives. 
   In particular, within this critical legislation, we have worked to establish the means for developing a long overdue and coherent interdepartmental and counternarcotics strategy that addresses the deadly and the neglected illicit drug trade and its links to radical Islamic terrorism that imperil the future of Afghanistan. 
   In February of this year, I, along with some of my other colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to the administration on the need for an across-the-board policy change on the illicit drug threat fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, the attacks on our coalition troops, and official corruption in Afghanistan. 
   The bill before us incorporates many of the recommendations that we proposed in this letter, and I thank Chairman Lantos for working so closely with us. I believe that his bill will prompt much-needed changes by mandating the appointment of a high level, interdepartmental Afghan coordinator with emphasis on a development of a coherent government-wide counter drug policy. This includes bringing the U.S. military into the fight, providing meaningful support for the drug enforcement administration with an emphasis on interdiction and on the extradition of major drug kingpins. 
   This legislation also contains limitations on assistance to senior Afghan local and provincial government officials who, based on evidence, are found to be supporting Islamic terrorist activities or narco-traffickers or drug producers or are involved in other criminal activities. This important oversight provision will be instrumental in assuring that vital U.S. reconstruction assistance is properly allocated and utilized. 
   I am also pleased that we were able to come to an agreement with Chairman Lantos on the extension of draw-down authority for military equipment, which promotes greater ability to operate with the international security assistance force and other allies in the country of Afghanistan. 
   In addition, the bill ensures that there will be prevetting of the recruits of the Afghan police to help adequately assess the candidates' aptitude, professionals skills, integrity and other qualifications for law enforcement work before they enter the service. Our efforts in Afghanistan, in particular, and our campaign against militant Islamic extremists in general must be pursued in a comprehensive manner. 
   As illustrated by this critical legislation, it requires an effective and unified reconstruction strategy with a unified counternarcotics strategy, counterterrorism strategy, and an Afghan government committed to fighting and eliminating corruption. 
   Only with this comprehensive approach will we accelerate economic development and reconstruction, improve the quality of life for Afghanistan and address the underlying conditions that fuel extremist acts and decisively defeat the jihadist elements that want to once again control Afghanistan. 
   My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, after serving her military tour in Iraq as a marine pilot, is now serving in Afghanistan. We hope that she will be back home with us by Thanksgiving. But we thank every brave man and woman who is wearing our Nation's uniform in Afghanistan, and we thank them for freeing an entire population, and we hope that their contributions will always be celebrated in this House. 
   This bill before us brings us closer to making sure that Afghanistan remains a free country and be without the extremist Islamic elements that seek to destroy it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Pence of Indiana, the ranking member of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee who has traveled to Afghanistan and closely follows the developments there. 
   MR. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank our ranking member from Florida for yielding and the distinguished chairman of the full committee for their work on this important legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act, and I call for its passage. It was reported unanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee last month. Our action today would reauthorize the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 passed 5 years ago this month, just a few short months after our invasion of the country that harbored the September 11 attackers. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is nearly unanimous agreement in this body that the battle currently under way in Afghanistan is in our vital national interests, and it is crucial and central to the war on terror. It is critical that we adequately resource and support our mission and the government and the people of Afghanistan. 
   As with any conflict, there are both positive and troubling signs today in Afghanistan. Challenges facing us include a resurgent Taliban, growing opium trade and slow progress on reconstruction. 
   On the positive side, our forces, in conjunction with NATO, are waging war on the Taliban, pursuing terrorist nests and providing support to the Karzai government. I was able to witness some of the early fruits of these efforts firsthand, along with some of my colleagues in December of 2004 when I visited. As in Iraq, our troops and civilian efforts there are inspiring in difficult and dangerous conditions. 
   Opium production remains a plague that will haunt this country until it is curbed. Tragically, Afghanistan is the world's largest opium producer. As Antonio Maria Costa of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said last year, and I quote, ``Afghanistan's drug situation remains vulnerable to reversal because of mass poverty, lack of security, and the fact that the authorities have inadequate control over its territory.'' 
   And that's why this bill is so important. In this legislation, $1.6 billion per year over the next 3 years are authorized for reconstruction and security assistance, specifically a pilot program of crop substitution to encourage legitimate alternatives to poppy cultivation, as well as an anti-corruption effort. 
   This bill also addresses, as has been alluded to by my colleagues, the continuing humanitarian needs and offers programs for women and children. 
   One of the most inspiring experiences of my life, Mr. Chairman, was during a visit to an American installation in the mountains of Jalalabad where we walked outside of the military base and visited a school which, for the first time, had running water, which, for the first time, more poignantly, had little girls in the classrooms. It was an extraordinary experience as I approached the gates of that school surrounded, as I was, by heavily armed American military personnel, only to see the children run forward out of the gates, embrace those soldiers and greet them, not as the glowering menaces that they might appear to a stranger but as friends. And I stood and marveled as the soldiers taught me words in their native Afghan tongue to greet the children and to be able to speak to them. It was extraordinary. 
   This legislation providing for the humanitarian needs and for programs for women and girls like those which I saw is truly treasure in heaven. 
   This legislation also encourages greater cooperation from friendly countries in the region, and it requires the President to keep Congress informed on the progress of these various issues. 
   Mr. Chairman, our success in Afghanistan will require a multi-tracked effort on numerous fronts in order for the United States to stay on the offensive in the war on terror and to stabilize this key ally in our shared struggle. The Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act is an important and central component in that fight, and I urge its strong support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, the amendment has a noble purpose, to enhance congressional oversight on the status of local governance in Afghanistan, including adherence to the rule of law, protection of human rights and operation of an effective justice system. Unfortunately, the amendment lacks specific criteria by which to measure these issues. It requires the administration to report, for example, on how the lack of implementation of the rule of law affects the operations of the Afghan National Army, the police and security forces. However, there are numerous factors that comprise the rule of law. How would this provision measure implementation of the rule of law? 
   Without a clear measure, how could any administration then state, with any degree of certainty, what effects the absence of such implementation had on the operations of Afghan security forces? It goes on to ask for an assessment on the ability of the Afghan judicial system to support the civil military side of military and police operations. 
   Again, a noble purpose, but there are no clear definitions, no guidelines to determine the information sought. Further, how could we establish a clear measure so that the administration can state how the actions of the Afghan security forces led to human rights abuses, and in turn, how much those abuses undermine counterinsurgency efforts? That is an extraordinary, complicated, causal chain, and some direction and clarification within the amendment itself, Mr. Chairman, would have been most useful. 
   We sought modifications to this amendment in an effort to arrive at an agreement on the text because I do support what my colleague from New York is trying to get at. We want to support the overarching goals of this bill, and his amendment is an attempt to do that. 
   I will continue to work closely with the gentleman from New York regarding his particular amendment to preserve its intent, to make sure that it can be effective in its implementation, but as currently drafted, I will have to oppose the amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment both authorizes and requires oversight by the Inspectors General from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, and it does this in two main ways. 
   First, it requires the permanent deployment in Afghanistan of at least four IG staffers, two each from State and USAID, to audit, to investigate and to oversee economic and developmental assistance provided in Title I of the Act. 
   Secondly, it also earmarks a total of $4.5 million per year for these IG activities. 
   We all share the goal of ensuring that our investment in Afghanistan's economic and democratic development is not squandered. Fiscal accountability is always in order, Mr. Chairman. As a proportion of the total amounts in the Act, the amount earmarked by this amendment is roughly in the ballpark of the amount that USAID usually spends on IG activities as compared to its total budget. Furthermore, the activities contemplated by this amendment are in keeping with the current responsibilities of the State and USAID Inspectors General. 
   Solid plans that help maximize the impact of the strategy embodied in the underlying bill are to be welcomed. In this spirit, I am pleased to support this well-thought-out amendment by the gentleman from California; and I also urge my colleagues to support it as well.

We have our precious treasure, our men and women in uniform, shedding blood for freedom. Let's make sure that American taxpayer dollars are being used in the correct way as well.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of the Franks amendment. Since last April, two arms shipment from Iran, including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, C-4 explosives and small arms have reportedly been intercepted by U.S. and coalition troops. 
   Further, a NATO spokesman recently stated that an explosively formed projectile, EFP, which resembled the EFPs bearing Iranian manufacturing markings that have been found in Iraq, have been recently discovered in Kabul. This directly affects the safety and security of our men and women serving in Afghanistan. As I pointed out previously, my daughter-in-law is one of those wearing our Nation's uniform serving in Afghanistan. We want to make sure that we protect everyone in that country. 
   These disturbing developments may indicate that the Iranian regime has decided to also undermine the government of Afghanistan and U.S. efforts to deny Islamic militants a safe haven in Afghanistan. 
   While fighting in Afghanistan has thus far been concentrated near the Pakistani border, increased Iranian interference in Afghanistan may indicate an attempt to provoke the U.S. and our coalition partners into opening a second front. Iran's apparently increasing involvement in this central front of the global war against radical jihadists reflects the goal of the regime of pursuing regional dominance, spreading radical Islam, and counteracting western influence in the region. Such a goal is intolerable. As in Iraq, failure in Afghanistan is not an option. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act works to bolster our efforts, and I support the Franks amendment.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) stating that technical assistance should be provided to train national, provincial and local government personnel for capacity-building purposes as it relates to education, health care, human rights, and particularly in respect to women and political participation. 
   As we have heard this afternoon, Mr. Chairman, under the Taliban's brutal regime, their blatant disregard for the lives and the well-being of the Afghan people, was perhaps most clearly evident among half of their population, the women of Afghanistan. They have been made destitute, sick and marginalized. They were banned from receiving any education past the age of 8. They were denied proper medical treatment, and they were not allowed to work. 
   Today, the Afghan people are free with women enjoying the freedoms and opportunities previously denied to them under the Taliban. In order for our efforts in Afghanistan to be effective, it is critical that we continue to provide the Afghan people with the tools and the training necessary for the development and sustainability of educational institutions, protection of human rights, and implementation of political reforms. 
   It is imperative that our efforts focus on educating and training the officials of the Afghan government at the local level as local officials have a better understanding of the needs of their citizens and will be better prepared to address those needs. 
   This amendment also seeks to ensure that girls complete secondary education so they will be better suited to pursue their post-secondary education. Without proper education of its women and a society more open to women who holding jobs, Afghanistan's political and economic development is doomed to failure. 
   Providing Afghan girls with proper education will give rise to a new generation of confident and educated women with skills to pursue careers that will open unprecedented opportunities for them and enhance Afghanistan's economic sector. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson-Lee amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) supporting efforts to bolster women's political participation by protecting female legislators when they return to the provinces they represent. 
   This important amendment includes a sense of Congress stating that assistance provided to foreign countries and international organizations under this provision should be used in part to protect these female legislators.  
   It is no secret that Afghan women were brutalized under the Taliban rule. They were frequently beaten, raped, kidnapped and killed. They had no access to education nor health care and were routinely singled out for abuse simply because they were women. They lived in nightmarish conditions that few of us could even imagine. 
   Five years after the fall of the Taliban, the women of Afghanistan are making substantial progress in reclaiming their rightful place in society. They are working as doctors, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and in numerous other professions. 
   These women have overcome unimaginable obstacles, and they deserve our ongoing support as they work to build a new democracy. We must continue to work to ensure that they are not threatened, nor intimidated nor physically harmed by those who seek to bring Afghanistan back to the oppressive and brutal times experienced under the Taliban regime. 
   As part of the work that my daughter-in-law does in her military service in Afghanistan, Lindsay encounters many Afghan women and is impressed with the great progress they have made in such a brief time. Let us not go back in time. 
   Women legislators in Afghanistan are currently targets of attacks perpetrated by Islamic militant extremists. We must enhance the efforts in providing a safe and secure environment for these women to allow them to pursue their legislative duties and encourage future generations of women to seek leadership positions in Afghan society. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. The issue of providing compensation to Afghan civilians is one whose efficacy is not questioned. Our brave troops on the ground offer such support through the allocation of the Commander's Emergency Response Program funding and other avenues that allow U.S. forces to compensate civilians for the damage caused due to ongoing U.S. operations. 
   However, the manner by which my esteemed colleague from Ohio, my good friend, Mr. Kucinich, seeks to go about addressing this issue would establish an extremely troublesome precedent regarding our operations in and our policy toward Afghanistan. 
   Simply put, U.S. taxpayer funds, U.S. assistance for Afghanistan, should not be used to fund long-term compensation programs under the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund of the International Security Assistance Force for damage caused by foreign forces and not U.S. forces. 
   By contrast, the underlying bill acknowledges ongoing U.S. efforts to support war victims affected by U.S. operations and then calls for a feasibility study to be conducted in order to assess if there is a need to expand U.S. assistance to Afghan civilian war victims. 
   The Kucinich amendment, however, seeks to circumvent this necessary precursor, essentially prescribing a solution to this problem before the diagnosis is received, and, again, seeking to assign U.S. responsibility for the actions of others. The United States could work diplomatically with participant nations to ensure that they make proper and substantially greater contributions to this relief fund. 
   However, I find it to be outside of the parameters for the U.S. assistance to Afghanistan to cover the international forces where they have fallen short, thereby putting the onus on the United States to step up financially for damages that we have not created. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

In this respect, U.S.-based organizations, with a proven track record of accountability and cost-effectiveness and the development and administration of such programs in Afghanistan, should be granted priority in the grant process.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague and my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen). 
   This amendment seeks to promote the empowerment of citizens at the local level in the decision-making process, including reconstruction and economic development. 
   One of the key elements necessary to achieve success in Afghanistan is enhancing and promoting citizen participation in the reconstruction and economic development efforts in that country. 
   Citizens making decisions is a critical part in a democratic society, and this will enhance Afghanistan's political and economic institutions. Local participation, local decision-making will allow the Afghan people to take charge of their own lives and make decisions based on the needs of their local communities. 
   In addition to ensuring security, fighting the illicit illegal narcotics trade, related terrorist activities, developing the infrastructure for a sustainable democratic central government, the economic situation must also improve if Afghans are to have confidence in their own future and if they are to build upon the progress they have achieved thus far. 
   A lack of success in the economic forum has the potential to undermine political developments. It could risk demoralizing the aspirations of Afghan citizens and could jeopardize their ability to actively shape their destiny. 
   The United States must work hard to ensure that Afghanistan is never again a haven for terrorists, a major source of narcotics, or a source of instability or oppression towards its citizens. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for introducing this important amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. 
   And before I yield the remainder of our time to my good friend and our fearless leader, Chairman Lantos, I want to thank the excellent staff that has been working on our Republican side with the Democratic side on forging this strong bill; and perhaps next time, Mr. Lantos, we will come to the floor wearing tie-dyed T-shirts and love beads and singing Kumbaya.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, thank you for bringing up this important resolution to this floor today. And I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 272, which recognizes the historical significance of the abolition of transatlantic slave trade. It respects the memory of those who perished as a result of slavery. It supports preservation of related historical documents, and it urges greater education about this sad period in history for both current and future generations.     
   While addressing the Community of Democracies' opening plenary in Chile on April 29, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated: ``We at the Community of Democracies must use the power of our shared ideals to accelerate democracy's movement to ever more places around the globe. We must usher in an era of democracy that thinks of tyranny as we thought of slavery today: a moral abomination that could not withstand the natural desire of every human being for a life of liberty and of dignity.'' 
   While Secretary Rice's remarks were specifically on the promotion of democracy around the world, she reminded us of a very unsettling fact. Even 200 years after the abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom and nearly 145 years after the Emancipation Proclamation in our United States, slavery still exists in the modern world. It exists through tyranny. It exists through oppression. It exists where human rights and freedom are systematically repressed. 
   Secretary Rice's statement serves as a call to action for those of us who would seek to break the shackles of tyranny and promote human dignity around the world. 
   I appreciate the bipartisan fashion by which we have sought to heed the Secretary's call and to recognize the significance of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, as evidenced by our consideration today of both this resolution by the Congresswoman from California (Ms. Lee) and House Resolution 158, offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts). Collectively, these resolutions remind us of the courage and the fortitude of those who came before us to fight the scourge of slavery, while helping us come to terms with our own shameful past. 
   I believe that there would be no better way to respect the memory of those forced to suffer under the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, or to honor those who dedicated themselves to its abolition, than to stand together today in a bipartisan fashion and publicly recommit ourselves to the eradication of slavery and the promotion of human rights around the world. 
   Madam Speaker, I again thank you for bringing this important resolution to the floor. 
   Madam Speaker, because I know that the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentlewoman from California have many speakers on their side, except for the 2 minutes that I would like to yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) to comment on this important resolution, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this week being Olympic Week in America in our Nation's elementary schools, there is no better time for us to extend our congratulations to the City of Chicago for being selected to represent the United States in the competition to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games. 
   Chicago is a world-class city, known for its culture, history, people and love of sports, and pizza, and the Bears and the Bulls. 
   In addition, it boasts renowned architecture and a significant transportation infrastructure and numerous venue options for major events such as the Olympic games. 
   This is the first step in the international process whereby the final selection for the site of the games will be made in October 2009. Chicago's likely rivals in the 2016 competitions include Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Tokyo, Madrid and Prague. Other than Miami, of course, I can think of no better city to represent the United States of America in its bid for the Olympics games than Chicago. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), for introducing the bill before us, House Resolution 158, which observes the 200th anniversary of the end of the British slave trade and commends the heroic legacy of William Wilberforce, the outspoken British parliamentarian and Christian who was instrumental in its abolition. 
   The African slave trade was a heinous practice that inflicted degradation and misery on those millions of people whose human dignity it denied or destroyed. 
   In celebrating the 200th anniversary of Britain's abolition of the slave trade, we cannot help but reflect on the tragic fact that it took the United States another six decades and a wrenching Civil War to do the same, to begin living more fully according to the principles of our Founding Fathers. 
   I commend the author of this resolution, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), for focusing on the challenges of the present day, in addition to the sins of the past. 
   Although the scourge of formalized slavery has been eliminated in the west and for much, but not all, of the rest of the world, millions of women, children and men suffer similar severe assaults on their dignity and liberty today as victims of trafficking, sexual servitude, and forced labor. 
   This resolution is a welcomed opportunity to publicly recommit ourselves to the protection of human dignity. In the words of the man whom we honor in our resolution, William Wilberforce, he said, ``Let us act with an energy suited to the importance of the interests for which we contend, stimulated by a consciousness of what we owe to the laws of God and the rights and happiness of man.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) be allowed to control the remainder of our time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, were we seen as occupiers in Haiti, in Bosnia? Do we not, as some have said on Iraq, have a sustained military presence in these countries? Did we not intervene in Haiti to restore democracy and remain to prevent the increased violence? 
   In fact, as our distinguished Speaker, whom we'll be hearing from in just a few moments, when she argued for a sustained U.S. deployment in Bosnia, Speaker Pelosi said, Is the Bosnian mission without danger and risk? No. With strong leadership there are always risks. These risks have been minimized. They are risks for peace, risks for ending years of bloodshed, risks for freedom. We risk far more by failing to act.     
   We risk far more if we allow the tenuous peace to collapse and watch the flames of war ignite again. I agreed with Speaker Pelosi then when she said that on December 13 of 1995, and I agreed with her when she said on September 19 of 1994, when advocating for a sustained U.S. presence in Haiti, the Speaker said, setting a date certain for troop withdrawal will unnecessarily endanger both our troops on the ground and our efforts at promoting democracy in Haiti. 
   I say that we have no less at stake here in Iraq. The bill before us, as we have said before, is a fine bill. We support what it seeks to do because, in fact, it is law. It is already United States law. 
   We want to make sure that the Iraqi people have the same level of commitment that we have shown to other oppressed people throughout the world. We should not ignore the consequences of a rapid withdrawal from Iraq in a vitally important region of the world. 
   But, like I have said, this is not the issue addressed in this bill. Some have remarked about the greater issue of Iraq in their discourse today. On the bill before us, it is already public law. We have passed it six times in the House. It has been law three times, and we have no objection to the bill becoming law a fourth time, a fifth time or a sixth time. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment put forth about by my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson), which would overturn a long-standing bipartisan moratorium on new gas drilling. 
   Under Mr. Peterson's amendment, we could see drilling for natural gas as close as 25 miles from our precious coastlines. Despite claims by its supporters, the Peterson amendment is not a viable short-term nor long-term solution to our energy needs. Instead, this proposal could damage sensitive habitats and undermine the economic future of our coastal towns and cities. 
   In my own congressional district, I am privileged to represent such underwater treasures as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the most extensive living coral reef system in the Continental United States. 
   In addition to its aesthetic value, this marine ecosystem also supports tourism and commercial fishing, the economic livelihood of the Florida Keys. Any offshore oil drilling near this area could place thousands of rare and vulnerable marine plant species in harm's way and could potentially cripple the local economy. 
   Furthermore, drilling structures along the gulf coast would be located in the middle of hurricane alley. Proponents of this amendment say that current production methods safeguard against any environmental damage resulting from a tropical storm or a hurricane. Mr. Chairman, as many of us know firsthand, sadly, there is no such thing as being hurricane proof. Given the scientific likelihood for stronger and more frequent storms in the gulf and along our Atlantic coast, offshore oil drilling presents a sizable risk of onshore damage and water pollution in the event of the next big one. 
   I encourage my colleagues' help in making sure that we can protect Florida's coastline as well as our Nation's ecosystem by voting ``no'' on the Peterson amendment. 
   My Florida colleague, my good friend (Mr. Mica), who, as he states, favors drilling even in the Everglades, says that it is fear versus facts. Well, Mr. Chairman, the fact is that the Florida Keys depends on the 4 million tourists who come to the area every year for its economic livelihood. The debate is not about fear. It is about economic reality. Our coastal towns and cities will be devastated financially with the adoption of the Peterson amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Peterson amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The alarming rate of crime and violence in the Caribbean region cannot be ignored. Several countries have reached the point of crisis, while attempting to counter the social, economic and political repercussions of organized gangs and narcotrafficking. 
   Murder rates in the Caribbean are higher than in any other region in the world, and have risen in recent years for many of the countries in the region. Recent increases in kidnappings have been observed in the region over the past few years, and assault rates, based on police reports, are significantly above the world average. 
   Serving as seemingly insurmountable obstacles to the economic and social progress of countries in the Caribbean, the pervasive nature of crime and violence again cannot be ignored. We have a shared responsibility to confront this threat and engage in coordinated efforts that improve the quality of life for all of our communities. 
   The security threats faced in the Western Hemisphere as a result of violence and narcotrafficking call for strong action on the part of our government. So far, our partnerships with countries throughout the hemisphere are demonstrating significant success in the fight against drugs and crime; such as the case of Colombia, where substantial improvements in security have yielded positive patterns of growth, stability, and investment. 
   We have good reason to be optimistic, Mr. Speaker. The deadly flow of  cocaine into the United States has seen a dramatic decline in the last few months. Purity levels are falling, and retail prices are rising. 
   We must remain committed to defeating the perilous threats of crime and violence that endanger the youth and prosperity of our Nations today. Together, we must tackle these challenges and strive to further tighten the bonds that hold us together as nearby neighbors. 
   I am confident that through future cooperation and coordination, we can continue to see success and support the true potential of our friends in the Caribbean. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (WELCOMING HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XVI ON HIS FIRST APOSTOLIC VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H. Res. 838 extending this Chamber's welcome to Pope Benedict XVI who will be making his first visit to the United States next week in his role as leader of the Catholic Church. 
   Pope Benedict was elected to the Papacy just 3 years ago, succeeding Pope John Paul II, who had led the Catholic Church for close to three decades. 
   The Holy Father's visit provides an opportunity to reflect on his life and his teachings. Pope Benedict has devoted his life to his faith and to the promotion of peace. From his early days as a priest, he has also sought to inspire others to always search for the truth. 
   On May 28, 1977, over 30 years ago, he declared that his duty was to ``follow the truth and be at its service.'' On that occasion, he went on to say, ``In today's world the theme of truth is omitted almost entirely, as something too great for man, and yet everything collapses if truth is missing.'' 
   Moreover, Pope Benedict has spent his years of service in the church in an effort to clarify the tenets of the Catholic faith. After serving as president of the commission that reviewed the Catholic Catechism, he presented a new Catechism to Pope John Paul II. 
   To date, he has written 25 books, which are now used as reference sources for many who are interested in a deeper study of theology. He served as the adviser of theological affairs to the Second Ecumenical Vatican Council, a gathering of great importance that was the largest in the church's history. This council adopted significant changes in the doctrines of the Catholic Church and its central legacy--its reforms--were meant to ensure that the heart of the church and its mission would be focused on helping people. 
   The council urged greater engagement by the church to elevate the dignity of all human life, to ease suffering, end poverty in needy countries, and to promote international peace. This council was also intent on encouraging reconciliation between those in the Catholic Church and those of other beliefs. 
   Since ascending to the Papacy in April of 2005, the Pope has advanced those doctrines in church affairs, particularly in inter-religious dialogue. 
   On September 7, 2007, Pope Benedict visited Austria, where he joined Jewish leaders in a silent tribute to the victims of the Nazi Holocaust, and he joined Vienna's chief rabbi in a memorial to the 65,000 Viennese Jews who perished in Nazi death camps. 
   During his time in the United States, he will visit the Park Street Synagogue in New York City and he will meet with Holocaust survivor Rabbi Arthur Schneier. 
   Monsignor David Malloy, general secretary of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said of this meeting: ``By this personal and informal visit, which is not part of his official program, His Holiness wishes to express his good will toward the local Jewish community as they prepare for Passover.'' 
   In October of 2006, Pope Benedict met with the Dalai Lama in the Vatican. And when he visited Turkey, he prayed at the Blue Mosque, and he now plans to meet with Muslim scholars and religious leaders at a Catholic-Muslim seminar to be held later this year in Rome. 
   Pope Benedict has underscored his support for interfaith reconciliation with statements such as the following: ``If friendship with God becomes for us something even more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Pope Benedict's wise words of inspiration, hope, and peace can serve to guide all of us. It is my pleasure to rise in support of this resolution welcoming His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In this debate on Iraq, we must always be aware that the remarks are not to be confined only to the American people. Our words will be heard not just by our friends but by our enemies also. They are watching to see what America will do. No weakness of ours, no internal political struggle will go unnoticed. 
   The suicide bombers, the leaders of al Qaeda, the rulers of Iran, many others are listening, seeking encouragement for their fellow extremists, listening for signs of our defeat. 
   We know from many sources that al Qaeda, the terrorists in Iraq, and our enemies planning further attacks on us closely follow what is said and what is done in the United States and use that knowledge to help them calculate their next steps against us. They routinely cite statements by U.S. sources as validation of their strategy to defeat America. 
   Let me quote Muhammad Saadi, a senior leader of the Islamic jihad, who said that talk of withdrawal from Iraq makes him feel ``proud.'' He said: ``As Arabs and Muslims we feel proud, very proud from the great successes of the Iraqi resistance, this success that brought the big superpower of the world to discuss a possible withdrawal.'' 
   They are looking for concessions of defeat, signs of weakness, and it is within this context that we embark on this debate today. 
   The question before us concerns not the past but the future. Where should our country go from here? We are not merely debating a resolution, but we are deliberating on our Nation's future. 
   The war in Iraq is but a part of a far larger struggle, a global struggle, the struggle against Islamic extremist militants. As in the Cold War, our current struggle is one of survival. The enemy does not mean merely to chase us away. The goal of the Islamic extremist radicals is to destroy us. If we run, they will pursue. If we cower, they will strike. 
   The choice before us is this: Do we fight and defeat the enemy, or do we retreat and surrender? We must not fool ourselves into believing that we can accommodate our enemies and thereby secure their cooperation. We should not believe that the enemies' demands are limited and reasonable and thus easily satisfied or that we can find safety by withdrawing from the world. This strategy has been tried in the past with catastrophic consequences. 
   Neville Chamberlain genuinely believed that he had brought ``peace in our time'' by washing his hands of what he believed to be an isolated dispute in what he termed ``a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing.'' That country was Czechoslovakia, and Chamberlain's well-intentioned efforts to withdraw Britain from the problems in that far-away region only ensured that an immensely larger threat was thereby unleashed. 
   The threat of Hitler did not appear suddenly out of a vacuum. The challenges that we face today thus have been building for many years. 
   We experienced the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. The destruction of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1998, the attack on the USS Cole in 2000, and then most dramatically the attack on our Nation on 9/11. 
   As these attacks built over the years, we did little in response. Our enemies came to believe that they could strike us with impunity and that we would shrink from our responsibilities, from defending our interests, that we would not stand up for our very own survival. They felt safe in planning for larger attacks. 
   Now our fight is truly one of global proportions. Some may not want to believe it. The terrorists, however, are certain to believe it. As stated by senior al Qaeda leader al Zawahiri, `` ..... Jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals. The first stage: expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage: establish an Islamic authority or emirate, then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of a caliphate, over as much territory as you can, to spread its power in Iraq.'' 
   He continues: ``The third stage: extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq. The fourth stage: It may coincide with what came before, the clash with Israel, because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity.'' 
   These are the words of al Zawahiri, not my words. And this al Qaeda leader went on to say: ``The whole world is an open field for us.'' 
   What then are the consequences of a U.S. withdrawal and surrender? The terrorists, our mortal enemies, will have demonstrated that they have defeated us, the strongest power on Earth. They will have proven that our enemies only have to make the cost too high for us and that we will give up. The result would be an extraordinary boost to their morale and standing in the world, resulting from such a historic and momentous accomplishment on their part. They will become heroes in the minds of millions. They will be inundated with recruits, with financing, with support of all types.     
   And they will be eager to go after us.  
   A leader of the terrorist organization Islamic Jihad recently said of an American withdrawal from Iraq, ``There is no chance that the resistance will stop.'' He said an American withdrawal from Iraq would ``prove that resistance is the most important tool and that this tool works. The victory of the Iraqi revolution will mark an important step in the history of the region and in the attitude regarding the United States.'' 
   These are his words, not mine. 
   We know that the terrorists would draw these conclusions because they have done so before when we recoiled in the face of terrorist attacks. In bin Laden's 1996 Declaration of Jihad and other statements, bin Laden repeatedly pointed to America's weakness being its low threshold for pain. As evidence, he pointed to the U.S. withdrawal from Somalia in 1993 because of casualties from attacks by al Qaeda and its allies. 
   Bin Laden said, ``When tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and one American pilot was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu, you left the area carrying disappointment, humiliation, defeat and your dead with you. The extent of your impotence and your weakness became very clear.'' 
   These are bin Laden's words, not mine. 
   We witnessed the consequences of Somalia and the ensuing inaction. However, the implications for withdrawal and surrender in Iraq could be even greater. There would be an intensification of the violence. 
   As the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq recently affirmed, ``If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.'' 
   Iraq would become, as one of my Democratic colleagues said in December of 2005, a ``snakepit for terrorists.'' 
   Sunni Arabs throughout the Middle East would certainly view the resulting situation as a Shiite victory in Iraq and, in turn, as a win for the regime in Iran. Neighboring countries would likely seek to prevent Iranian domination of Iraq and the region by providing financial and other support, including potentially troops, to anti-Iranian factions. 
   It would be interpreted as a defeat of the U.S. and would thus strengthen rogue regimes in Syria and Iran. Iran would be free to expand its influence throughout the Middle East, including its long-term effort to dominate the Persian Gulf and the world's oil supply. 
   Iran's sponsorship of terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah would likely increase, thereby ensuring the murder of countless civilians and a further destabilization of countries in the region and indeed beyond. 
   Let us not forget that Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, twice attacked in our own hemisphere, in Argentina, in the mid-1990s. Let us not forget that in 2002 a court case in the United States found that one of two men were convicted of financing Hezbollah of $2 million in illegal activity here in the United States and that last year an individual from Detroit was charged with supporting Hezbollah financially and was described by the United States Attorney in the case as a ``fighter, recruiter and a fundraiser.'' 
   Let us not forget that Iran is a nation believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons, and thus leaving the region vulnerable to Iranian domination, and that would have grave consequences for the U.S. security priorities. 
   Surrendering Iraq over to the terrorists would erode the trust of the U.S. in that region and affect our critical regional interests in the entire neighborhood. Our allies, such as Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain and Egypt may become reluctant to continue their cooperation with us, which currently includes providing access to their facilities, logistical support that we need to protect our interests in the region. 
   The damage would not be confined, however, to the Middle East. Our enemies would be encouraged to join forces in a coalition to directly challenge the United States and expand their efforts to undermine us and our allies. 
   It is already happening. Venezuela's strongman Hugo Chavez is openly forming an alliance with Iran, and recently called on Iran and Venezuela to join forces to ``finish off the U.S. empire,'' quoting him. 
   Let us consider the consequences of withdrawing and surrendering Iraq to Islamic militant extremists. As James Woolsey, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has emphasized, ``We have to do our damndest to win this thing, in spite of the history of mistakes in tactics and strategy. The stakes are too high to do otherwise. The whirlwind we will reap if we lose means that we owe it to the world and to future generations to do everything humanly possible to avoid giving the Islamists the encouragement they will certainly obtain if they win.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not just an abstract policy discussion for me. This is a subject close to my heart. My stepson Doug and his wife Lindsay are both marine pilots who served in Iraq alongside many other brave Americans. They understand the consequences of defeat. They recognize the deadly enemy that we are facing. 
   Lindsay will soon be deployed to Afghanistan, in just a few weeks, where, depending on our actions in this Chamber this week, she could face a more deadly enemy. All of us, all of us long for a world in which the mortal challenge of Islamic militant extremism does not exist. But that world is a fantasy, and that is the world that this resolution seems to address. 
   Many times in our history we have met with great challenges, and many of them seemed insurmountable. And yet every time we rose to face them, and we prevailed. We are faced once again with an overwhelming challenge, that of Islamic militant extremists focused on our destruction and on world domination. There is no path backward, there is no retreat, because that will only bring disaster. 
   I am saddened that some in this Chamber have felt the need on this floor to characterize the decision of our young men and women to join the military as being motivated by money, by bonuses and by other financial benefits, rather than their patriotism. 
   My stepson Doug and my daughter-in-law Lindsay are both college graduates. Doug is a graduate of the University of Miami. Lindsay is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and has a master's in English. They have many, many opportunities they could have pursued. They chose to serve their country, because they and many others are patriots. They did not do it for bonuses. They did not do it for money. 
   Let us not just support our troops. Let us support their mission. And their mission is to defeat the Islamic extremists. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I also rise in strong support of House Resolution 24, reestablishing the House Democracy Assistance Commission for this 110th Congress. I was an enthusiastic cosponsor of the legislation creating the commission in the year 2005, and I am proud of what it has accomplished during these years. 
   Our colleagues, as Mr. Lantos mentioned, Mr. Dreier and Mr. Price, deserve our thanks for their hard work and identifying candidate legislatures in emerging democracies to receive commission assistance. The 12 partner countries selected so far include nations of strategic importance to all of us, such as Afghanistan and Lebanon. They include the largest Muslim majority nation on Earth, Indonesia, which has emerged from authoritarian dictatorship to become the world's third largest democracy. 
   It includes countries that have overcome Soviet-era communism such as Georgia, Mongolia and Ukraine. They include one of the world's newest nations, East Timor. It also includes important neighbors in the hemisphere such as Colombia and Haiti and friends in Africa, among many others. To these nations, the commission provides not only technical support, but moral support as well. 
   Many of us have heard of how much democratic reformers and parliamentarians overseas appreciate the formal relationships with the House provided by this commission. All of us here know democracy is more than just about holding an election. It is also about building responsive institutions that can earn the public trust and the public's allegiance. 
   To be effective in a democratic context, legislatures must have the independent capacity for research, for analysis and for legal drafting. So the expanding programming that the commission plans to undertake during this Congress is vitally important, Madam Speaker. 
   I have no doubt that the commission will continue to do great things with the limited resources that it shares with our Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
   It represents a modest investment in sharing with the people of the world one of our most treasured legacies, government of the people, by the people, for the people. For these reasons, Madam Speaker, this resolution before us deserves our unanimous support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (SUDAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Bachus and Mr. Frank for their leadership on this critical issue. And I am proud to rise in strong support of the bill before us, Senate bill 2271, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. The timing of this bill is critical, Mr. Speaker, because as we speak, the United Nations is engaged in yet another effort to convince the regime in Khartoum to stop its foot-dragging and finally facilitate the deployment of a robust United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping force in Darfur. It has been 4 months since this force was approved by the United Nations Security Council, 4 months. And according to the timeline set by Security Council Resolution 1769, the hybrid mission is expected to take over full operational control from the overextended and underresourced African Union peacekeeping mission at the end of this month. But here we are more than halfway through this month, and the chances of this happening appear bleaker than ever. 
   True to form, Khartoum has reneged on its promises and effectively blocked international efforts to get a credible peacekeeping mission deployed to Darfur. First, they rejected the deployment of non-African forces into Darfur. Then they failed to provide land for bases. Then they imposed onerous restrictions on air travel for the mission. And, finally, they resorted to impounding critical U.N. communications equipment and insisted that they have the right to jam the peacekeeping mission's communications for what they called ``security purposes.'' 
   Never before have I seen a country being given ostensibly a veto over the selection of peacekeeping troops to be deployed pursuant to a binding chapter 7 resolution. Never before have I encountered a regime with the audacity to suggest that it has the right to jam U.N. communications so that it can continue conducting attacks in violation of a cease-fire agreement against the very people the peacekeeping mission has been sent to protect. This is completely unacceptable. 
   In response to the Khartoum regime's continued games, the United States representative to the U.N. has once again referenced the need for the imposition of broader Security Council sanctions against Sudan. This is a welcome development, and I urge all members of the Security Council, including China, to follow suit and to finally impose crippling sanctions against the murderous regime in Khartoum. 
   But given the inability of the U.N. to take effective action against Khartoum, I am not holding my breath. Instead, let's encourage our colleagues today to join us in an effort to inflict real financial pain upon the genocidal regime by supporting the bill before us, Senate bill 2271, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. It allows  State and local governments to divest from companies whose business dealings directly benefit Khartoum while providing safe harbor for fund managers who choose to divest. 
   I thank Mr. Bachus and Mr. Frank again for their leadership on this issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill before us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from California for the time. 
   I am extremely pleased, Mr. Speaker, that we are considering the Peru Free Trade Agreement tonight. The decision to move forward with legislation that expands our commercial relations with Peru signals the importance that this agreement holds for U.S. economic and security interests in the Andean region and, in fact, in Latin America as a whole. The benefits to both of our countries are significant. 
   By removing barriers on our exports to Peru, this agreement will add $2.1 billion per year to our U.S. economy. The positive impact will be felt across the country. With almost one-fifth of the total bilateral merchandise trade between the U.S. and Peru moving through my home State of Florida, I know firsthand the importance of this agreement for our home State economies and our constituents. 
   Within the first year of the agreement's implementation, Florida's total economic output is estimated to rise by $143 million and total earnings for Florida's workers are estimated to be $35 million higher than in the absence of this free trade agreement. The benefits that Peru currently enjoys under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act only stand to multiply under passage of this FTA. By enhancing these opportunities for economic growth via the free trade agreement, the U.S. is strengthening legal economies that provide viable alternatives to illicit drug production. More than mere trade deals, these agreements are a major factor in defining the future of U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere and our commitment to a strong, stable, democratic neighbor. 
   Therefore, although we are focused tonight, Mr. Speaker, on the agreement with Peru, we cannot lose sight of its importance within the broader regional context of the pending agreements with Colombia and Panama. For example, recent studies show that if the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is not approved and those with Peru and Panama are, Colombia's GDP will be hurt by over 2 percent. Reinforcing Colombia's economy is a prerequisite to its ability to continue to fight the drug lords and the FARC terrorists. President Uribe of Colombia has committed himself and his country to the principles of a secure, more democratic society amidst a growing tide of authoritarian regimes in the region. And there will be a significant cost to the American economy from the failure to approve the Colombian Free Trade Agreement. Over 600,000 jobs in the United States are estimated to depend on exports to Colombia, jobs that will be put at risk if that trade agreement is not approved. 
   Each of the trade agreements is an important element in our twin goals of ensuring our continued economic growth and reinforcing our allies in the region. 
   I strongly support passage of this bipartisan agreement, and I urge my colleagues to do as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support House Resolution 575, which commends the people and the Government of Jordan for their commitment to democracy. Today, much of the Middle East is sadly pervaded by tyranny, radical and extremist Islam, terrorism and hatred of the United States and Israel. However, Jordan continues to stand out as a nation committed to moderation, to modernity, to democracy and to peace with the United States and Israel. 
   Madam Speaker, Jordan has taken the road less traveled in the Middle East, demonstrating to other nations the benefits of embracing democratic principles as the norm. Since 1989, Jordan has held four elections for its parliament, and King Abdullah has committed to holding the next set of elections by November of this year. Under a new election law passed in February, Jordanians went to the polls in late July, for the first time, to elect the mayors and the councils of every city and town in that country. 
   Jordan has also recognized that democracy is much more than just holding elections. The Jordanian Government is acting to establish the rule of law, to build a civil society, to build strong institutions and to broaden political participation to meaningfully engage citizens from all walks of life. 
   One example of this commitment, Madam Speaker, is the decision of the Government of Jordan to lower the voting age from 19 to 18 and to mandate that women fill at least 20 percent of council seats. This is a positive first step, and I hope that it will lead to further reforms and political participation. 
   King Abdullah himself has courageously spoken out and led the way for reform. King Abdullah recently stated, ``We in Jordan, and many others throughout the Middle East, are working hard to create a civic environment in which our people will thrive. The basic requirement is an inclusive, democratic civil society, one that guarantees rights, delegates responsibilities, honors merit, and rewards achievement. The foundation stones on which we build are peace and stability, basic civil and political rights, essential services, freedom of expression and the rule of law.'' 
   Madam Speaker, a stable, peaceful and free Middle East is in the interests of the United States and indeed the entire world. And while much remains to be done, Jordan is serving as a model for other nations. It deserves our friendship and encouragement. 
   House Resolution 575 is particularly important. It expresses the House's desire that Jordan's progress toward democracy continues and flourishes as a model for other Arab countries. It also commends King Abdullah and the Jordanian people for upholding women's rights and enhancing the participation of women in the political process. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, it reaffirms the special relationship that exists between the citizens of our two nations, as well as our ongoing commitment to helping Jordan, should it so desire, in promoting democratic reform. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure, Madam Speaker, and I urge  my colleagues to render their full support for its adoption. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 377, the United States-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act. 
   This bill, introduced by Senator Lugar, and already passed by the Senate in March, would establish a formal parliamentary youth exchange program for American and Polish secondary students. The purpose of this exchange program is to demonstrate to the youth of Poland and to the United States the benefits of friendly cooperation based on our shared political and cultural values. 
   The United States and Poland have enjoyed close bilateral relations since the end of the Cold War. Poland has supported U.S.-led efforts to fight global terrorism, has contributed troops to coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has cooperated closely with the United States to promote democracy and human rights around the world and to reform the United Nations.     
   By focusing on the source of our common future, our young people, this bill will further cement the friendship and the ideals that our two nations already  share. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile endeavor.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3062, the Pacific Island Economic and Educational Development Act. The island nations of the South Pacific, which include longstanding friends of the United States, face continuing challenges in development and education. 
   I want to commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment (Mr. Faleomavaega) for his leadership in introducing this legislation and for working with us in the committee to refine it during the committee process. 
   Because the amended text deals with authorizations, not mandates or appropriations, it signals congressional interest in deepening our cooperation with the people of the Pacific Islands, while also allowing executive branch agencies appropriate discretion in carrying out such programs. 
   The text before us will increase the amounts authorized for U.S. educational and cultural exchanges with South Pacific nations to $1 million in each of the next 2 fiscal years, establish a Fulbright exchange program for Pacific Island students, and underscore the interests of the United States Congress in making appropriate USAID technical assistance available to Pacific Island governments. 
   I thank the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) for accommodating some of our suggested changes. I am pleased to support the amended text.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today also in support of House Resolution 34, which honors the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, South Africa; and an outspoken advocate for peace, equality, and human rights around the globe. 
   While Archbishop Tutu is regarded by some as a controversial figure, he is universally recognized as a hero in the struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa. There he served as a beacon of hope, committed to peace and unity in an era marked by violence and oppression. He passionately advocated for nonviolent opposition to the racist apartheid regime while campaigning internationally for the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa. 
   And even in the face of the most egregious human rights abuses reinforced by draconian laws, including the Population Registration Act of 1950, the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Lands Act of 1954 and 1955, and the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, he inspired disenfranchised South Africans to believe that one day justice would prevail and freedom would come.

   In recognition of his efforts to peacefully protest an immoral and unjust system while leading some 20 million South Africans toward freedom, Desmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In presenting the award, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized that the repression of the apartheid regime was so brutal that ``a violent rebellion would be an understandable reaction.'' However, he stated, that on a broad front a campaign that is being fought with the weapons of spirit and reason, a campaign for truth, freedom, and justice, the contribution that Desmond Tutu has made and is still making represents a hope for the future. He is an exponent of the only form of conflict solving which is worthy of civilized nations. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Following the dismantling of the apartheid regime and the conduct of South Africa's first democratically contested multi-party elections in 1994, Archbishop Tutu was appointed to share South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
   Tasked with investigating the gross human rights violations that had occurred over the preceding 34 years, it was feared that the TRC would reopen old wounds and once again plunge the country into crisis. However, Archbishop Tutu used this platform to urge forgiveness and reconciliation rather than revenge for past injustices. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that South Africa's TRC now serves as a model for post-conflict resolutions around the globe. And at nearly 76 years of age, Archbishop Tutu has not slowed down a bit. Given his continued advocacy for peace and human rights in Africa and beyond, it is appropriate that this body honor him again today. 
   I would like to thank the sponsor, Ms. Jackson-Lee, for introducing this important resolution and for agreeing to changes so that it reflects a celebration of his upcoming 76th birthday, which will be celebrated by all of us on October 7.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to first rise in support of House Resolution 508, introduced by my good friend, Mr. Saxton of New Jersey, and I would like to congratulate him for offering this resolution before us today because the United States security objectives in the Asia-Pacific region could not be achieved without the staunch support of our friends and allies in Tokyo. The United States-Japan alliance is, as this resolution recognizes, the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity. 
   When Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon last fall, we relied heavily on our good friend, Japan, which was then serving as president of the U.N. Security Council. Together, we achieved passage of Security Council Resolution 1718 condemning North Korea's reckless action and imposing a series of sanctions. We must continue to work with Tokyo to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis in order to ensure regional peace and stability. 
   Japan has also been an irreplaceable partner in support of our efforts to fight global terrorism. Also, in the year 2002, Tokyo graciously offered to host the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan following the ouster of the Taliban regime. 
   We are also very grateful to Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces for continuing to provide logistical support in the Indian Ocean to coalition efforts waging the international war on terrorism. 
   Most recently, the Japanese Diet approved a 2-year extension of the Special Measures Law in Iraq which provides continued funding for the reconstruction of a peaceful and stable Iraq. It was also recently reported that three Japanese banks have stopped engaging in any new business with Iran, and that Japanese financial institutions are restricting loans and rejecting an Iranian request to pay for oil imports in currencies other than dollars. 
   We are proud of the U.S.-Japan alliance and deeply grateful for the friendship of the people of Japan. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, Madam Speaker, which is of vital importance to the security of both the United States and Japan. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the author of this resolution, Mr. Saxton of New Jersey.

   This resolution allows the Members of this House the opportunity to extend our profound condolences to the people of Greece and to their government over the tragic losses endured during the recent fires in Greece which have claimed the lives of scores of people. 
   The human toll in casualties, injuries and loss of property is difficult to bear, with an estimated 4,000 people having lost loved ones, homes and, indeed, even communities. 
   Moreover, hundreds of thousands of acres of Greek forests and farmland have been obliterated. And all of this, Madam Speaker, has occurred as a result of the more than 3,000 forest fires that have broken out in Greece since June. 
   This massive tragedy has been bravely shouldered by the people of Greece. The heartfelt thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this tragedy and with all of the people of Greece. 
   United in friendship, the United States and Greece have stood together on the same side of many of the world challenges throughout the last century. It is appropriate, therefore, that we provide assistance and support to our friend and ally in this hour of need. 
   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this resolution and, in so doing, express their condolences and pledge their support for efforts to relieve the suffering endured by the people of Greece as a result of the tragic fires that have ravaged their nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It has been 7 years since the unimaginable happened, unimaginable, but nevertheless all too real. 
   It is difficult to believe that the months and the years have passed so quickly for some, so slowly for others. But although the passage of time cannot erase the scars, it often shows mercy by soothing the raw wounds of experience and transforming them into memory. And that is our purpose here today, Madam Speaker, to remember, to remember the victims and to remind ourselves of the hatred that fuels the enemies of freedom and their desire to destroy us, to destroy our homeland, to destroy everything that we represent. 
   Every American and millions around the globe remember that day, remember where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news and turned on their televisions. They remember the numbing shock and the horror of that day. All wanted to do something to help, and yet there seemed at that time to be so little that could be done to relieve the suffering and the fear.  
   Thank God that there were men and women in a position to help and who did so at great risk and at great cost to themselves. We honor those individuals for their bravery, none of whom sought fame, many of whom lost their lives so that others might live. 
   But while it is appropriate that we remember the events of that day, that we mourn those whom we lost and celebrate the many heroes, our attention should not be fixed entirely on the past for the attack on us was not a single blow but the declaration of a war. 
   We suddenly learned that this war had already been fought against us for many years and in many places, but we had not recognized it for what it was. We had the taking of our embassy and Americans hostages in Iran in 1979, the bombing of our embassy compound and the Marine attacks in Beirut in the early 1980s, the first World Trade Center bombing by Islamic terrorists in 1993, and the attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, the USS Cole, and our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, also in the 1990s. 
   The goal of our self-proclaimed enemies is not to defeat us but to destroy us. For they must destroy us if they are to destroy the civilization we represent which they have defined as their ultimate aim. Their fantasies cannot be made true as long as we exist to stop them. 
   This is a new type of war, Madam Speaker, which presents unfamiliar challenges, and it will test us in ways for which the methods of the past have only a limited use. 
   Securing victory will task our mental and material resources and will require innovative approaches and unconventional solutions. But our courage, our steadfastness, our determination will be as greatly challenged. 
   In the 7 years since we were attacked, we have come to know our enemies, we have come to know their plans and their methods of operation.     
   As we see them more clearly, we are increasingly able to uncover their networks and locate their hiding places. But we should not expect an easy success. Our enemies have many allies and have sunk deep roots that will not easily be torn out. 
   Even as I speak, our warriors are fighting for us and for our country far away from their homes. I am proud that my stepson and my daughter-in-law are two of those warriors who served in Iraq and Lindsey in Afghanistan as well. 
   We pray for the success of all of our personnel in harm's way, knowing that victory will not be achieved in one decisive battle but in many small ones and fought in many ways and in many places around the globe. 
   Let us remember this as we prepare our defenses and make our plans to seek out and destroy those who would destroy us. 
   We must not deceive ourselves with the hope that this threat will just go away, that our enemies will tire of the battle, that they will experience a change of heart, and that they will renounce the evil that they have committed, and instead, we know that they will eagerly plan to do so again. 
   We must remember that we cannot hide, that we must not fall prey to the easy belief that there are easy solutions because, in fact, there are none. 
   But there is no room for despair, Madam Speaker. For more than two centuries, our country has risen to meet the challenges that at the time seemed impossible, when the odds against us seemed to be too great, and the path to victory seemed difficult to see. But we have always prevailed. 
   So on this day of remembrance, Madam Speaker, let us reflect upon all those whom we have lost, on all those who guard us still today, and on the task remaining for all of us, and pledge to do our duty as have all the generations that have preceded us. 
   God bless the United States of America, now and always. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Maggie Rodriguez, who recently accepted the lead anchor role on the nationally televised CBS ``Saturday Early Show.'' Maggie has been covering south Florida with CBS's local affiliate, CBS 4, for 7 years. As a news anchor on the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, Maggie has delivered news to millions of people in my community on a regular basis since the year 2000. 
   Maggie is a product of south Florida who has distinguished herself in her chosen field of journalism. She attended Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, located in the heart of my congressional district. In 1991, she graduated from the University of Miami, my alma mater. As a fellow south Floridian, I am very proud to honor Maggie on her many achievements. She is moving to New York, but she will always be welcomed in her hometown. 
   Her husband, Michael, is the general manager of Telemundo's local affiliate in Miami. I am sure that Maggie will continue to spend significant time down home in south Florida. 
   Since beginning her career with Univision in 1991, Maggie's warm personality, coupled with her strong work  ethic, has made her very successful. She has delivered breaking news on a number of notable stories throughout the years. She has extensive experience covering natural disasters. Before taking over as news anchor on CBS 4, Maggie reported on earthquakes and mudslides with KABC in Los Angeles. With CBS 4, she has, unfortunately, covered numerous hurricanes. Like any newscaster in south Florida, the long hurricane season every year has kept Maggie busy. 
   When hurricanes hit our region, local newscasters play a pivotal role in helping residents prepare and recover from hurricane damage. Oftentimes, they provide around-the-clock coverage. Most recently, Maggie did outstanding work reporting on Hurricane Wilma which severely impacted our region in the year 2005. 
   Maggie will be moving to New York where she spent significant time reporting for CBS 4 in the aftermath of 9/11. Maggie was noticed by CBS executives for her coverage of this year's Super Bowl in Miami. This led to guest appearances on the ``Saturday Early Show'' and eventually to a full-time position on this program. 
   Maggie is a great role model also for Hispanic girls in our community. She received the Young Hispanic Leadership Award from the Hispanic Heritage Council for both her professional accomplishments as well as her efforts in strong community service. 
   As a local news anchor, she has become an active member of our community, lending a helping hand to those in need. Her professional portfolio has garnered several awards, including six Emmys, along with two Edward R. Murrow awards. 
   She will be missed by so many people who tune in every afternoon and evening to watch her on CBS 4. However, we look forward to watching her on Saturday mornings nationwide. Her pleasant personality makes her ideal for this new role. 
   Once again, I congratulate Maggie Rodriguez as she begins this new chapter in her life. She truly deserves the recognition she has received, and now millions of Americans across the country will have the opportunity to watch her on Saturday morning. 
   Godspeed, Maggie.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, but with great reservations that this weak legislation will send a message to our enemies of a weakened U.S. position on the issue of Iran. 
   The Iranian threat to the United States, to our allies and to our interests could not be more apparent. Only last week the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that Iran is probably carrying out secret nuclear activities. Then last Saturday the lead inspector for the Middle East shared with member nations of the IAEA extensive documentation of an Iranian effort to reconfigure the Shahab-3 long-range missile to carry a nuclear warhead. The range of these missiles reach Israel and most of the Middle East. 
   And this is a regime whose current leader, Ahmadinejad, has consistently called for the destruction of the Jewish State of Israel. 
   On October 26, 2005, at the World Without Zionism Conference in Tehran, the Iranian leader called for Israel to be ``wiped off the map,'' described Israel as ``a disgraceful blot on the face of the Islamic world'' and declared that ``anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.'' Then on December 12, 2006, he addressed a conference in Tehran questioning the historical veracity of the Holocaust and said that Israel, again, would ``soon be wiped out.'' 
   On Israel's 60th birthday, Ahmadinejad gave a speech in which, according to the official Iranian news agency, he stated that Israel was ``on its way to total destruction.'' 
   In a public address which aired on the Iranian news channel on June 2 of this year, Ahmadinejad again called this ``worm of corruption'' in reference to Israel, to be wiped off. He further stated that while ``some say the ideal of Greater Israel has expired, I say the idea of lesser Israel has expired too.'' And earlier this week at the United Nations, he continued to invoke anti-Israel and anti-Semitic canards when he stated ``the dignity, integrity and rights of the European and American people are being played with by a small but deceitful number of people call Zionists. These nations are spending their dignity and resources on the crimes and the occupations and the threats of the Zionist network against their will.'' 
   But the threat is not just to our friend Israel. Iran is currently working on even longer-range missiles directly threatening critical U.S. interests. The importance and the urgency of strengthened sanctions was underlined just a few days ago, Mr. Speaker, when the European Union warned that Iran was approaching a nuclear weapons capability. The significance stems from the fact that the European Union has long insisted that the West and other countries focus their efforts on diplomacy to persuade Iran to suspend its nuclear program. 
   This is an acknowledgment that a strategy based on holding out an olive branch and engaging directly with the Iranian regime, while promising trade agreements and other benefits, has not worked and that more concrete economic pressure is needed to compel a change in regimes' behavior. Thus the evidence before us makes it clear that we must act quickly to impose the greatest pressure possible on the regime and its enablers. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does not do quite that, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues, you all know where I stand on Iran. Last Congress I authored the Iran Freedom Support Act which contained very tough and quite focused sanctions on the regime in Tehran. Our beloved late former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Lantos, was the lead Democrat cosponsor, and the bill enjoyed the support of our current chairman, HOWARD BERMAN, my good friend, and 360 Members of the House. 
   The Iran Freedom Support Act was enacted into law 2 years ago almost to the day on September 30. Then when Chairman Lantos approached me last year and asked that I serve as the lead Republican cosponsor of H.R. 1400, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007, I immediately agreed because H.R. 1400 truly does strengthen U.S. law and does tighten the economic noose around the regime's elites in Iran. 
   H.R. 1400 passed the House a year ago yesterday, September 25, 2007, by a vote of 397 in favor and only 16 against. Yet it has been stalled in the Senate all this time. Then we have Senate bill 970 which currently has the support of 73 Senators. However, action on these stronger bills was not to be. Instead, we have a bill which refers to certain sanctions already in place, and they call them ``new'' sanctions, and then refers to a handful of other important ones while providing a meager ``national interest waiver.'' 
   What does this mean in practice, Mr. Speaker? The next President doesn't have to worry about actually implementing or applying these sanctions, as a ``national interest waiver'' has been easily justified by consecutive administrations to avoid implementing U.S. laws concerning state sponsors of terrorism, like Iran. 
   So rather than strengthening the sanctions structure, rather than limiting the President's flexibility, as we did 2 years ago in the Iran Freedom Support Act on proliferation-related sanctions by removing the waiver and on the Iran Sanctions Act by raising the threshold to ``vital to the national security interests of the United States,'' the bill before us provides the weakest possible threshold. 
   I do not fault my good friend, Chairman Berman. I commend the chairman for his efforts. He is in a difficult situation, and this is as strong a bill as some of his colleagues will allow the House or the Senate to act on. 
   This bill is like one of the weak Iran resolutions that the United Nations Security Council keeps passing that allows Russia and China and others to go along with because they do nothing. In fact, just today, the U.N. Security Council moved a measure that contained no new sanctions but said that other Security Council resolutions on Iran are legally binding and must be carried out. That is almost exactly what the bill before us is going to do on the issue of sanctions. 
   Again, I do not understand why, at a time when the Iranian regime is crystal clear in accelerating its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon, that we are not considering the Lantos Iran Counter-Proliferation Act or Senate bill 970. 
   Notably, this body has not even considered the Ackerman-Pence resolution, which has 275 cosponsors and is a strong, unequivocal message to the regime. 
   Yet, Mr. Speaker, despite the many deficiencies of this bill, I want to thank my friend, Chairman Berman, for adding a Rule of Construction to his version of the Dodd bill which states, ``nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting in any way any provision of the Iran Freedom Support Act of 2006, Public Law 109-293.'' 
   Since the legislation retains a ``notwithstanding'' clause for section 103, I hope that the Rule of Construction will be sufficient to prevent the unraveling  of sanctions codified 2 years ago. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, portions of section 104 are essentially a repetition of current law as section 2(f) of the Executive Order 13059 codified. 
   In this respect, Chairman Berman, I would appreciate or his substitute, Mr. Ackerman, clarification that the waiver in section 104 would not apply to sanctions already in place, even if these have been restated in the legislation. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the reporting requirements have been strengthened with respect to investments in Iran's energy sector since January 1 of this year. However, I ask to add language to the bill before us that would amend current law and force a determination on whether foreign investments in Iran's energy sector violate the Iran Sanctions Act and whether sanctions should be implemented. My proposal was not limited to the last 9 months of activity or to simply reporting requirements. But this modification was not incorporated in the text that we are considering today. 
   Looking to other sections of this House version of the Dodd bill, there are provisions seeking to prevent the export or trans-shipment of U.S.-origin goods to Iran. Except for the language calling for the designation of a country as a Destination of Possible Diversion Concern, this bill duplicates most existing laws and regulations on these issues, as well as current U.S. Government programs. It does provide for the application of licensing controls to the countries designated, but immediately affords yet another mere ``national interest waiver.'' 
   There are also stronger bills pending on the issue of trans-shipment, such as H.R. 6178, the Security Through Termination of Proliferation Act, or the STOP Act. And I hope that we can work together to move that legislation in the next Congress. 
   My good friend, Howard Berman, shares with me concerns about trans-shipment and diversion of sensitive materials and technology to Iran. We articulated them in our letter of February 5, 2008, a letter to Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, raising these and many other vital issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, also on this issue I recently wrote to my chairman, HOWARD BERMAN, asking for greater scrutiny of foreign military financing, foreign military sales and direct commercial sales to countries that are a trans-shipment concern for U.S.-origin goods to Iran. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, despite my grave, serious and repeated reservations about this weak bill, I will vote for it, and I hope that the Iranian regime and its enablers do not see this as a sign of weakness on our part.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (COMPREHENSIVE IRAN SANCTIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to point out that the reports that we are getting about the threat of a nuclear-powered Iran are coming from all corners of the world, and I would like to read just segments of the online edition of The Jerusalem Post posted by Herb Keinon. It says, ``Military Intelligence: Iran Halfway to First Nuclear Bomb.'' It reads, ``Iran is halfway to a nuclear bomb, and Hezbollah, Hamas and Syria are using this period of relative calm to significantly rearm.'' 
   This is according to the Head of Research from the Israeli Military Intelligence, and that is the information that he gave and he shared with members of the Israeli Cabinet and the Israeli Parliament on September 21st, in the Knesset. He said there was a growing gap between Iran's progress on the nuclear front and the determination of the West to stop it. A growing gap. Iran gets closer, our determination is stopped. Iran is concentrating on uranium enrichment and is making progress.     
   He noted that they have improved the function of their 4,000 centrifuges. According to this military intelligence head of research, Iranian centrifuges have so far produced between one-third to one-half of the enriched material that is needed to build a nuclear bomb. The time that they will have crossed the nuclear point of no return is fast approaching. 
   Although he stopped short of giving a firm deadline, last week in the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he put the date at 2011. Tick tock, the clock is ticking. He said that their confidence is growing with the thought that the international community is not strong enough to stop them. He said that the Iranians were playing for time and that time was working in their favor because the longer the process dragged on, the wider the riffs appearing among the countries in the west, then Iran is in control of the technology and continues to move forward with determination toward a nuclear bomb. 
   In addition to their nuclear efforts, Iranians were also deepening their influence throughout the region, because they are cooperating with Syria. They are cooperating with the Palestinian terrorist organization, as well as being the main arms supplier to another terrorist group, Hezbollah. 
   While I appreciate the intentions of my good friend, Chairman Berman, this bill does fall far short of the type of comprehensive sanctions that would truly cripple the Iranian economy, which is dependent on investments in its energy sector. Setting aside the weakness of the bill regarding the U.S. direct sanctions on the regime, it does nothing tangible to force the executive branch's hand to fully implement the Iran Sanctions Act. 
   It could have, but language to include an automatic trigger for a determination of sanctions was not in place in this bill, and it was not to be. This bill had great promise. It does deliver on some of those promises. I wish that it could have gone further, but I hope that my colleagues will adopt this important bill tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill to approve the U.S.-India Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation. I've been a strong supporter of this increased cooperation between the United States and India, including peaceful nuclear cooperation. 
   I was an original cosponsor of the Henry Hyde U.S.-India Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Act, which laid the foundation for the agreement that we are seeking to implement this week. I have worked hard to secure bipartisan support for that legislation and for the agreement on nuclear cooperation. 
   To ensure that legislation bringing the nuclear agreement into force could be adopted by the Congress this week, I introduced, with the support of our Republican leadership, H.R. 7039, which is an identical version of the text now before the Senate and the text that Chairman Howard Berman introduced last night and that we are considering right now. 
   Mr. Speaker, the U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement is not one that we would offer to just any nation. It is a venture we would enter into only with our most trusted democratic allies. I believe that stronger economic, scientific, diplomatic, and military cooperation between the United States and India is in the national interest of  both countries and that our increasingly close relationship will be the central factor determining the course of global events in this century. 
   Among the most important elements of this new relationship is India's commitment to cooperate with the United States on major issues such as stopping the spread of nuclear weapons material and technology to groups and to countries of concern. 
   In particular, Mr. Speaker, this nuclear cooperation agreement is essential in continuing to ensure India's active involvement in dissuading, isolating and, if necessary, sanctioning and containing Iran for its efforts to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapon capabilities and the means to deliver these deadly weapons. 
   It will also help secure India's full participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative, including a formal commitment to the Statement of Interdiction Principles, and it will be a major step forward in achieving a moratorium by India, Pakistan and China on the production of fissile materials for nuclear explosives. 
   In addition, in order to meet the requirements of the Hyde Act, India and the International Atomic Energy Agency have negotiated a safeguards agreement on several Indian nuclear facilities that will expand the ability of the IAEA to monitor nuclear activities in that country. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are but a few of the many benefits from our nuclear cooperation with India and the strategic cooperation between our two countries that have already taken root. I am gratified that we are finally considering this legislation so that Congress can approve it without delay. 
   I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to approve this nuclear cooperation agreement with India overwhelmingly. By doing so, the United States and India will embrace one another in a strategic partnership that will prove to be one of the most principal guarantors of the security and prosperity of both countries in this new century. 
   I reserve the balance of our time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend my good friend, Rabbi Fred Klein, for his uplifting prayer that he delivered for us this morning, as well as for his tireless efforts to strengthen the Jewish community in my home district of South Florida. 
   Rabbi Klein serves as the Director of Community Chaplaincy at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and is the Executive Vice President of the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami. In these roles, Rabbi Klein offers counsel to the physically and mentally ill in their greatest times of need. 
   I have long been aware of Rabbi Klein's commitment and contributions  to academia, to the Jewish community, and the social welfare of all of South Florida. But his greatest achievement, Mr. Speaker, is his family, including his four children, Moshe who is 11, Shuli who is 9, Benny is 6 years old, and Aryeh almost 4. 
   The opening prayer that Rabbi Klein delivered today reflects his intellectual fiber, as well as his determination to improve our community and our country. I thank Rabbi Klein for his invocation, and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 196, which expresses the support of this House for the goals and ideals associated with World Water Day. 
   The lack of access to safe drinking water and the lack of adequate sanitation systems continue to be major problems for poor people around the world despite our strong efforts over many decades to help address those challenges. The lack of clean water and sanitation systems in many parts of the world lead to the spread of disease and to the deaths that might otherwise have been avoided and undermines the efforts we take to assist poor people around the world as they seek a better life. 
   Madam Speaker, I just got back last week from a heart-wrenching trip to Darfur, and we saw firsthand how important a resource water is to so many people. We saw, by visiting the clinics, how many people are afflicted with the diseases that are borne because of the water that is not pure, that is not sanitized and that is, in fact, full of bacteria. I understand how important it is to support the goals and ideals of this resolution before us commemorating World Water Day. 
   In addition to sanitation and access to clean water, the conservation of water resources is, itself, an increasing challenge around the world. Conservation of drinking water will, in fact, remain even a greater challenge in the near future as mankind's population continues to expand and the demand for fresh, clean water increases. 
   In calling for the appropriate Departments and agencies of the United States Government to increase our efforts to support access to clean water, availability of sanitation systems and conservation of water, this resolution properly cites the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 enacted in the last Congress, which called for a greater focus on the objectives that are associated with World Water Day. 
   This resolution rightfully seeks to highlight this global problem encouraging all of us to observe World Water Day every year on March 22. I support the intent of this resolution and its adoption by this House.  
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 100, authored by the esteemed Chair of our Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos). And this resolution, Madam Speaker, condemns the Government of Zimbabwe for its latest assault against political freedom and human rights in that country. 
   Once hailed by some as a liberator, President Mugabe of Zimbabwe has been exposed as a tyrant and a thug. 
   Under his authoritarian rule, Zimbabwe boasts the highest rate of inflation in the world, currently standing at an estimated 3,000 percent. Formal sector unemployment stands at 80 percent. Literacy rates are declining, and life expectancy has plummeted to 38 years. Thirty-eight years is the life expectancy in that country. 
   Large scale commercial farming has been effectively destroyed by a disastrous land reform program which ultimately displaced poor black farmers in favor of political cronies, and acute food shortages which have since left Zimbabweans dependent on international food aid. 
   The very same party that emerged from a hard-fought struggle for majority rule, shouting slogans of equality and justice, has now taken to arresting, to beating and to intimidating anyone who dares to challenge its policies. 
   It is clear that, absent meaningful corrective measures, Mugabe's legacy will be defined by his responsibility for the ruinous policies and draconian laws that have brought untold suffering to his people and the near collapse of Zimbabwe as a nation. 
   Rather than address the underlying inequities that have driven Zimbabwe to economic and political ruin, Mugabe prefers to engage in soapbox demagoguery and espouse conspiracy theories of Western imperialism. 
   He interferes with the work of nongovernmental organizations that are attempting to aid Zimbabweans in need. He harasses, he threatens foreign diplomats, and he even revokes the visas of congressional staffers from our Foreign Affairs Committee attempting to travel to the region to get a clear understanding of what is happening in Zimbabwe. 
   Mugabe thumbs his nose at Western nations that condemn his assault on basic human rights, particularly those who appear committed to helping Zimbabwe realize its potential through true democratic reform. 
   Zimbabwe's neighbors and the African Union should take proactive measures to help resolve this crisis, including by pressing the Mugabe regime to immediately halt its brutal crackdown, to release political prisoners, and to engage in meaningful dialogue with the opposition and with civil society. 
   The President of Zambia already has stepped up to the plate in this regard, and South Africa would be well advised to follow suit. 
   I thank the gentleman from California again, our chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee, for introducing this very important and timely resolution. And I urge the full support of our House. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as always, it is a delight and a joy to work with our chairman, TOM LANTOS of California. And I join him as an original co-sponsor of The American Red Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007. 
   The American Red Cross, as Mr. Lantos has pointed out, is an institution with a unique status. It has been assigned the responsibility by Congress of fulfilling the obligations of the United States under the Geneva Convention for carrying out peacetime and disaster relief functions. This obligation has not been a small undertaking. The Red Cross has been helping victims of war and natural disasters since its founding in 1881. 
   As a Member of Congress from Florida's 18th District, I am well aware of the great job, the amazing efforts of Red Cross as an organization made up of volunteers, and in the way that they have responded to numerous hurricanes in my State and tropical storms. And so on behalf of the residents of my district and my State, thank you to the Red Cross and its many volunteers. 
   And it is precisely because of this, Madam Speaker, I applaud the Red Cross for the hard work that it has done to review its internal governance structures and proposed changes to its charter that will make it an even stronger organization so they can help more people that will reform the organization and take it into its next century of service. 
   I am pleased that the Red Cross was willing to accept additional significant proposed changes that will provide even more accountability and transparency in the manner in which it will report its findings regarding audits and investigations to the general public. 
   In the future, Madam Speaker, anyone will be able to log on to the Red Cross Web site and view the results of its finding for audits and investigations that are conducted by the ombudsman's office. This act alone will provide even further assurances necessary for the American public to feel confident that the Red Cross handles donations with the utmost care. 
   I urge my colleagues to unanimously support H.R. 1681. And I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 185 regarding the creation of refugee populations in the Middle East, north Africa, and the Persian Gulf region resulting from human rights violations. 
   Discussions of Middle Eastern refugees invariably focus exclusively and short-sightedly on the plight of those of Palestinian descent. Few are aware of the injustices faced by hundreds of thousands of Jews, Christians and others who fled from Arab lands and Iran either as a direct result of the Arab-Israeli conflict or from persecution associated with that conflict. 
   Perhaps the most telling example, Madam Speaker, is the case of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands. Many Jews saw their communities, which had existed vibrantly for centuries even before the advent of Islam, systematically dismantled. Their populations throughout the Arab world and Iran was reduced from over 1 million to just several thousand. They lost their resources, their homes, and their heritage sites fleeing in the face of persecution, pogroms and brutal dictatorships. 
   Jewish refugees who fled Arab countries and Iran left behind what today amounts to billions of dollars in assets. Not only have they received not one thin dime of compensation to this day, but their plight has not even received recognition by the United Nations nor similar international institutions. 
   While countless U.N. resolutions have been adopted focusing on the Palestinian refugee issue, no conferences have been held on the Jewish refugees. No U.N. agencies nor international human rights organizations address their fate. Failure to recognize their plight, Madam Speaker, along with the plight of the Christian communities throughout the region, only serves to perpetuate their suffering. Therefore, in past Congresses, I have sponsored resolutions similar to the one before us today, House Resolution 185. This resolution urges greater recognition of the plight of these often overlooked refugees, it emphasizes that any comprehensive Middle East peace agreement can only be credible, can only be enduring if it resolves all issues related to the rights of all refugees in the Arab world and Iran, including Jews, Christians and others.  
   I am proud to be the lead Republican cosponsor of this resolution. And I thank my good friend and my colleague from New York, Congressman JERRY NADLER, for having the insight to introduce it. 
   I urge the House to adopt this very important resolution. 
   And with that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ALEXANDER LITVINENKO -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 154, which I introduced. 
   The purposes of this measure, they're very straightforward. First, it is to put this Congress on record as being skeptical, to say the least, about the Russian Government's views and positions regarding the murder of the Russian dissident and writer Alexander Litvinenko in November of 2006. 
   We must keep in mind that Litvinenko, as a former agent of the Russian Security Service, was in a position to speak with credibility when he charged high level officials of the Russian Government with involvement in assassinations and organized crime and the use of state-sponsored terrorism for political purposes in the 1999 bombings of several Russian apartment buildings. 
   We note that Mr. Litvinenko's poisoning with the radioactive material known as Polonium-210 raises some interesting general facts. Polonium-210 is not produced, nor commercially exported to Britain where Mr. Litvinenko was murdered. Indeed, as Mr. Berman pointed out, 97 percent of the world's production of Polonium-210 takes place in Russia. And indeed, after the poisoning of Litvinenko in London, British investigators were able to track traces of the material to passenger aircraft serving the London to Moscow route. 
   Furthermore, the British investigation into the murder has found that Litvinenko had met with three visitors from Russia prior to the detection of the radioactive poison in his body. The British authorities are now, in fact,  seeking to prosecute a Russian citizen who currently resides in Russia for his involvement in the murder. 
   The second purpose of this measure, Madam Speaker, is to point out that Polonium-210 would prove to be a dangerous weapon that Islamic radicals could use seeking to inflict large numbers of civilian casualties, not just to murder an individual. Therefore, as the dominant producer of this material, it is incumbent upon the Russian Government to ensure the security from proliferation of the Polonium-210, and this resolution indeed makes that case. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, I note that former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared before our Foreign Affairs Committee last October and said the following when asked about this case, and I quote. ``Many of the people running Russia today come from Security Services, the secret police. There has been a long and unbroken tradition of the use of murder as a means of controlling Russian society. And I can tell you that our British colleagues believe that they have at least a prosecutable case that goes very, very close to the seat of power in Moscow.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the perpetrators of the 1999 apartment building bombings in Russia probably hope that the passage of time would cover their tracks and that people would forget and move on. That appears to be the case in Moscow with this case as well, unfortunately. 
   So the question before our President and this Congress is the following: Will that be allowed to happen in the Litvinenko case as well? 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to keep in mind that the people of Russia live with this kind of threat every day. Their government is aggressively working to take back control over the economy, over their livelihoods, their access to uncensored news and their personal freedoms. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I hope that the House passes this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   The strongest argument that can be made for the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement is not that it is good for Colombia but that it is good for us. The U.S. has few barriers to trade, so currently most of Colombia's exports enter the U.S. with few or no restrictions. But Colombia has many barriers to our goods. This is what opponents of the agreement can't seem to grasp: The Free Trade Agreement will remove Colombia's barriers to U.S. goods. Of course Colombia will benefit economically but we will benefit more. 
   The second strongest argument is that our friends and enemies in this hemisphere are watching how we treat a loyal ally that is being threatened from many sides. If we do not pass this agreement, Mr. Speaker, and it is clearly in our interest to do so, the only possible conclusion that these countries can come to is that we made a deliberate choice to back away from an ally at this most crucial and critical time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate should be more about how this agreement will impact in a positive way our U.S. economy. An honest debate can have only one outcome--strong support for passage of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement and as soon as possible. 
   The capital of Colombia is only 3 hours away from my district in Miami, Florida. The strong ties that have developed between our communities are symbolic of the enduring friendship that our Nation shares with Colombia. As Florida's seventh largest global trading partner, passage of the FTA has the potential to boost Florida's exports to Colombia by $161 million in just the first year. Also significant is the agreement's ability to support the creation of nearly 5,000 new jobs throughout the State within the first 3 years of its passage. The positive impact that this FTA could have for the prosperity and security of our two nations, and indeed the hemisphere as a whole, cannot be denied. Serving as the steadfast bulwark against radical, anti-American regimes throughout the region, Colombia has proven time and time again its commitment to respecting human rights and democracy. 
   Now it is time for us to step up, Mr. Speaker, and not only support Colombia's efforts but provide Americans here at home the opportunity to benefit from our trade relationship as well. We hope that this trade agreement will be before us as rapidly as possible.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 997, which expresses the strong support of the House of Representatives for the NATO Alliance decision to enter into a Membership Action Plan, or MAP, with the countries of Georgia and Ukraine. 
   NATO has expanded its membership and its partnerships across Europe in recent years, making the Alliance not just stronger but an instrument for spreading democratic values. 
   The MAP process was created in 1999 to help those countries aspiring to join NATO to prepare to become members by providing guidance and practical support. The decision to admit a country into the MAP process is a serious one, exceeded only by the decision to admit a country into the Alliance. Countries need to demonstrate that they are sincerely consolidating their democracy, that they are willing to take on the requirements of the MAP process, and that they are willing to participate in missions that go beyond their own borders and direct interests.  
   Looking at Georgia and Ukraine, Madam Speaker, we recognize that these two countries have made important progress in introducing the systems and the institutions that support democracy. Democratic changes in these two countries have certainly not been easy, and at times the progress of democracy has been confused and uncertain. 
   Under very difficult circumstances and in the midst of wrenching changing times since they gained their independence, both Ukraine and Georgia have moved ahead with their political reforms, with their democratic institutions of governance, and the conduct of elections. The steps taken by these two countries compare favorably with trends in several nearby states, such as Russia, where true democracy is being steadily and comprehensively suppressed. 
   Both Georgia and Ukraine have also made great strides in the reform of their defense forces and in the commitment of their forces to peacekeeping and multilateral missions in other regions. Georgia is currently participating in NATO's Partnership For Peace program, and has successfully graduated from the Georgia Train and Equip program in 2004, after achieving its goals of enhancing its military capabilities and implementing military reforms. Georgia currently has 2,000 troops in Iraq, making it the third largest contributor after the United States and Britain. Furthermore, Georgia has troops in Kosovo, and has signed a transit agreement with NATO which allows the Alliance, as well as other nations participating in the International Security Assistance Force, to send supplies to their forces in Afghanistan through Georgian territory. Moreover, yesterday a Georgian defense ministry source said that Georgia is offering to send 500 troops to join NATO operations in Afghanistan. 
   Ukraine is also a member of the Partnership for Peace program, and currently has troops in Kosovo. Additionally, Ukraine has significantly contributed to multiple U.N. peacekeeping operations, including those in Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
   A stronger relationship with NATO should enable Ukraine and Georgia to move forward with their military reforms, prepare to commit to future peacekeeping and stability operations, and, more importantly, Madam Speaker, to consolidate the democracy that they are both seeking. 
   We understand that access to NATO's Membership Access Plan is not NATO's membership. If Ukraine and Georgia become part of MAP and seek NATO membership in the future, their candidacy will have to be carefully evaluated to make sure that they fully meet NATO's standards and will benefit the Alliance should they become full members. NATO membership for these two countries is not an immediate prospect and is a question that will wait for future consideration. 
   I note with regret, however, the recent predictable statements by officials of the Russian government alleging that NATO is seeking to surround Russia. They have rattled the nuclear saber to some degree, hoping, I suspect, to intimidate Ukraine in the process. I can only contrast such attitudes and statements with the very laudable step that Ukraine took in 1994, when it relinquished the powerful nuclear arsenal it had inherited from the Soviet Union for the sake of stability in Europe. 
   The steps taken by Georgia to support the U.S. and NATO, again in the face of terrific and unwarranted pressure from Russia, also deserve our commendation and our gratitude. The resolution before us, Madam Speaker, makes it clear that the United States should take a leading role in supporting these two countries' interests in the Membership Action Plan. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution authored by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Hastings of Florida, a resolution that commemorates the first use of the name ``America'' by European map makers. 
   When Italian photographer and navigator Amerigo Vespucci, the merchant, explorer and cartographer, set sail on his first westward bound voyage across the Atlantic, probably in the year 1497, he did so in search of a faster trading route to China. But in the course of his travels, he set foot instead in what is now the continent of South America. 
   From widely published letters attributed to him at the time, Europeans first came to know of the vast continents of this new world, lands that would come to play such a dominant role in the history of the Old World during the next four centuries. 
   From these letters, Amerigo's destiny as a namesake for our home on the world maps that followed was assured. 
   This resolution of Mr. Hastings reminds us that no matter where we live in the northern or southern hemisphere, we are Americans, united by a common history. 
   I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Hastings) for offering this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the past 20 years, more than 3 million people have been internally displaced in Colombia, and each year 200,000 more are internally displaced. 
   This massive displacement is a little-known fact about the long and tragic conflict that goes on in Colombia. One of the goals of Plan Colombia was to help end the violence, violence from that conflict and, in turn, stop the ongoing displacement. Plan Colombia has, indeed, reduced the violence, and the numbers of newly displaced people are down. 
   For example, according to the Colombian Government, from the years 2002 through 2005, incidents of terrorism are down 63 percent; and for the same time frame, homicides are down 37 percent, along with an 80 percent decrease in kidnappings. 
   In turn, the number of displaced people is down 64 percent from a high of 424,193 in the year 2002 when our aid program of Plan Colombia started to kick in and to help the situation on the ground. Now things are much better. Seventy percent of these displaced people still suffer from food insecurities, from inadequate shelters, and limited health care facilities. 
   In 1997, the Government of Colombia passed legislation known as Law 387, to guarantee rights and assistance to its internally displaced population. Since then, the Government of Colombia has expanded its ability to assist internally displaced people, but the constitutional court of Colombia has called the government's efforts to meet the basic needs of internally displaced persons insufficient. This resolution commends the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Colombian Catholic Church, and the Coalition for Human Rights and Internal Displacement for their initiatives in declaring the Year of the Rights of the Internally Displaced People in Colombia. 
   It also encourages the Government of Colombia and international donor communities to prioritize the discussions of humanitarian assistance and internal displacement with the international donor community, especially within the context of the London-Cartagena Process, which set the scene for an international cooperation, in addition to guidelines and a mandate for working on bringing peace and stability finally to Colombia. 
   House Resolution 426 also calls on the United States to increase emergency humanitarian assistance and to assist Colombia's internally displaced people in rebuilding their lives in a dignified, safe and sustainable manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE NEW POWER-SHARING GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to take this opportunity to rise in strong support of House Resolution 482, expressing support for the new power-sharing arrangement for the government in Northern Ireland. 
   Madam Speaker, on May 8, longstanding enemies in the violent conflicts in Northern Ireland came together in a historic agreement to put down violence and instead sit together in Parliament. With the formation of a  new Northern Irish government based upon a power-sharing agreement between the unionists and the nationalists, an important component of the 1998 peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement has been fulfilled, and a further step forward toward a peaceful political settlement in the region has been taken. 
   Progress toward peace in Northern Ireland has been dangerously unsteady, and it gives us all hope that perhaps at long last the paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland have lost favor with the public and that people are now looking forward to a legitimate political party process that leads them into the future. 
   While tensions may not have been completely erased and the differences of opinion will no doubt persist, it is remarkable to contemplate that now, hopefully, such differences will play out in the political arena rather than in the arena of bombs and guns. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation rightfully commends the collaboration of former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, whose patience and perseverance through the years even in the face of great odds has resulted in this step forward in the peace process. Prime Minister Blair eloquently outlined his fondest hopes for Northern Ireland in a 2002 statement regarding the peace process where he stated: `` ..... enemies would become not just partners in progress but sit together in government'' and `` ..... paramilitaries who used to murder each other as a matter of routine would talk to each other and learn to live with each other.'' 
   The commitments of Mr. Blair, Mr. Ahern and others appears to have transformed those noble goals into doable outcomes. 
   Madam Speaker, we all hope for a Northern Ireland that is a safer place to live and that those benefits turn into a prosperous economy for all. These recent developments are positive steps forward, but there is still much work to be done. We should seek to encourage continuing momentum and goodwill and support the new power-sharing agreement in whatever way is appropriate and possible to do. 
   I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure to show our support for this new government and to express our hope that the people of Northern Ireland will at long last achieve their goal of peace. 
   Madam Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Gallegly, the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Europe.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 467, which condemns the decision by the leadership of the University and College Union of the United Kingdom to support a boycott of Israeli academia. 
   This is not the first time, Madam Speaker, that we have faced such a challenge from the fringes of this academic establishment. In fact, on May 29, 2006, the British National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education falsely accused Israel and the Government of Israel of practicing what they said was ``apartheid policies'' and adopted a resolution to boycott the faculty of Israel and its academic institutions that do not denounce these nonexistent policies. 
   A similar resolution in favor again of an academic boycott of Israel was passed by the British Association of University Teachers, AUT, in April 2005, and then rescinded 1 month later by a special council of the AUT. 
   Fortunately, Madam Speaker, mainstream academics within the United Kingdom and internationally rejected these tragic and derisive attempts to undermine the principles of academic freedom and the free State of Israel. 
   Make no mistake, Madam Speaker, Israel is the strongest ally of the United States and a true democratic partner in the Middle East, one which upholds the principles and values of academic freedoms. 
   The boycotting of Israeli academics only serves to demonize the State of Israel. Moreover, the boycott of academic institutions from democratic countries represents a dangerous assault on the principles of academic freedom and open exchanges. 
   Representatives of the British Government, as well as many university presidents, academic bodies and leading scholars in the United States and Great Britain, have repeatedly spoken out against such campaigns. 
   I especially wish to highlight the strong voice of support from Donna Shalala, the President of the University of Miami in my congressional district, in favor of this resolution. Let us aid the efforts of these distinguished scholars and officials by passing this critical resolution before us tonight and demonstrating to the world that the United States Congress believes in free minds and free countries. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend my distinguished colleagues and friends, Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania and Mr. Burton of Indiana, for introducing this important resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (OPPOSING EFFORTS BY NATURAL GAS EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH A CARTEL -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, for several decades, the world's supply of petroleum has been held hostage to the whims of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also known as OPEC. 
   Over the past decades, OPEC has manipulated production to bring about enormous price increases. It has repeatedly manufactured energy crises and imposed embargoes against individual countries for political purposes, including right here in the United States. As a result of its policies, several of its members, and especially their elites, have grown enormously wealthy at the expense of the global economy, which has suffered severe disruption and slower growth. 
   Envying the success of this greedy model, many of the world's exporters of natural gas have begun taking steps to create a similar cartel in natural gas which has been termed as a ``gas OPEC.'' 
   There are some in the West who dismiss the feasibility of a new OPEC for natural gas, citing differences in the structure of the oil and gas industries. However, Madam Speaker, the leaders of many of these gas-exporting countries do not share those doubts, and several have been publicly enthusiastic about the prospects of this new project. 
   In January of this year, the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, proposed that Russia and Iran cooperate to establish a cartel for natural gas, prompting the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, to state his great interest in this project. And Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez has announced his eager support for the proposed cartel, which he describes as an expansion of his efforts to establish a similar structure in our own Western Hemisphere. 
   These are not empty statements. As the gas-exporting countries formed in Doha on April 9, 2007, a committee chaired by the Russian Government was established to study the proposals for greater coordination of policies, including pricing that participants confirmed would be necessary for the creation of such a cartel.     
   The threat is not only economic, but strategic. Officials from Iran have made clear their interest in using this gas OPEC as an instrument for political purposes. Russia has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to use its role as a supplier of oil and gas to exert political pressure on other countries, such as Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus, among others. 
   NATO officials have warned of the danger of Europe's increasing dependence on Russian energy. But plans by the Europeans to diversify their sources of supply with countries such as Algeria have been called into question as Moscow has actively courted these to secure greater coordination of policies, including pricing. 
   Beyond Europe, U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea, are heavily dependent on imported natural gas. Countries such as China and India are rapidly increasing their reliance on foreign suppliers. 
   Currently, the United States is largely self-sufficient in natural gas. However, we are projected to greatly increase our usage over the next decades, which could produce a growing reliance on world supply. 
   If we are to prevent the rise of this new threat, the United States must make clear to these governments who are contemplating the establishment of this new organization that we will regard the establishment of a natural gas cartel as prejudicial to our Nation's security and global security. 
   We must also develop a joint strategy with our allies and all countries that are importers of natural gas, including by diversifying sources and access to international markets, such as pipelines. 
   As we proceed, Madam Speaker, we must keep in mind that several gas-exporting countries, such as Canada, Trinidad and Qatar, are friends of the United States. We must seek to enlist their assistance in stopping this menace before it becomes a reality that, once established, may be with us forever. 
   The creation of a ``gas OPEC'' world constitutes a major new threat to the security and to the economic well-being of the United States, our allies and the world. We must not stand back and let yet another global extortion racket be established. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support, also, of H.R. 5834, the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act, which I introduced with my good friend from California, the chairman of our committee, Howard Berman, earlier this Congress. We passed this bill, Mr. Speaker, 4 months ago in a strong demonstration of this body's continued commitment to human rights, to transparent humanitarian assistance, and to refugee protection for the people of North Korea. 
   On Monday, the Senate followed our bipartisan lead and unanimously supported this bill with minor modifications, which is why we are taking it up again today. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar and their staffs for their input and their assistance. Special thanks to my friend, Senator Sam Brownback, for his long-standing leadership on the issues of North Korea human rights, and his efforts were instrumental in securing a successful outcome in the Senate.     
   During our initial House floor debate in May, Mr. Speaker, we discussed the dire traumas that the North Korean regime has perpetrated against its own people during the past half century. 
   Rather than recount the horrific circumstances which compelled me to draft this bill, I would instead like to focus today on some of the important clarifications contained in this legislation. 
   Over the past 4 years, in oversight hearings, in meetings and official letters, Members have expressed their dissatisfaction with the executive branch implementation of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. 
   In the words of the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee on this bill, it has been ``too slow and too weak,'' and the purposes set forth in section 4 of the original act remain largely unrealized. 
   After enactment, the administration delayed appointment of the special envoy for nearly 8 months, 4 months after the envoy was required to file a report to Congress under the act, a deadline that was ignored. Since then, the special envoy has never filled that position on more than a part-time basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Members were genuinely surprised by that limited time commitment, which did not track with the broad duties and responsibilities assigned to the envoy and the ambitious purposes of that law. Congress has also repeatedly noted our disappointment with the inadequate pace of the North Korean refugee admissions during the past 4 years. 
   Even though title 3 of the act clarified North Korean eligibility for U.S. resettlement and required the Secretary of State to facilitate the submission of those refugee applications, fewer than 70 of the more than 150,000 refugees resettled here since then have been North Koreans. 
   Many North Koreans have been deterred or have abandoned their claims for U.S. resettlement because of the extremely long wait caused by the resistance and the delay of foreign governments, as well as the slow pace of our own screening. 
   One poignant case, Mr. Speaker, followed by our committee staff involved the family of three North Koreans, a husband, a wife, and their young son. That family lived a vulnerable and depressing existence in Southeast Asia, confined largely to a single room for more than 2 years while awaiting completion of the U.S. process. Even though the mother was battling cancer, they persisted in the resettlement process because she believed that life in America would provide the most freedom and opportunity for her son. 
   This summer, after a personal appeal by Chairman Berman and me, they were finally allowed to leave that Third Country and travel halfway around the world to their new home in Virginia. After years of heroic patience, the mother lived just long enough to deliver her son safely to this land of new promise. She died less than 2 weeks after their arrival. 
   The United States must intensify our diplomacy with foreign nations on these issues, Mr. Speaker, and work more cooperatively with our ally South Korea, which admirably continues to bear the overwhelming bulk of the refugee resettlement numbers. 
   To help address these deficiencies, H.R. 5834 clarifies and strengthens the role of the special envoy. It makes the special envoy for North Korean human rights an ambassadorial-rank position to ensure that the envoy has ample stature to pursue his or her duties with foreign governments, as well as to promote the priorities of the act within the Department of State. 
   This bill makes clear that the envoy position is to be ``a full-time position ..... as intended by the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004.'' 
   When combined with the requirement of the original act that the envoy ``be a person of recognized distinction in the field of human rights,'' the bill before us eliminates any misconception that the position may be a part-time undertaking, or a second hat worn by a Foreign Service officer with other, more important, supposedly, duties. 
   This bill also makes clear that the envoy's mandated concerns include the protection of North Korean refugees. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill inserts a new paragraph at the very top of the special envoy's statutory duties that confirms the envoy's role in the formulation and implementation of the full  range of activities under the North Korean Human Rights Act, which includes, in the words of the act: ``Promoting the Human Rights of North Koreans''; ``Assisting North Koreans in Need''; and ``Protecting North Korean Refugees.'' 
   The people of North Korea face some of the most severe repression on the planet. 
   I am proud of the work that our Congress began 4 years ago to help their plight, and I thank my friend Chairman Berman, our bipartisan cosponsors, and the numerous nongovernmental organizations who have worked with us to extend and improve the North Korean Human Rights Act. 
   I urge unanimous support for this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I also rise in strong support of House Resolution 1402, a measure that underscores congressional support for democracy, development and respect for fundamental human rights in Bangladesh. I would like to congratulate my good friend from New York, Congressman Crowley, for his leadership on this resolution, and for his long-standing interest in Bangladesh and indeed all of South Asia. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States and Bangladesh have been strong allies since the founding of that country in 1971. Despite many handicaps, including a unique vulnerability to natural disasters, Bangladesh has made impressive strides in key areas of development during the 1990s. However, political polarization, endemic corruption  and the rise of violent extremists all pose serious challenges to Bangladesh society. 
   In January of 2007, faced with an opposition boycott of national elections and widespread political violence, Bangladesh's president declared a state of emergency. In accordance with the constitution of Bangladesh, the president appointed a caretaker government, which has in turn embarked on an ambitious agenda of reform and renewal for the people of Bangladesh and its institutions. 
   Since that time, the United States has consistently urged Bangladesh's caretaker government to lift the restrictions on basic rights, meet international standards for due process in pursuing corruption cases and follow through on its commitment to hold free, fair and transparent elections by December 2008.     
   In recent weeks, there have been positive indications that the electoral roadmap remains on track. The government's progress on updating their voter list and on fighting corruption are encouraging signs, as is its effort to move forward on dialogue with political parties. 
   Despite these positive developments, however, it remains the strong view of the Congress and the executive branch that the caretaker government must immediately lift the state of emergency or otherwise remove restrictions on freedoms of assembly and freedom of the press. 
   The political parties of Bangladesh must be able to participate fully in a democratic process. This resolution reaffirms the importance of a U.S. national interest in helping to work with the people of Bangladesh in building a peaceful, prosperous, democracy that will continue to be a strong partner for the United States. 
   I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The night of November 9 through November 10 of the year 1938 consisted of hours of darkness that the world cannot afford to forget. Known as Kristallnacht, that horrible night of unleashed terror and violence that we remember in this resolution before us today, was the clear signal for the start of Adolf Hitler's orchestrated campaign of genocide. 
   On that night, as state-sponsored violence poured out into the streets, the halls of civilized governments were mute. Joseph Goebbels had announced in his speech on the day of November 8, and I quote, ``The Fuhrer has decided that ..... demonstrations should not be prepared or organized by the Party, but insofar as they erupt spontaneously, they are not to be hampered.'' 
   Following that speech, regional leaders of Hitler's National Socialist Party issued instructions to their local offices, and violence erupted across Germany and in some neighboring countries as well, in a matter that was anything but spontaneous. For 48 terrible hours, mobs rampaged through the streets of German, Czechoslovak and Austrian cities. 
   The riots destroyed 267 synagogues, shattered an estimated 7,500 windows of Jewish-owned businesses and desecrated many Jewish cemeteries. The Night of Broken Glass claimed the lives of at least 91 Jewish citizens. 
   Unfortunately, the rest of the world remained largely silent when confronted with the news of this organized brutality. We can only wonder how history might have changed, how the war and the genocide of the subsequent years might have been avoided if silence had been replaced by condemnation and strong action. 
   As we look back at the events of that terrible night, from the perspective of the passage of 70 years, we recall what our president at that time, Franklin Roosevelt, said. ``I, myself, could scarcely believe that such things could occur in a 20th century civilization.'' 
   As we consider this resolution, which notes this terrible event 70 years ago and the subsequent organized murder of more than 6 million Jews across Europe during World War II, we realize how important it is that we remember the lessons of the 20th century today at the start of the 21st century. 
   I urge strong adoption of this important resolution, and I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1451 establishing the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, my friends Mr. McGovern and Mr. Wolf, the cochairs of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, who authored this fitting tribute to the late chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, our dear friend, Congressman Tom Lantos of California. 
   A quarter century ago, Tom Lantos was the founding cochair of the Human Rights Caucus. With the tireless assistance of his wife, his partner in life, Annette, Tom spent the remainder of his life at its helm, and it grew to become one of the largest and most active caucuses on the Hill. 
   It is a fitting tribute to his heroic life that we meet here today, Madam  Speaker, to upgrade the status of that organization and name it in Tom Lantos' honor. 
   Tom Lantos was born in Budapest in 1928, and came of age as Nazism descended upon the European continent. Imprisoned during the Second World War merely for being Jewish, Tom Lantos twice escaped the labor camps and survived the Holocaust with the help of the Hungarian resistance movement and the Swedish humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg. 
   Tragically, Tom's family was not so fortunate and they perished in the death camps alongside millions more. 
   Tom experienced human nature at its worst, and his later work as a champion of human rights cannot be separated from the trials that he endured as a young man. 
   The horrors of fascism helped to forge his unshakeable commitment to the protection of human dignity. It is hard to think of a major human rights issue of the past three decades on which Tom Lantos was not a leader, whether it was the fight against anti-Semitism, religious persecution, human trafficking, genocide in Darfur, or repression in Tibet, just to name a few. 
   The bill before us today will create the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission as the formal successor to the Human Rights Caucus. The new commission will carry on the nonpartisan work of promoting fundamental human rights both inside and outside Congress. It will be cochaired by a majority and minority member, and may be joined by any Member of the House. Although it does not have legislative responsibility nor oversight, the commission will be staffed by professionals from the Committee on Foreign Affairs which it is required to collaborate with closely. 
   I am thankful and blessed for the years that I was able to serve the people of our Nation alongside a hero like Tom Lantos. I appreciate the opportunity that this resolution gives us to honor his life and to recommit ourselves to the ideals by which he lived every day. 
   I look forward to many years of spirited advocacy by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, and I urge unanimous support for this important resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (REMEMBERING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UKRAINIAN FAMINE-GENOCIDE OF 1932-1933 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of House Resolution 1314, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian famine, Holodomor, of 1932 and 1933. 
   The former Communist state known as the Soviet Union was controlled by a brutal regime that oppressed its own people as well as that of its neighbors. The scars left by the inhumane practices and policies of the Soviet leadership are still felt, despite the passage of 75 years since the famine in Ukraine and the passage of almost two decades since the Soviet regime's demise. 
   During 1932 and 1933, Joseph Stalin's Communist regime intentionally confiscated grain harvest from the Ukrainian people and prevented any foreign food from being shipped in to help those who were starving to death.     
   The famine inflicted on Ukraine by the Stalinist regime during those years killed millions of Ukrainians. It is one of the most stark examples of the former Soviet regime's cruel and horrific policies. 
   Among other items, this resolution notes the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian famine and expresses sympathy to the victims, survivors and  families of that man-made calamity; condemns the violation of human rights, the freedom of speech and of the self-determination of the Ukrainian people by the former Soviet regime; encourages expanding the world's knowledge about this man-made disaster; and, lastly, supports continued efforts in Ukraine to strengthen the principles of democracy and of a free-market economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1461 which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the terrorist bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and honors those who were killed or injured as a result of these attacks. 
   I imagine there is not one among us here today that could not tell you exactly where they were or what they were doing when the al Qaeda terrorist network launched its cowardly and dastardly attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. 
   Many of us recounted those stories just 2 weeks ago as the House and the Senate united to solemnly commemorate the seventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks. And while September 11 represents the deadliest attacks suffered by the American people at the hands of the al Qaeda operation to date, it was not the first. 
   Three years earlier on the morning of August 7, 1998, 223 people were killed and 5,000 people were injured as nearly simultaneous car bombs ripped through the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings in Nairobi were particularly serious as the embassy stood on one of the busiest intersections in the city and the blast took down several neighboring buildings. The bombing in Tanzania was no less spectacular, but remarkably, it occurred on a national holiday when the embassy was closed. 
   Though these terrorist attacks reportedly were intended to punish the United States, the overwhelming majority of the victims that day were Kenyan and Tanzanian. This is typical of a network which callously views the innocent victims it kills, including fellow Muslims, merely as collateral damage. It also reveals the true hypocrisy of al Qaeda's radical Islamic agenda. 
   In all, 12 Americans were killed as a result of the east African embassy bombings, 31 foreign service nationals were killed, and one is still listed as missing. Scores more were saved as guards protecting the embassy in Nairobi succeeded in physically blocking the suicide bombers from gaining entry into the underground parking area. They paid with their lives for this act of heroism.  
   We owe a debt of gratitude to those who died in service to our country on August 7, 1998. And we are compelled to express our profound sorrow for those whose lives were taken or were forever altered as a result of these dastardly attacks. 
   As we solemnly commemorate the 10th anniversary of the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the seventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks on our Nation, we seek to reaffirm our resolve to defend our Nation, to defend our interests from radical Islamic terrorists who seek to destroy the United States and our citizens. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Scott, for introducing this important measure, and I urge unanimous support for its passage. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1369 recognizes the efforts of nongovernmental organizations working to bring just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.     
   I would like to thank my good friend from California, the gentlelady, Ms. Barbara Lee, for her hard work in drafting this important resolution. We all want to see peace, stability and security prevail in the Middle East and, indeed, in all regions of conflict. However, that goal remains elusive when leaders act in ways that distort, perpetuate and aggravate otherwise resolvable disputes between nations and peoples. Such leaders make peace impossible by programming their citizens into viewing other nations and other people as wicked, as inhuman, as worthy of hatred and even of death. 
   Fortunately, the work of nongovernmental organizations and of individuals committed to nonviolence and to Israel's right to exist as a Jewish and as a Democratic state provide a counterweight to the purveyors of this terrible rhetoric. These individuals and NGOs cultivate relationships that oppose violent extremism and hateful propaganda, that promote a culture, instead, of life and that seek peaceful, rational and mutually beneficial solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 
   So I commend the gentlelady from California (Ms. Lee) for its introduction, and I urge the passage of this important resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING CAMPAIGN BY ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE TO DIVERT UNITED DURBAN REVIEW CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1361--but, but, but, but, but with great reservations, particularly with respect to changes made to the text after the resolution had been adopted by our Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, in 2001, a number of anti-democratic governments hijacked the planning and implementation of the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban, South Africa. 
   Instead of representing a bold step forward by devoting its attention to fighting racism and other bigotry, the event was dominated by attacks on America, on Israel, and on Jews at every turn. 
   At the conference's NGO forum, groups distributed literature expressing sorrow that Adolf Hitler did not fully exterminate the Jewish people. The anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric at Durban so discredited the conference that our U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell, withdrew our delegation, stating, ``I know that you do not combat racism by conferences that produce declarations containing hateful language or that singles out any one country alone in the world, Israel, for censure and abuse.'' 
   Our late friend and colleague, Tom Lantos, the former Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also walked out on Durban, stating that the conference ``provided the world with a glimpse into the abyss of international hate, discrimination and, indeed, racism.'' 
   Today, Madam Speaker, we are confronted with the forthcoming 2009 Durban Review Conference, also known as Durban II. The version of this resolution that passed our committee was a compromise that was worked out between our Republican and Democratic Members. Having introduced several resolutions in this Congress addressing Durban II, I felt at the time that even that compromise text did not go far enough in portraying the problems plaguing this conference. That compromise text, however, focused on defeating the campaigns by some countries, particularly members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to divert Durban II away from reviewing human rights concerns and, instead, focus it on attacking Israel and promoting anti-Semitism. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the text before us today has a different focus. This text places the emphasis on higher level U.S. diplomatic efforts on ensuring that Durban II follows up on the commitments made at the last conference, an effort that could be interpreted as legitimizing the first Durban meeting, and as such the efforts by Israel and America haters. 
   Indeed, Madam Speaker, responsible nations must work to fight against racism and other forms of intolerance. And therefore, we appreciate that the 2001 Durban Declaration declared slavery to be a crime against humanity and  noted that the Holocaust should never be forgotten. 
   We all wish that Durban I were a symbol of success in the struggle against racism, and that Durban II would build on that success. However, Madam Speaker, the Durban Conference ultimately did not represent progress against racism. Until this very day, Durban is a symbol of the powerful, pervasive menace of anti-Semitism and anti-Israel hate. 
   Indeed, the conference's own Durban Declaration, which could have been a stirring, unequivocal call to stop racism and hate, was tarnished by a number of irrelevant provisions, including several clauses that singled out Israel while ignoring the plight of Israelis under siege from violent extremists. 
   Therefore, it is imperative that we not imply, in hindsight, that Durban I was more positive than it actually was; neither should we pretend that Durban II will be less disastrous than it actually will be. 
   The planning committee for Durban II, Madam Speaker, is led by the regimes of Libya, Iran and Cuba. And that committee has already expressed its intent to focus the conference on Israel bashing, anti-Semitism, and establishing a global blasphemy code that could stifle our freedom of speech and religion. 
   Just a few days ago, on September 19, the Algerian Ambassador to the U.N. Missions in Geneva, within the context of discussions concerning Durban II, redefined anti-Semitism and referred to ``traditional anti-Semitism'' as having become ``politically incorrect in many rich nations.'' What? Translation, Madam Speaker: Anti-Israel and anti-Semitism is objectionable in rich nations of the West, but acceptable everywhere else. 
   The fix is in, Madam Speaker. After extensive diplomatic efforts by the U.S. to prevent Durban II from following in the dark path of its predecessor, we joined our allies, Canada and Israel, in declaring that we will not fund and we will not participate in a conference that promotes hate. 
   As former Assistant Secretary of State Kristen Silverberg noted while testifying before our Foreign Affairs Subcommittee this past April, ``There is absolutely no case to be made for participating in something that is going to be a repeat of Durban I. We don't have any confidence that this will be any better than Durban I.'' 
   It is clear, Madam Speaker, that any further U.S. involvement in Durban II in the planning process, whether by an Undersecretary, by the Secretary of State, or even by the President, will not avert the looming train wreck that is Durban II. It will only waste precious U.S. time, legitimacy, and political capital on a doomed venture. 
   However, the text before us today, while it contains some positive clauses as it has been amended after committee action, could be misconstrued as urging America to further participate in the Durban II planning process in order to attempt to ensure that Durban II follows up on the commitments made at Durban I. 
   Making sure that we don't send a mixed signal is especially important this week, Madam Speaker, as the United Nations General Assembly meets in New York and as Ahmadinejad prepares today to spew his anti-American, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic venom on the world stage. 
   I will vote for this resolution, Madam Speaker, with the intent that it does not call for the U.S. to participate in Durban II or its planning process in any way, shape or form. Moreover, Madam Speaker, I will continue my efforts to work with my colleagues, the executive branch, and our allies to discuss an alternative to Durban, one rooted in freedom, in tolerance, and in democratic values. 
   I thank Chairman Howard Berman for introducing this resolution. I intend to vote for it with all of these reservations. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 374, which expresses the House's backing for interfaith dialogue between Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when violent extremists are misusing Islam in order to encourage others to commit mass murder and to do away with liberty, it is more important than ever for true moderates from all faiths to come together and to unequivocally repudiate hate and violence and to embrace peace, tolerance and religious freedom for all. 
   As true moderates do come together for this most noble of purpose, they should know that America stands with them in their quest. 
   Mr. Speaker, while this important resolution deals with interfaith dialogue involving adherence to Christianity, to Judaism and to Islam, I would like to note that interfaith dialogue and religious freedom should encompass all faiths. 
   Finally, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague and dear friend, Mr. Wamp of Tennessee, for introducing this important resolution and for presenting it before us today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5443, a bill to upgrade the status of South Korea's foreign military sales to that of the countries of NATO, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Howard Berman for helping to schedule consideration of this legislation before us today and to also recognize the important work of our Foreign Affairs colleague, Mr. Royce of California, in introducing this timely and important bill which I am pleased to cosponsor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill appropriately accords South Korea the same treatment provided to other key partners of the United States in the foreign military sales process, such as higher dollar thresholds and expedited time frames for congressional notifications. This upgrade is a powerful symbol of a renewed and transformed U.S.-South Korea alliance. It forcefully reaffirms that South Korea has been and will continue to be a close and valued strategic ally of the United States--a relationship that has long served as a bedrock of stability for northeast Asia. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is strongly supported by our Departments of State and Defense, and its passage will help advance a new strategic framework for the alliance but not only for the purpose of managing a range of increasingly complex contingencies related to North Korea, but also to cement a common Democratic partnership for the next century. 
   I urge its adoption. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6646, a bill to require the executive branch to provide quarterly briefings to Congress on possible defense transfers from the United States to Taiwan. 
   At the outset, I'd like to thank Chairman Howard Berman and the leadership on both sides for helping to expedite consideration of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a modest bill. It requires the executive branch again to regularly brief Congress on our policy toward Taiwan and, in particular, the defense needs of Taiwan and the security balance across the strait. 
   Why is this bill even necessary? Well, it's necessary because a long-rumored freeze on United States foreign military sales to Taiwan was confirmed on July 16 by Admiral Timothy Keating, the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific. 
   According to press accounts of his remarks at the Heritage Foundation, Admiral Keating observed that there have been ``no significant arms sales from the U.S. to Taiwan in relatively recent times,'' and that the absence of arms sales under the Foreign Military Sales process reflected ``administration policy.''     
   Admiral Keating went on to suggest that he had, in fact, discussed the issue of Taiwan arms sales with leaders in Beijing, noting that, ``The Chinese have made clear to me their concerns over any arms sales to Taiwan.'' 
   I found Admiral Keating's remarks at the Heritage Foundation affirming that there was, in fact, a ``freeze'' on arms sales to Taiwan to be a cause for great concern. Even more disturbing was the Admiral's indication that the Chinese leadership had had some input into the decision of the United States about Taiwan's defensive needs and our commitment to Taiwan under our laws. 
   The Taiwan Relations Act gives Congress a clear role in the provision of defensive weapons to Taiwan. President Reagan's ``Six Assurances'' to Taiwan was a solemn commitment made over a quarter century ago making it clear that there should be no pre-consultation with Beijing on this matter. However, it seems that, while Congress has been left in the dark on this issue--which is of vital concern to our national security interests--the Chinese leadership has been kept fully abreast of our Nation's intentions. 
   Last year, the House passed a resolution that I put forward which declared, ``It shall continue to be the policy of the United States, consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, to make available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may be necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' That remains my firm position. 
   The legitimate defense needs of our friends in Taiwan must be met no matter who attended the Beijing Olympics nor how helpful the State Department says that China has been in the talks with North Korea. That is the clear intention of the Taiwan Relations Act. That is the clear commitment that President Reagan gave to Taiwan. On this matter, Mr. Speaker, there can be no backsliding or compromise. 
   I hope and I trust that this bill can be passed swiftly prior to congressional adjournment and thereby alleviate some of the confusion over this so-called arms ``freeze.'' 
   For almost 30 years, the judicious sale of defensive weapons has been an essential element in the United States support for a secure, stable and democratic Taiwan as well as for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Now is not the time to backtrack from that historic and bipartisan policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress should do everything in its power to ensure that Taiwan will continue as a beacon of democracy shining its light directly across the strait in the very heart of Tiananmen Square. 
   I urge support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I also rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 371 which states the support of the Congress for just restitution or compensation for property illegally confiscated during the last century in certain countries of Eastern Europe. 
   The tragedy of the Holocaust, in which millions of innocent people were murdered by the Nazis and their property illegally confiscated, was followed by oppression and continued confiscation under Communist regimes. The fresh air of freedom that entered with the collapse of the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe moved some post-Communist governments in the region to support justice for the victims of such property confiscation. 
   Regrettably, as this resolution points out, the government of Poland has not enacted legislation that would provide for a process for the restitution of, and the compensation for, private property that had been seized, that had been confiscated illegally by those regimes.     
   Similarly, Lithuania has not implemented legislation that would provide for the restitution or compensation for communal property confiscated by the Nazi and Communist regimes. 
   This resolution calls on the Polish government to enact such legislation. It calls on the lithuanian government to implement legislation so that communal or religious properties can be returned to their rightful owners or can provide them or their heirs with fair compensation. 
   Madam Speaker, the resolution also calls on our President and our Secretary of State to engage the governments of Poland and Lithuania on these important issues. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1227, which condemns pervasive sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and calls upon responsible nations to take immediate steps to respond. 
   While many have focused well-deserved attention on the humanitarian and human rights crisis in Darfur, Sudan, scant attention has been given to a deadly, festering conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The war in Congo has been called Africa's first ``world war,'' having drawn in seven neighboring countries and spawning some of the worst human rights atrocities known to man. An estimated 4 million people were killed by war, disease and starvation. Armed groups engaged in systematic rape, looting and acts of cannibalism often forcing their victims to victimize others. Children were forcibly recruited to serve as soldiers, and civilians were used as human shields. 
   Though a 2002 peace agreement and elections in June 2006 paved the way for a new beginning in Congo, these atrocities have continued in the eastern part of the country where a proxy war for control over Congo's vast natural resources continues to rage. 
   The level of sexual violence in eastern Congo is particularly alarming. It has become so pervasive, Mr. Speaker, and so severe, that the Panzi Hospital in South Kivu has had to perform an estimated 3,500 surgeries annually to repair a particularly stigmatizing injury suffered by those who have been brutally raped. And that is just one hospital. Countless others suffer the physical injury and the social consequences of rape in silence living as outcasts in their own communities. 
   All parties to the conflict in eastern Congo have taken part in such human rights atrocities, including the armed forces of the Congo and an increasingly vast array of armed militias. Even the United Nations peacekeepers, who have been deployed to help protect civilians in Congo, have engaged in acts of sexual exploitation and abuse themselves. 
   This is an unspeakable and unforgivable crime that cannot be swept under the carpet. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mrs. Maloney of New York, for seeking to draw attention to the scourge of sexual violence in the eastern Congo and for seeking to inspire responsible nations to provide critically needed assistance to those in need. 
   I would like to thank the sponsor, Mrs. Maloney, as well as our chairman, Howard Berman, for agreeing to modifications which would allay fears raised regarding the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and what was referred to as ``women's reproductive health.'' 
   With these critical changes accepted, I urge support to House Resolution 1227, Mr. Speaker. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for House Concurrent Resolution 255, which deals with the preservation of the historic Jewish cemetery in Lithuania. I thank our colleague, Congressman Ferguson, for introducing this important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us speaks to the preservation of a historic Jewish cemetery located in Vilnius, Lithuania, a city that was once a major center of Jewish culture in all of Europe. That cemetery has been in existence since the 13th century and is considered by religious experts around the globe and those of the Jewish faith to be sacred ground. 
   In 2002, the Government of Lithuania entered into a bilateral agreement with the United States to ensure the protection and the preservation of certain historical, cultural and sacred properties, including cemeteries such as the one in Vilnius. Regrettably, despite that bilateral agreement, construction of a condominium building took place within the perceived boundaries of the Jewish cemetery in Lithuania. 
   The resolution before us expresses the view that the Jewish cemetery in Vilnius must not be desecrated. It urges the Lithuanian Government to protect the cemetery site from future construction and desecration. 
   I want to note at this point, Mr. Speaker, that Lithuania has indeed been our ally in NATO since 2004. Indeed, the United States and Lithuania have had a strong relationship. And I believe that bilateral cooperation on issues of importance such as this issue that is addressed by the measure before us today will strengthen that relationship. 
   This resolution simply calls on the Lithuanian Government to do more to protect and preserve this cemetery site. Such action by the Government of Lithuania would indeed reaffirm the values shared by our two nations, and in so doing, enhance the broader relationship between the United States and Lithuania. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the House is poised to vote on legislation that, if passed, will cripple our foreign policy for many years to come and place our troops and all American citizens in great danger. It is a bill that seeks to abandon the Iraqi people, that seeks to abandon our closest friends and allies in the Middle East, leaving them to fend for themselves against radical Islamic militant jihadists. It is a bill that provides a roadmap for the insurgents, giving them a detailed account of the benchmarks they need to focus on in order to ensure an American withdrawal from Iraq. 
   Regardless of victory or failure, this bill demands withdrawal from Iraq. It  demonstrates very little confidence in the ability of our troops to get the job done in Iraq and defeat the terrorists there. 
   My stepson Doug and my daughter-in-law Lindsey have served proudly as marine fighter pilots in Iraq, and Lindsey will soon head back to another tour of duty in Iraq. They do not believe that you can separate the soldier from the mission. They do not believe that we have an option to simply walk away. Doug and Lindsey and many others like them do not want Congress to add to the burdens and the dangers that they face by legislating restrictions, deadlines and arbitrary instructions that only benefit the enemy. 
   The obvious danger of this legislation has been demonstrated by the desperate measures that the majority has resorted to in order to overcome fierce resistance in their own caucus. An emergency war funding measure should not be used to pay for programs that benefit narrow, favored constituencies. 
   I doubt that this ambition by the majority to micromanage the war will be their last attempt. Are they envisioning assuming command and control of the positioning and movement of our troops; of setting daily targets for air strikes; of determining our negotiation strategy with allies and opponents?     
   Perhaps a war room should be set up outside this Chamber so that they can make it easier to offer instructions on the battlefield.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Payne for his words. I am also pleased to support House Resolution 98, highlighting the life and achievements of the late John Garang and reaffirming the commitment of the House to a just and lasting peace in Sudan. 
   While much attention is currently focused on the crisis in Darfur and that region of western Sudan, it is critical that we do not allow ourselves to become complacent in the south. After all, it was in the south that over 20 years of war between the government in Khartoum and the Sudan People's Liberation Army left over 2 million people dead and 4 million others displaced. It was in the south that the government of Sudan honed its craft in genocide, manipulating ethnic tensions, arming proxy militias, conducting aerial bombardments of civilians and engaging in forced displacement, mass murder, looting, torture and rape. It was also in the south that a generation of boys was lost, having been forcibly conscripted to serve as child soldiers for the Armed Forces of Sudan, associated militias and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. 
   Any analyst will tell you that war is a terrible business, and the war in Southern Sudan was no exception. There were no saints. That said, it is clear that without the leadership of Dr. Garang, it is likely that the oppressors would have succeeded and that the opportunity for peace presented by the conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan in 2005 would have been lost. 
   Dr. Garang envisioned a united democratic Sudan, a country in which all citizens enjoyed the freedom to live, to worship and to prosper without the fear of discrimination or persecution. If realized, this dream would proffer untold benefits, not only for the people of the south, but also for those fighting inequality in eastern Sudan and Darfur. He fought fiercely toward this end and succeeded in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges so that the south could negotiate with one voice. 
   After years of negotiations and countless failed attempts, it appeared that Dr. Garang's efforts would finally pay off in January of 2005 as the historic peace agreement which would end Africa's longest running civil war was signed in Nairobi, Kenya. His tragic death on July 30, 2005 proved to be the first major test of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan. Unfortunately, it would not be the last. 
   It is critical that the United States Government not lose sight of the challenges that remain in implementation. Too many innocents have died. It is time for all Sudanese to pursue the path toward peace and it is incumbent upon us to help them on their way. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for recognizing the great work that both Chairman Lantos as well as Congressman Gillmor of Ohio have done in paying attention to this issue of NATO. 
   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to support this very timely legislation. This measure is a further step in helping to ensure that NATO, its member states and those aspiring to join this alliance are united in pursuit of European democracy and security. 
   Since its formation in 1949, NATO's mission has been to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of its members by promoting stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area.     
   The measure before us serves to express America's continued support for these important goals. 
   The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act should help to nurture all those European states that may eventually join that alliance and give it a sense of common strategic peacekeeping goals, by encouraging them to prepare, assume and maintain the responsibilities of membership. 
   Specifically, the legislation calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine to NATO and authorizes security assistance for these countries in fiscal year 2008. The standards for joining NATO should not be lowered in any way and each country should be evaluated individually on the merits. 
   Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have been making progress on reforms through their participation in the NATO Membership Action Plan since 2002. 
   Georgia and Ukraine have not yet been granted a Membership Action Plan, but these two nations are making strides in order to qualify for MAP. 
   The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act will provide important incentives and assistance to the countries to continue the implementation of democratic, defense and economic reforms. In these times, Madam Speaker, when we have important missions to accomplish overseas, I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of this measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Gillmor, who just returned from a NATO conference overseas.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, what concerns me most about the amendment is its requirement for a report by the Secretary that includes a strategy to help developing countries to adapt to climate change, and I quote, ``including the provision of United States assistance to developing countries and an identification of existing funding sources, and a description of new funding sources that will be required specifically for such purposes.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, it's one thing to have the executive branch agencies compose a strategy, but it's quite another to encourage, if not require, such agencies to find new ways to justify further increasing U.S. foreign assistance to these countries. 
   This strategy would come after the section of the bill, section 2202, which already calls for $200 million every year from the year 2008 to the year 2012 to be allocated for U.S. assistance and programs in developing countries that ``promote clean and efficient energy technologies.'' 
   I believe that there is a positive intent behind this amendment, and I commend my colleague, Ms. Solis, from California for offering it. But it would be a better proposal if it did not have a requirement that the report from the Secretary of State include a strategy that basically instructs the Secretary to tell us how to spend more money. 
   So I hope that our colleagues would reject this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We all agree that the United States can be a leader on a number of global and environmental issues and we seek to find innovative ways to address these challenges. 
   This bill is not the answer. It is merely a compilation of regulation, increased funding, and the creation of additional layers of bureaucracy. 
   Title II of this bill, the Foreign Affairs title, sets up a new office structure at the State Department to focus on climate change, but it ignores the fact that we already have an office in the Department's Bureau of Oceans, Environment and Science that deals with these very issues. The bill is silent on how many new personnel will be needed for this new office and at what cost. 
   This legislation also seeks to ignore the current efforts in the existence of the senior climate negotiator and special representative by creating a new duplicative decision. Title II, section C, of this bill proposes a new, federally supported organization entitled the International Clean Energy Foundation, which would duplicate the grant-making work of the State Department, USAID, and the United Nations. 
   The bill authorizes $100 million over 5 years for this Foundation and essentially guarantees that the Foundation will exist forever. 
   In fact, following passage by the Foreign Affairs Committee of a bill which became title II of H.R. 3221, we received an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office which says that just the Foreign Affairs title of the bill would cost $772 million over the years 2008 to 2012. That is $772 million over 5 years. 
   A few short months ago, we had a debate in the House on the Intelligence authorization bill, which contained a provision mandating that the intelligence community use its resources to develop a National Intelligence Estimate on the issue of global warming. We thought that the majority would wait to receive an assessment of the nature and extent of the problem, as well as a range of factors contributing to the problem before having the House vote on this bill. But this was not to be. 
   As public servants, our overarching responsibility should be to do no harm. This legislation, I agree, runs contrary to that principle. 
   We all share a desire to do more to exert U.S. leadership in the environmental realm. We must be careful not to fool ourselves into believing that throwing money at the problem and adding layers of bureaucracy are truly effective ways of addressing this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill, and I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) for authoring the resolution before us; and I rise in support of his resolution, 412, which expresses gratitude to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, for their recent state visit to the United States and reaffirms the friendship that exists between the United States and the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth's visit reminded us of the shared values that underpin the unique friendship and partnership of the United States and the United Kingdom. 
   The extent to which the United States and the United Kingdom today share common goals in their foreign and defense policies as well is also quite remarkable. There is no other bilateral relationship that the United States has with another country that is routinely referred to as ``the special relationship.'' 
   In the time that Queen Elizabeth has reigned, more than half a century, America and Britain have continually strengthened their partnership and collaborated on threats to world peace and security, both large and small. That important collaboration continues today, as President Bush noted in his remarks in the dinner he held at the White House in the Queen's honor, when he stated the following: ``together we are supporting young democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan ..... confronting global challenges such as poverty and disease and terrorism, and together we're working to build a world in which more people can enjoy prosperity and security and peace.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I should note as well the significance of how closely the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom are linked. The United Kingdom is the fourth largest market for exports, such exports totaling more than $36 billion in the year 2004 alone. Just as significant, the United States and the United Kingdom are each other's biggest foreign investors. 
   This resolution gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the strength and the value of a trans-Atlantic relationship that has proven critical to safeguarding the community of democracies in Europe and, indeed, throughout the world. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution, expressing appreciation to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for their recent visit and the bonds that tie our two nations together.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (SENATOR PAUL SIMON STUDY ABROAD FOUNDATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am very proud to join Chairman Lantos in introducing his bill, H.R. 1469, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2007. The Act gives effect to key recommendations of the bipartisan, congressionally mandated report of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission as well as the 9/11 Commission report. 
   The United States has an increasing need for foreign language expertise, cultural knowledge and better people-to-people diplomacy. We saw a dramatic example of this need, lamentably, after the events of 9/11 when we faced a sudden shortage of qualified speakers of Arabic, Farsi and other strategic languages. A study released last August by the Government Accountability Office indicated that serious language gaps remain within the State Department that can adversely impact State's ability to communicate with foreign audiences and execute critical duties. Study abroad by more American students in places other than traditional destinations in western Europe is essential to our Nation's security and future leadership in the world. 
   For these reasons, the gentleman from California's bill, H.R. 1469, aims to increase the number and diversity of American students studying abroad with an eventual goal of 1 million per year. It ensures that most of the increase occurs in nontraditional and strategically important destinations, such as China, the Middle East and the developing world. 
   This Act will establish the Simon Study Abroad Foundation, an independent U.S. Government corporation that can raise private sector funds to promote its work, freed from the large bureaucracies and short-term agendas of other U.S. agencies. By offering competitive grants to universities and educational consortiums based on its priorities, the Foundation will generate broader interest among American schools in study abroad programs, leveraging an impact far greater than a mere direct grant program for students. 
   To ensure maximum transparency and efficiency, the Foundation will be subject to oversight by an Inspector General and annual congressional reporting requirements. 
   I appreciate Chairman Lantos incorporating my proposals for those oversight mechanisms in the introduced text of the bill. 
   I also was pleased to consult with him regarding the small changes made to the bill after committee consideration. Three minor changes make explicit what was already implicit in the bill: Two of them confirm that the Foundation is a new and different approach not intended to supplant other exchange and direct-grant programs currently run by the State Department. The third makes clear that the Foundation should take care to fund only safe, high-quality study abroad programs. A fourth, substantive change aims to make the Foundation more  cost-effective by eliminating the compensation for board members that was part of the originally introduced text. 
   In sum, this Act, Mr. Speaker, represents a creative, forward-thinking initiative to protect American leadership and security in a fast-changing world. H.R. 1469 deserves our enthusiastic support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 152, which congratulates the citizens of Israel on the 40th anniversary of that nation's victory over those who sought to destroy it in the Six Day War and commemorates the 40th anniversary of Jerusalem's reunification. 
   Jerusalem has historically been a united city, one holy for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Last week I had the privilege to go on a congressional delegation to Israel with my distinguished colleague and friend from Florida, Mr. Wexler. There we visited the old city of Jerusalem and prayed at the ancient Temple's legendary Western Wall. At that site, and throughout the City of Jerusalem, people have freely beseeched God for centuries. But had Jerusalem still been divided, as it was from 1948 to 1967, the old city's holy places would have been off limits to us and to millions of others. 
   Therefore, I stand here today with particular appreciation for the religious freedom that Jerusalem's unity entails. It is unfortunate, however, that much of the world continues to refuse to recognize Jerusalem's unity and specifically its status as Israel's capital, a status which is both appropriate and a fact of reality. 
   The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 states that it is a matter of U.S. policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel and that the United States should move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The resolution before us, H. Con. Res. 152, reaffirms U.S. policy in this regard, and I hope that the administration and our allies worldwide will move swiftly to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move their embassies to that city. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, to clearly articulate that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise in strong support of House Resolution 422, which calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur. 
   I wish to thank my colleague from California, Ms. Barbara Lee, for introducing this important measure, and for all of the cosponsors who she has gathered and their strong and steadfast support of efforts to halt the humanitarian disaster which continues to unfold daily in Sudan. 
   I had the honor of traveling to the camps of the internally displaced persons in Darfur with Ms. Lee, and I thank her for her courageous leadership in this effort. 
   In July 2004, as my good friend from Tennessee stated, the House boldly declared that genocide was occurring in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Nearly 3 years later, the bombing, rape and murder continue. 
   Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes by marauding militias and a callous government bent on total destruction. 
   And while I'm encouraged by the leadership of our United States Government and attempts to end this carnage, I cannot help but feel a profound sense of frustration. Where is the rest of the international community?

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this resolution authored by our good friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), which condemns the violence within Estonia, condemns the attacks on Estonia's Embassy in Russia that have taken place recently, and which expresses our solidarity with the government and the people of Estonia in the face of such violence and intimidation. 
   As the chairman has pointed out, the April 27 relocation by the Estonian government of a Soviet-era statue and memorial, located in the capital, led some ethnic Russians within Estonia and some Russians in Russia itself to undertake violent demonstrations and threatening intimidation. These events presented the rest of the world with the worrisome prospect that Estonia and other countries once held captive by the former Soviet regime would continue to be subjected to organized, threatening behavior by their neighbor, Russia. 
   Additionally troublesome is the possibility that such behavior might be supported by officials at high levels within the Russian government. 
   It is the view of the most impartial observers that in the days that followed the memorial's relocation, the Russian government quite obviously failed to adequately protect the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, which was threatened for some time by a mob. 
   In Estonia itself, government, commercial and media Web sites observed a series of suspicious and devastating cyber attacks, reportedly originating from within Russia in what appeared to be a very organized manner.     
   All of that followed very violent demonstrations mounted by some ethnic Russians within Estonia, demonstrations that required significant engagement by the police to halt. 
   Mr. Speaker, since regaining their independence with the fall of the Soviet regime, Estonia, as well as the other Baltic States, have worked hard to overcome the serious impact of that decades-long occupation, a period in which the native population in Estonia came close to becoming a minority, a minority in their own land, due to the actions of the Soviet government. 
   Many Baltic citizens were deemed to be threats to that occupation and they were shipped off to Siberia, some never to be seen again, while ethnic Russians were assigned by the regime to settle in the Baltic States. 
   But with renewed independence, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have had the opportunity to again take control of their future. 
   To their credit, they have worked with the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European Union to find ways to address the presence of those who had been settled on their territories during the Soviet era, finding procedures to grant proper citizenship that, while tough in some cases, nevertheless provided a means for the large ethnic Russian minorities to participate in the civic life of those states whose independence was no longer questioned. 
   The European Union and the NATO alliance recognized the efforts by these Baltic States to constructively address the challenges and to implement general democratic and free market reforms. 
   That is why Estonia and other Baltic States are today members of both the European Union and NATO, and why those organizations have stood by Estonia in the face of the disproportionate reaction to the recent relocation of the memorial, that reaction appearing to have had its roots in Moscow. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Baltic States have more than earned their independence through decades of repression and suffering under a Communist regime. 
   It is important that through the adoption of this resolution before us today, authored by Mr. Shimkus of Illinois, we make it clear that we stand in support of Estonia and its independence in the face of threats and intimidation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of Mr. Shimkus' resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the author of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 430, which decries the unlawful imprisonment of dual U.S.-Iranian citizens by the regime in Tehran. As this resolution illustrates, Iranian intelligence officials have unlawfully detained, interrogated and imprisoned numerous dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, in particular Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, who works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 
   The Iranian government incarcerated Dr. Esfandiari in Evin Prison in Tehran on May 9 of this year. However, as I noted, this is not an isolated incident by any means. The Iranian government also confiscated the passport of Radio Farda journalist Parnaz Azima, an American citizen, when she arrived in Iran to visit her ill mother in January earlier this year. 
   Iranian government officials have interrogated Ms. Azima and pressured her to collaborate with Iranian intelligence. Iran has also imprisoned a consultant for the Open Society Institute and a fourth American citizen who has chosen to remain anonymous and who has been unlawfully detained in Iran for 6 months. 
   Mr. Speaker, this cannot stand. The Iranian government's recent actions are particularly egregious in light of that regime's past involvement in the killing of Americans and its past incitement and support of the taking of 66 American citizens hostages at the U.S. embassy in Tehran on February 4, 1979, with 52 of those Americans held in captivity for 444 days. 
   In response, we must remain resolute in our condemnation of the Iranian regime for detaining innocent American citizens for political purposes and demand that the Iranian regime immediately and unconditionally permit all American citizens detained in Iran against their will to leave. 
   These threatening actions by the Iranian regime come amidst Tehran's ongoing support for Islamic militants in Iraq that are killing Iraqis and Americans alike, its arming and support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza and its continued pursuit of nuclear capability in contempt of international demands that it suspend its enrichment activities. I therefore believe that the United States should suspend all contact with any agent, instrumentality or representative of the Iranian regime until Americans held hostage by Iran are released and other issues critical to the United States are addressed. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, last month, a member of the majority leadership stated, ``This war is lost, and the surge has not accomplishing anything.'' He further stated, ``We are going to pick up Senate seats as a result of this war,'' and adding that he had been shown numbers that are compelling and astounding.     
   I cannot imagine that there were many in either party who were not shocked by these brazenly cynical words. 
   This past Saturday, I sat down with Phyllis and Huber Parsons, constituents from my congressional district who have three sons serving in Baghdad. They are pictured here in the poster behind me. They are officers with the Army Stryker Brigade. They said to me that remarks such as the ones that I just quoted by our congressional leaders ``made them sick.'' Their sons, Charlie, Huber and Bill, are not bullets to be used to hit a political target. And while some of my colleagues may not agree with the administration's efforts to win the battle against Islamic jihadists in Iraq, the Parsons brothers should not be abandoned without ammunition to defend themselves. 
   My stepson, Doug, and my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, both served in Iraq. Lindsay is now in Afghanistan. They were not following the orders of would-be generals here in Congress. They were serving their country and their President, whom the Constitution clearly states is the commander-in-chief. 
   Not one of us here in Congress can usurp that role. Nor can we fill the role of General David Petraeus, who bears the enormous burden of directing this war and who has said that our mission is just and necessary. 
   These men and women of our Armed Forces, such as the Parsons brothers and my stepson and daughter-in-law, understand their mission. They understand that they are locked in a generational struggle with global Islamic radicals who seek our destruction. If we declare that we have been beaten in this phase of the struggle and then retreat, it will only grow, it will follow us home, and it may never end. 
   Imposing a timetable for withdrawal of our forces and retreating over the horizon, as some have suggested, will not insulate us from the terrible strategic consequences that would result. This fighting will spill into neighboring countries, threaten our allies and then spread throughout the Middle East. 
   In addition to these frightening strategic consequences, if we surrender the Iraqi nation to the terrorists, we would open the gates to a potential humanitarian crisis of epic proportions, including mass murder and displacements of thousands and thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children that our retreat helped make possible. 
   Let me remind the advocates of defeat of the words of one of our former presidents who battled against the legions of those who sought to block his efforts to save democracy for this country and for the world. He said, ``This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. In this world of ours, there are some people, who seem to have grown too weary to carry on the fight. I believe in my heart that only our success can stir their ancient hope. They begin to know that here in America we are waging a great and successful war. It is a war for the survival of democracy.'' 
   These are the words of Franklin Roosevelt, and I think were he here today, I am confident that he would never give in to those who say that we have lost and who demand that we retreat. 
   I ask my colleagues to uphold the President's veto and demand a clean supplemental to support our troops in the field, to give Bill, Charlie and Huber Parsons the resources they need to achieve victory in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the debate on Iraq yesterday, we heard many times from some of our Democratic colleagues that they had no intention of defunding our troops in Iraq. Some even expressed outrage and indignation when some of our Republican Members made mention of their plans for defunding the troops. However, defunding plans clearly demonstrate their policy is to withdraw from the global war against Islamic militant extremists by surrendering to the enemy in Iraq. 
   We are faced with two options in Iraq, Mr. Speaker, to move forward or to retreat. Some of my Democrat colleagues appear to be united in opposing any effort to adopt a more vigorous strategy in Iraq and, instead, are ready to retreat. This resolution is but the first step in that direction. 
   Despite denials, the evidence is that the effort to cut the funding of our troops in Iraq and, in turn, for all of our efforts there are well underway. 
   Several bills have already been introduced by Democrat Members to compel a withdrawal. Let me read the titles and the provisions. 
   H.R. 508, to require the United States military disengagement from Iraq, which mandates a withdrawal of U.S. forces within 6 months of the enactment of this act and which cuts off funding for any deployment or continued deployment of forces in Iraq. Let me emphasize that again. It cuts off funding for any deployment, not just an increase, not just sending reinforcements, but for any deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq, including those already there, and it even limits the number of embassy personnel. 
   Also, H.R. 438, to prohibit an escalation in the number of members of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq, which states that funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense under any provision of law may not be obligated or expended to increase the number of members of the United States Armed Forces serving in Iraq. 
   H.R. 746, to provide for the safe and orderly withdrawal of United States military forces and Department of Defense contractors from Iraq, which mandates the beginning of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days of the enactment of this act and complete the withdrawal no later than 180 days later. It also prohibits  funds to increase the number of Armed Forces serving in Iraq or to extend the deployment of those already there. 
   Or H.J. Res. 18, to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq, which states that the deployment of United States forces in Iraq by the direction of Congress is hereby terminated, and the forces involved are to be redeployed at the earliest practical date. 
   When we offered a proposal to prohibit the cutting off of funds for our troops, that is what we wanted to do on our side of the aisle, a proposal to prohibit cutting off of funding of our troops in harm's way, the Democratic leadership blocked it from coming to the floor. Why? Well, based on the bills that I just mentioned, the only explanation I would think is that they fear that their caucus would indeed vote to cut off funding for our troops and leave them to face the enemy without the necessary resources. 
   So, within this context, they offer this nonbinding resolution which the Democrat leadership claims to support the troops. But how can such a claim be credible? Because in the second paragraph of the resolution, it opposes sending the reinforcements that our troops in Iraq need to confront the enemy.     
   Our commanders in the field say they need the reinforcements in order to address the security situation in Iraq. My stepson Douglas Lehtinen and my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, served in Iraq as Marine officers. Lindsay will soon serve in just a few weeks in Afghanistan. They understand the difference between saying we support our troops but we don't support your mission. It is the mission that matters. 
   Some of our colleagues seek to deny our troops that level of support, that level of backup which could be the difference for Dougie, for Lindsay, for so many others between death and survival. 
   This resolution seeks to substitute the assessment of the military commanders with the views of lawmakers. We claim to know more than the commanders. 
   Rather than focusing on the strategic policy issue, the Democratic leadership has drafted a resolution that undermines tactical military matters and seeks to override the decisions of our military commanders and the position articulated by General Petraeus. They do not want to discuss the grave consequences of withdrawal and surrender. They do not want to discuss the nature of the enemy, the Islamist militant extremists who seek to destroy us, who like vultures descend on us to prey on our weakness. 
   Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seek to focus on the abstract rather than on the reality. They believe that security will come from withdrawal and surrender. On the contrary, retreat guarantees that the Islamic militants will intensify their efforts against us. All we need to do is focus on bin Laden's own words. 
   In his 1996 Declaration of Jihad and other statements that he made, he repeatedly pointed to America's weakness being its low threshold for pain. As evidence, bin Laden pointed to the U.S. withdrawal from Somalia in 1993 because of casualties from the attacks of al Qaeda and its allies. Bin Laden said of our retreat from Mogadishu, ``The extent of your impotence and weakness became very clear.'' 
   Bin Laden and the global Islamic militant network continued to test our resolve throughout the 1990s and today. They launched multiple attacks against U.S. targets with little response on our part. Then came the deplorable attacks on 9/11. 
   But they won't stop there, Mr. Speaker. They won't stop in Iraq, they won't stop in Afghanistan. They have made it abundantly clear that they will not stop until they dominate the world. Just listen to the words of bin Laden. 
   He said, ``The jihad in Palestine,'' referring to the attacks against Israel, ``and in Iraq is a personal duty incumbent upon the residents of the two countries alone. But if they are unable to carry it out, this duty is incumbent upon the residents of the adjacent countries, and so on and so forth, until the circle includes all the Muslim countries.'' 
   And to focus on what al Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri said in December of last year just a few months ago, ``Iraq, Allah permitting, is the gateway to the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of the Islamic caliphate.'' 
   Or those of Iran's Ahmadinejad when he said in January of this year, ``We must prepare ourselves to rule the world.'' 
   This follows statements made in October of 2005 when Ahmadinejad said, ``Undoubtedly, I say that we will soon experience a world without the United States and will breathe in the brilliant time of Islamic sovereignty over today's world.'' 
   It is echoed by other Iranian leaders who have threatened the U.S. and moderate Arab governments who say that, ``Anyone who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nations. They will burn in their fury,'' and who have expressed their commitment to bringing America to its knees. 
   The Islamist militant extremist network have proven time and time again that this is not mere rhetoric. U.S. allies in the Middle East understand this reality. They understand the critical role that Iraq plays in the global war against Islamic militant extremists. 
   For example, Jordan's King Abdullah, a courageous leader who continues to demonstrate his country's and his people's commitment to peace, to security, and to democratic reform, summarized the situation we are facing in the following way. He said, ``My concern is political, revolving around Iran, around Iran's political involvement inside Iraq, its relation with Syria and Hezbollah, and the strengthening of this political strategic alliance. This would create a scenario where you have these four: Iran, Iraq, influenced by Iraq, Syria, and Hezbollah, who have a strategic objective that would create a major conflict. Our argument to the United States,'' he continues, ``is that a capable, independent, secure Iraq is the best way of containing Iran. The Iranians realize that the way to have success against the West is by them succeeding in Iraq. So Iraq is the battleground of the West against Iran.'' 
   These are the words of our ally King Abdullah of Jordan. Yet some of our colleagues choose to believe that one can reason with our enemies. 
   Since this resolution provides no concrete alternative, some have expressed support for new diplomatic initiatives. However, I must ask my colleagues: With whom? Do they propose engaging with rogue regimes such as Iran and Syria? These rogue regimes are part of the problem, not part of the solution. 
   Some of our colleagues may say that diplomatic engagement is the key to our success. But I ask them, how are we to engage our allies in the region to help foster security and reconciliation in Iraq if by our withdrawal and surrender we leave them to fend for themselves against enemies in the region who have been strengthened by our retreat? How is diplomacy to be effective in such an abstract context? 
   We cannot expect to achieve success if we are operating from a position of weakness. 
   The so-called diplomatic alternative offered by some is no alternative at all. The resolution before us and the bills that have been introduced is a compelling argument, they believe, for a withdrawal from Iraq, but it adds to a policy of surrender. 
   Some may try to hide that fact by constantly repeating the empty words that they support the troops. But supporting our troops cannot be reconciled by refusing them the reinforcements that they need or with the retreat in the face of the enemy. 
   The hopelessness with which these measures spring is alien to our American spirit. That spirit has sustained us through many dark times, Mr. Speaker, throughout our history. This hopeful spirit springs directly from the hearts of the American people who have never given up faith in their belief, in their country, in their sons and daughters in uniform facing our enemies overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of our revolution over two centuries ago when our country faced almost impossible odds and many counseled for retreat, Thomas Payne summoned forth the words that apply directly to the debate in this Chamber when he said, ``These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country, but he that stands by it now deserves the love and  the thanks of every man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us: That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues therefore to reject this resolution.

And I would like to say to all Members that although the debate tonight may have seemed uncivil at times, this is the wonderful process that we have here in democracy in this wonderful country, my adopted homeland. And my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) and I disagree on so many issues, and yet we understand that this is indeed the greatest country in the world. We want peace and stability to all oppressed people throughout the world. 
   I happen to believe that the mission of the United States of America and the mission of the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform is a noble one. It is noble to stand up for freedom and for democracy; it is noble to fight against the radical Islamic Jihadists, who I believe do want to destroy our country, who want to destroy our allies like Israel, and want to destroy our way of life. I believe that the mission is just and I think that those who say we cannot stay the course, then how could they be against the decision of the President to send reinforcements? Because the decision of the President says that staying the course is not the right motion for the United States to make. We want to change the course. We want a new way forward. And the way forward is to send reinforcements to those brave men and women who are wearing proudly our Nation's uniform, who are standing in harm's way, and we want to give them everything that they need to succeed in their mission. 
   I have been to Iraq as have many Members and I have come to understand what their mission has been and they say, ``Don't just say we support our troops. Say you support our mission. Don't leave us out there in the field.'' 
   And as I said in my previous remarks, Mr. Speaker, this is going to be an escalation and we will soon be cutting off funding for our troops and leave them in harm's way. That is a dangerous path.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Harp seals, which live off of Canada's east coast, are sought for their pelts. Canadian hunters, who are regulated by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, have killed almost a million seals in the past 3 years. The government set a quota of 270,000 seals for the season of 2007, which is lower than the limit of 335,000 seals set in last year's season. The quota is determined annually by the department and is set based on estimates of the current seal population. Many concerned citizens are quite upset that these seals are killed in an inhumane way, since many  are beaten unconscious and then skinned while they are still alive. 
   An independent group of veterinarians, invited by the International Fund for Animal Welfare to observe the seal hunt, concluded that the seal hunt was out of compliance with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada. Also, 95 percent of the seals are less than a year old. 
   This resolution urges Canada to end the commercial seal hunt. Our Canadian friends are good allies and partners in many areas of common interest, and we hope that they will take this important step. Many have raised alarm about this, including our distinguished chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos, and I thank him for his many years of leadership on the plight of people who have been abused, but also animals who have been mistreated. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 188. 
   Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago, on July 18, a radical Islamist with ties to the terrorist group Hezbollah bombed the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the heart and soul of the largest Jewish community in South America, killing 85 innocent people. From the beginning of the investigation into this horrific act of anti-Semitism and mass murder, the evidence pointed to the involvement of Hezbollah and its state sponsor, Iran. Moreover, the AMIA bombing opened our eyes, 7 years before 9/11, to the growing threat of radical Islam and Islamic extremists and terrorists in the western hemisphere, our own backyard. 
   The tri-border area, where Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina meet, continues to be a lawless zone where Islamist terrorist groups meet and engage in arms, drug dealing and contraband smuggling that finances their deadly deeds and aims. It could easily become a base of operations to carry out further terrorist attacks that could even strike on U.S. soil. Therefore, to address this threat to our interests and national security, the United States and our allies must bring to justice those responsible for past acts of terror. We must vigilantly combat radical Islamic terrorist groups before they strike again. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, for over a decade those responsible for the atrocity at AMIA have not been captured and prosecuted, causing our enemies to be emboldened to strike again. Nonetheless, despite numerous obstacles, the wheels of justice have started to gain momentum. 
   Last October, the state prosecutor of Argentina concluded that the AMIA bombing was, in his words, ``decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former Government of Iran whom, at the same time, entrusted its execution to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah.'' 
   Last March, acting on the state prosecutor's conclusions, INTERPOL's executive committee recommended the issuance of red notices for five Iranian officials and one Hezbollah operative in connection with the bombing.     
   Iran, still determined to act with impunity, has appealed the Executive Committee's decision to INTERPOL's General Assembly, which will meet upcoming this November. 
   It is vital, vital, Mr. Speaker, that INTERPOL's General Assembly uphold the recommendation of the Executive Committee and issue the red notices, which could lead to the arrest of these individuals. 
   To successfully prosecute this case, Argentina must be able to arrest and extradite the named Islamic militant and Iranian officials. 
   It is important to note that at least one of the five indicted Iranian officials worked for the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires at the time of the AMIA bombing. 
   The evidence appears to indicate that Iran used officials who have diplomatic immunity to help support and plan the attack, and that Iran has used its embassies abroad to further its terrorist plots and radical Islamic goals. 
   Indeed, all signs show that Iran is vigorously increasing its diplomatic presence in the western hemisphere, seeking to increase its power, to spread its radical Islamic ideology, to undermine the United States, and to wreak havoc throughout the region. These dangerous efforts must be addressed, Mr. Speaker. 
   Many nations in the hemisphere have joined with the United States and regional organizations to fight the growing threat of Islamic extremists that has become evident since the AMIA bombing. For example, several nations participate in joint counterterrorism training and simulations and have joined counterterrorist protocols and agreements. 
   Argentina deserves particular commendation. In addition to its significant progress in the AMIA investigation during the past year, Argentina recently approved legislation which criminalizes financing, fund-raising, and money laundering by groups linked to terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, these nations deserve our continued support and encouragement. However, there is much left to be done. 
   H. Con. Res. 188, which I introduced with the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, seeks to address a number of  issues that we have raised. The resolution condemns the AMIA attacks, honors the victims, and, thirdly, expresses our sympathy to their long-suffering families. 
   It also calls upon the General Assembly of INTERPOL to issue and implement the red notices supported by INTERPOL Executive Committee, and calls upon responsible nations to cooperate fully with the AMIA investigation. 
   Mr. Speaker, for years, Chairman Lantos and I have spoken in this Chamber calling for justice to be served in the AMIA case. Finally, those responsible for this atrocity are running scared, recognizing that they may not escape the consequences of their crime, that we are determined to prevent history from repeating itself. 
   Justice may be delayed, but it must be denied. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise also in support of this resolution, which strikes an important balance, protecting the integrity of history and recognizing present-day reality. It also addresses an issue of great significance for the peoples of the Asia Pacific region. 
   The tragedy of the ``comfort women,'' the thousands of Asian and European women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during the first half of the 20th century, was a horrific crime. For the surviving ``comfort women'' these issues are not historical; they are profoundly personal. Some of them were in our Foreign Affairs Committee when this bill was marked up. Attempts to deny or minimize these facts are a disservice to future generations. 
   The case of Darfur, which we spoke about earlier today, Mr. Speaker, reminds us all that the issue of the use of military force to abuse women, to abuse children through rape and exploitation is one which we need to look at and one which unfortunately continues to this very day. 
   At the same time, the resolution makes clear that Japan has been a vital ally of the United States and a generous benefactor of the international community through several decades. It has been a strong ally of the United States on issues relating to, for example, nonproliferation. 
   It was recently reported that three Japanese banks have stopped engaging in any new business with Iran and that Japanese financial institutions are restricting loans and rejecting an Iranian request to pay for oil imports in currency other than dollars.  
   So we are proud of the U.S.-Japan alliance and grateful for the friendship of the people of Japan. At the same time, we should also recognize that the issue of unresolved historic grievances from the Pacific war is one that cannot be ignored. It is through reconciliation of these issues that our Asian allies can work constructively together, as is the case with our European allies, and the achievement of regional harmony is in America's vital national security interests

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (DARFUR ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to support the bill before us, H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. 
   It was 3 years ago this month, Mr. Speaker, that Congress passed the historic resolution declaring that genocide was occurring in the Darfur region of western Sudan. This was the first time in the history of this body that genocide was declared as the atrocities were occurring. 
   The decision to evoke the word ``genocide'' at that time was not taken lightly, but the evidence of vast slaughter, aerial bombardments and forced displacements targeted against the African tribes in Darfur left us with little choice. 
   No one could claim that they did not understand the gravity of the human rights and the security crisis in Darfur. We read about it in the papers. We saw the images on television. We heard about it from humanitarian groups in the region, and some of us have now even seen it with our own eyes. 
   It was believed that, by making such a bold declaration, other responsible nations would feel compelled to join the United States in taking firm action to halt this senseless slaughter of innocent civilians in this far off place, but here we are 3 years later and the carnage in Darfur continues. 
   Hundreds of thousands have been killed, over 2 million others have been forced from their homes. Entire villages have been razed, crops and wells destroyed, and countless young women and girls raped. And here we are again forced to go it alone, for the sake of the victims of genocide in Sudan. 
   Currently, the U.N. Security Council is once again held hostage to the search for consensus. Council members are engaged in a senseless debate over the latest resolution on Darfur, fighting over whether deploying a truly capable peacekeeping mission, with a chapter 7 mandate to protect civilians, violates the so-called sovereignty of a genocidal regime. 
   Several of my colleagues and I traveled to the United Nations last week as part of a delegation led by our majority leader, STENY HOYER. We focused our efforts on securing support for immediate action by the United Nations, but we cannot afford to continue to wait. 
   I cannot forget the faces of the children and the families in the camps that I visited in April. Their eyes spoke volumes, piercing through our souls, clamoring for the world to help them. 
   It is, therefore, time once again to take bold action in the hope that it will finally compel the murderous regime in Khartoum to simply end this madness. We need to send a clear message to Khartoum that we are not fooled by their half measures and delay tactics and that we are serious about ending this conflict. And to do so we must speak in language that they will surely understand, the language of economic interests.     
   This Sudanese regime has proven time and time again that it responds only to real pressure. The only true leverage we have is to strike at their economic interest. H.R. 180 does exactly that. It requires that the Secretary of the Treasury publish and maintain a list of companies or entities whose business dealings directly benefit the regime in Khartoum. It enables State and local governments to divest from those companies and provide safe harbor to fund managers who do divest. 
   In essence, this allows the contributors to and the beneficiaries of State and local government pension funds to avoid directly or indirectly supporting genocide in Darfur. Divestment campaigns of this nature have drawn criticism by some who fear that they inappropriately violate the sanctity of U.S. markets. 
   It is true divestments should not be taken lightly. But in the case of genocide, we are bound by conscience and overarching U.S. values to do all that is within our power to intervene. Having served as witness to this catastrophe, I have no hesitation in supporting the cause of divestment. 
   In fact, it gives me great pride to say that in my own district, south Floridians have joined in this humanitarian effort. It is time to stop funding the war machine in Sudan. Adoption of this legislation today will no doubt put us at odds with a number of our allies, with members of the U.N. Security Council, and those with significant economic interest with Sudan, such as China. 
   Our labeling of the atrocities in Darfur as genocide also put us at odds with others. But their indifference did not deter us in 2004, and it must not deter us now. I urge my fellow Members to take a stand today on behalf of the people of Darfur and to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of the bill before us, H.R. 2347, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. BARNEY FRANK of Massachusetts. 
   And I'm proud to cosponsor this bill, Mr. Speaker, because it's based on language that I drafted, and was adopted by the House last Congresses past as part of the Iran Freedom Support Act. 
   As all of us have heard from the great discussions this morning, Iran's rogue regime has sworn to destroy us, has sworn to destroy Israel, and has throughout decades. It's demonstrated the will and the capacity to do so. It has a long record of pursuing nuclear capabilities and of supporting the extreme elements of Islam, including Hamas, Hezbollah and those who kill and maim Americans in Iraq. 
   In fact, some have reported that Iran is providing the deep-buried IEDs that are indeed increasing the carnage in Iraq. 
   No amount of handholding, no amount of dialogue will be able to deter Tehran. 
   As part of an effort to prevent foreign funds from going to the Iranian regime, the bill before us authorizes State and local governments to direct divestiture and prevent investment in companies with investment of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. 
   And furthermore, the bill requires that a list of those companies that have invested $20 million or more be published biannually. 
   Furthermore, it protects investment companies and managers from being sued for divesting from companies included in the published list. 
   And although I fully support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I commend Chairman Frank for his efforts on this critical issue, as well as Mr. Sherman, who's been a leader on all the bills related to Iran, I'm concerned that this bill merely authorizes divestment from companies investing in Iran, rather than making divestment from those companies mandatory.     
   H.R. 1357, a bill I introduced earlier this year, along with Minority Whip ROY BLUNT, would require divestment of all government pension plans or Thrift Savings Plans. Moreover, H.R. 1357 prohibits all future investments of government and private pension plans. 
   I strongly believe that we must increase the pressure aimed at isolating Iran's extremist regime, and the bill authored by Chairman Frank is an important step toward achieving this goal, and I commend him for it. 
   There are currently, also, Mr. Speaker, multiple measures dealing with putting further pressure on Iran including the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act, authored by Congressman TOM LANTOS, the chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee; and we have got to work to have those bills passed and build upon them in order to derail the dangerous ambitions of Iran. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is part of the effort of many of us to prevent U.S. dollars from enabling and facilitating the murderous efforts of radical extremists who intend to destroy us and our allies. 
   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding me the time, and I thank the chairman, Mr. Frank of Massachusetts, for this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize my good friend from California, Ms. BARBARA LEE, for her leadership in introducing this bill, which is intended to deepen our educational cooperation with our neighbors in the Caribbean. 
   H.R. 176 authorizes the creation of the Shirley A. Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Program to help provide U.S. educational opportunities to qualified students from the countries of the Caribbean community.     
   It also authorizes State and USAID to expand existing primary and secondary school initiatives in the Caribbean to provide programs on teacher training methods, school management,  curriculum development, and increase community involvement in school activities. 
   Increasing the quality of educational opportunities available to our good neighbors in the Caribbean serves the interests of our entire region, and deepens the goodwill that already exists between the people of our countries. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Lee and Chairman Lantos for working with me at the committee level to incorporate language ensuring that state sponsors of terrorism do not receive the benefits provided under this bill. The committee also amended the text to authorize such sums as may be necessary rather than a sum certain for the new programs. This will help ensure that any new activities under the act will not disrupt those educational and exchange programs already being implemented in the region by the State Department and USAID. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in preparing this bill for floor consideration.

   Mr. Speaker, the sponsor of this resolution, Mr. Chabot, is unfortunately delayed due to airport difficulties, but his statement will be included for the Record. 
   Confucius once declared that ``greeting an old friend from afar is one of life's greatest pleasures.'' Well, the purpose of this resolution is to carry out this wise saying of Confucius, for the leaders and people of Taiwan have been among the most steadfast friends of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. From the dark days of the Korean War and the Taiwan Strait crisis of the late 1950s, the people of Taiwan and the people of the United States have stood together against the threat of communist tyranny. 
   A half century of friendship has developed, with deepening commercial ties, and in more recent years, a shared love of democratic values. It is only natural, as Confucius noted, to warmly welcome the leaders of such close friends to Washington. 
   But the restrictions placed on travel to our country by democratically elected officials in Taiwan, adopted by a series of U.S. administrations, is a self-inflicted wound. The often-quoted Shanghai communique issued in 1972 contains no such restriction. Nor is there any limitation spelled out in the Taiwan Relations Act. In this regard, the intentions of Congress in the Taiwan Relations Act are clear: ``To promote the foreign policy of the United States by authorizing the continuation of commercial, cultural and other relations between the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan.'' How can such relations be promoted without direct communications between officials of the United States and Taiwan? 
   No one likes being told whom they can or cannot invite to their own home. Americans consider their home to be ``their castle,'' with a sacred right to decide their own affairs within. No outsider should dictate rules and regulations within the American home. 
   So let's put out the welcome mat for our friends, the democratically elected officials from Taiwan, by giving overwhelming support to this long overdue resolution. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for authoring it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   All of us know, Mr. Speaker, that Iran is a growing threat to the region and to U.S. national security interests. 
   Iran's record for supporting Islamic extremists is dangerously supplemented by its continued violation of its nonproliferation obligations, its mockery of the International Atomic Energy Agency process, and its continued defiance of the United Nations Security Council's demands to halt its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing program. 
   Just last week, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, told Britain's newspapers, the Independent and the Guardian, that uranium enrichment was ``like breathing'' for his country, and that Iran would not halt the spinning centrifuges at its main enrichment plant at Natanz, even if the Bush  administration offered security guarantees. 
   We could just wait for further action from the United Nations to counter the Iranian threat, but even the Iranian regime is aware of the influence of Russia and China at the U.N. Security Council and the refusal of some of our European and Asian allies to sacrifice commercial interests for the sake of nonproliferation.     
   Just last Wednesday, Iranian leader Ahmadinejad said that U.N. resolutions could not prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear technology. He stated, ``Let's say that they issue Resolution Number 300. What will happen? It should be remembered that Iran is obtaining nuclear technology. They will have to eventually accept that.'' 
   Well, for almost 5 years, Mr. Speaker, Iran has been manipulating the so-called international community buying time to expand, to strengthen and to hide its nuclear activities. In fact, recent public reports further document the construction of a major tunnel complex inside the mountain near the Iranian facility at Natans, near the fortified buildings where the Iranian uranium is reportedly being processed. 
   This clearly illustrates the frenetic and advanced nature of that regime's nuclear weapon pursuit and should increase our sense of urgency. But the regime's pursuit of these destructive policies has one weakness: Iran's energy infrastructure. Iran's economy and its ability to influence events is heavily dependent on the revenues derived from energy exports. As such, recent U.S. efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction have focused on deterring and prohibiting investments in Iran's petroleum sector. 
   U.S. law prohibits American firms from investing in Iran. In addition, the Iran Sanctions Act seeks to influence responsible nations to stop their investment in Iran's energy sector, that is the economic lifeline of the regime, by calling for sanctions on those entities. Unfortunately, due to lack of enforcement, lack of commitment from some of our allies, foreign entities which fall outside of the jurisdiction of our country continue to invest in Iran, helping to fill the coffers, enabling the regime in Tehran to pursue not just a nuclear capability, but a chemical and biological program, long-range ballistic missiles and, as all of us know, they are a state sponsor of global Islamic extremism and terrorism. 
   As part of their effort to isolate Iran and deprive it of its revenues, it needs to fund its nuclear weapons program. My distinguished colleague, Chairman Lantos, and I introduced the Iran Freedom Support Act, which was enacted into law in September of last year. This legislation strengthens sanctions against those who invest in Iran's petroleum sector, the economic lifeline of the Iranian regime. However, the final version of the law did not include language that would make export credit agencies, insurers and other financial institutions subject to sanctions for their facilitation of investments in Iran's oil industry. 
   The bill before us, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 957 seeks to close this loophole. The imminent need to close this loophole and to compel responsible nations to do the right thing was clearly articulated in February of this year by Ambassador George Schulte, the chief U.S. representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Ambassador Schulte called on European governments to stop giving credits to subsidize exports to Iran and to take more measures to discourage investment and financial investment with Iran. 
   It is my hope that, despite the clarifications included in the suspension text at the request of other committees, that H.R. 957 is applied vigorously against those governments that claim to support our efforts to stop Iran's nuclear pursuit but fail to take tangible actions to deny the regime the resources to continue along this destructive and dangerous path. 
   H.R. 957 also seeks to expand the activities covered under the law to include petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas. Concerns were raised that existing law required the clarification that sanctions under the ISA should apply to certain foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies; therefore, H.R. 957 expands and extends the applications to U.S. foreign subsidiaries as defined in the bill. 
   This is a straightforward bill with a simple purpose: to enhance our ability to deprive Iran of the revenue it needs to fund its nuclear weapons and to secure greater cooperation from European, Asian, Russian and other allies to cut off the flow of funds to Iran. Responsible nations must immediately stop their multi-million, and in some cases billion, dollar investments in Iran's energy sector. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan measure to confront the Iranian threat. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, a prominent feature of this debate has been two sharply contrasting visions of the future. One vision sees no hope for us in Iraq and counsels that we withdraw, just give up. By contrast, the other mission focuses on success. We understand what accepting defeat means for Iraq. 
   We understand what accepting defeat means for Iraq, the region and our Nation's security interest. We support modifications and strategy to address the enemy's changing tactics, and we are committed to destroying the enemy before the enemy can destroy us. This success policy is rooted in the fabric of the American character, in our belief in the ability of our troops to achieve success in Iraq and Afghanistan and on all the fronts on this global war against Islamic militant jihadists. 
   The resolution at the center of this debate, Madam Speaker, lacks hope. It accepts defeat. It opposes reinforcements for our troops on the battlefield, reinforcements that strengthens their capacity to confront the enemy and succeed in their mission. 
   General Petraeus said that he cannot accomplish his mission without the deployment of additional U.S. forces. This resolution, however, announces that Congress will deny the commander in Iraq the means he says he needs to win. This resolution seeks to transform this House into 435 generals. 
   What is the next step in the strategy, Madam Speaker, after the crippling of our war effort? We know from statements and bills that have been introduced that plans will mandate the nature and the timing of a withdrawal by placing limitations on the funding of our efforts. A vote for this resolution then is a vote to proceed toward defunding of our troops. 
   Some believe that the impact of these decisions is confined to Iraq, but Iraq is only one front in the global war against radical Islamic jihadists. This is a war without boundaries. This is a war that poses the greatest challenge to our generation. 
   I will quote al-Zawahiri in his own words. He describes this fight in this way: 
   `` ..... Afghanistan and Iraq are the two most important fields for confronting the contemporary Crusader war. Therefore, the Muslim nation should support the mujahidin in these two countries with all its power.'' 
   Those are al-Zawahiri's own words. He talks about the war in Iraq as being central. He added that Iraq ``is the gateway to the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of the Islamic Caliphate.'' 
   Iran's leader has echoed similar views. He stated, we will soon experience a world without the United States; and he goes on to state, we must prepare ourselves to rule the world. 
   The enemy understands what is at stake. We must, also. 
   Once the retreat has started, where will it stop? Afghanistan? The Persian Gulf? The entire Middle East? Once we have abandoned our allies in Iraq, why should anyone in the world believe when we say that we draw a line in the sand and say that we will never abandon them. 
   Lawrence Haas, a former communications director for Vice President Gore, stated recently, `` ..... our enemies anticipate that Iraq will be the latest chapter in the book of American defeatism. Our withdrawal will embolden them to push ahead, confident that we  lack the stomach for confrontation, that our commitments mean nothing, that they can win simply by outlasting us.'' 
   A withdrawal in this generational fight will ensure that what is to come will be even worse. While urging a withdrawal, some state that they support the troops. But as leaders of the American Legion and the Veterans for Foreign Wars have stated, you cannot separate the warrior from the war. 
   My stepson, Douglas Lehtinen, and his wife, Lindsay, proudly served as Marine pilots in Iraq. Lindsay will soon leave for a tour in Afghanistan. Far from seeing their mission as hopeless, far from urging withdrawal, they and their fellow service men and women are committed to victory. They are so confident in that success that they are willing to risk their lives to secure it.     
   They would tell you that victory can never be ensured but that we can make defeat inevitable by giving our consent. The hopelessness from which this resolution springs is alien to our American spirit and it runs contrary to our history. What Thomas Paine said over two centuries ago stands still today: These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country. But he that stands by it now deserve the love and the thanks of every man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. 
   If you like the status quo in Iraq, Madam Speaker, then you vote ``yes'' on this resolution. If you favor a mission of success in defeating the Islamic militant jihadists who are our enemies, then please vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for the time. 
   At this difficult moment and in previous difficult moments in our Nation's history, there have always been those ready to declare that all was lost. Now we hear the voices of those proclaiming that the war against Islamic extremists in Iraq is lost. They say they support the troops, but the soldier cannot be separated from his mission. 
   When I consider the Parsons brothers from my congressional district, I know that our country has immense resources of courage and determination on which to draw. Huber Parsons was with the 101st Airborne for two long deployments in Iraq, and is currently on his third in Iraq with the Army Stryker Brigade. His twin, Bill, has served two tours in Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq. Their little brother, Charlie Parsons, is on his first deployment to Iraq. All three are serving in Baghdad right now, all three proud graduates of West Point. 
   Given the sacrifices and bravery of the Parsons brothers and all of the men and women serving our Nation in Iraq, we must not put them at risk by mandating artificial deadlines for withdrawal and surrender. 
   The consequences for our troops is a personal one for me. My stepson Doug and my daughter-in-law Lindsay both served in Iraq as marine fighter pilots, and Lindsay is currently deployed in Afghanistan.     
   Last time I spoke on the floor, I said Lindsay was about to be deployed. Well, she is there now, we are proud of her service. We are proud of all of the men and women serving our Nation wearing our Nation's uniform. 
   Imposing an artificial, arbitrary deadline for withdrawal of our forces before Iraq is stable and secure will give the insurgents and the Islamic terrorists a road map, a how-to guide on how to defeat the U.S., our Iraqi partners and other coalition forces in Iraq. 
   Let's help the Parsons brothers. Let's help all of our troops. Vote against the rule and against the conference report.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This past year has been an extremely tragic one for the nation of Burma and its long suffering people. Last fall, the world watched in horror as a corrupt and cruel military junta moved with barbaric vengeance against its own people. Even the monkhood, who led the people in the Saffron Revolution in this devoutly Buddhist nation, was not spared from the bayonets and the bullets of this blood-thirsty regime. 
   Television sets around the world were filled with images of midnight raids on temples and of monks and other peaceful demonstrators being shot at and arrested. 
   Many have simply disappeared into the Burmese gulag and have not been heard from again. International appeals for human decency and restraint have consistently fallen on deaf ears. This is a regime, after all, whose head general reportedly spent three times the national health budget on his daughter's wedding 2 years ago. A videotape smuggled out of Burma shows film clips of the bride dripping with diamonds. 
   The pictures are particularly disturbing when one reflects on the fact that Burma is one of the world's poorest countries. This is also the same regime who, following the devastation brought on by Cyclone Nargis, compounded its inept and inhumane response by actively blocking international relief efforts. 
   A flotilla of U.S. Navy ships, loaded with relief supplies, was forced to turn back after being rejected by junta leaders. This stonewalling took place as tens of thousands died and hundreds of thousands were left without food, without water, without shelter.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) for his remarks, and I thank most especially our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also from California, Mr. Berman, who has been a joy for our side to work with on this and many other measures. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the author of House Concurrent Resolution 385 which is a bipartisan resolution condemning the 1994 attack on AMIA, the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I would like to thank Chairman Berman for working with me in bringing this bill to the floor, and I thank the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) who will also be speaking on this. So many on our committee and beyond have joined us as cosponsors of this important resolution. 
   This Friday, Mr. Speaker, marks the 14th anniversary of the AMIA attack. It was the deadliest bombing in the history of Argentina. Eighty-five people were killed, and more than 300 wounded that day. In the year 2006, the government of Argentina concluded that the attack was ``decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former government of Iran who at the same time entrusted its execution to Hezbollah.'' 
   Among those found to be responsible were a former Iranian ambassador to Argentina; a former cultural attache at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires; a former official at the Iranian embassy; a former Iranian Minister of Security and Intelligence; and Ayatollah Rafsanjani, Iran's leader at the time of the AMIA bombing, who continues to wield power at the highest level of the Iranian regime. 
   In the year 2007, INTERPOL issued red notices for a Hezbollah operative and for five of the Iranian officials wanted by the government of Argentina in connection with the AMIA attack. This enabled arrest warrants for those individuals to be circulated worldwide with an eye toward their arrest and their extradition. 
   Unfortunately, the government of Saudi Arabia made no attempt to detain or to arrest two of the Iranian officials implicated in the AMIA bombing during their time in Saudi Arabia earlier this year.     
   The two departed without Saudi Arabia taking any action. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a failure to detain these two individuals. That is of grave concern, and I hope that it will not be repeated by other governments. 
   With this in mind, House Concurrent Resolution 385 urges all responsible nations to cooperate fully with the AMIA investigation by detaining and extraditing to Argentina any persons against whom Interpol has issued red notices for their role in the AMIA attack. Agents of the Iranian regime linked to the AMIA attack must once and for all be held responsible for their reprehensible actions. 
   Furthermore, the evidenced complicity of Iranian embassy officials in the AMIA attack clearly demonstrates that the Iranian regime has used its embassies as tools of extension of its radical goals. It also underscores the direct threat that these actions may have toward America's own national security. As the Iranian regime continues to greatly expand its diplomatic, its political and its economic pressure in our own western hemisphere so close, it is essential that we remain mindful of the danger that this may pose to us. 
   In closing, I would like to commend the government of Argentina on the significant advances that it has made in the investigation of the AMIA attack and congratulate the leadership of Argentina for the efforts that they have made to prevent similar extremist attacks from taking place in the future. 
   I am going to continue to work with my colleagues and others in the U.S. Government to ensure that we provide any support and cooperation requested by the government of Argentina to deepen and expand the investigation into this terrible AMIA bombing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased that we're taking up H.R. 5834, the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act that I introduced last month with my dear friend and partner, Congressman Berman of California. 
   Informed by the experience of the past 4 years, this bill reauthorizes and makes minor revisions to the North Korea Human Rights Act of 2004. That law captured the strong, bipartisan consensus in favor of promoting human rights, transparent humanitarian assistance, and refugee protections for the people of North Korea. 
   The people of North Korea continue to suffer some of the worst conditions imaginable. The totalitarian regime does not permit meaningful political freedom, nor religious liberty, and requires cult-like devotion to the Kim dynasty. It crushes any who dare to dissent. 
   The vast North Korean gulag holds an estimated 200,000 men, women and children in brutal, sub-human conditions where entire families are tortured, abused and worked to death. 
   The centrally directed economy that exacerbated the North Korean famine of the 1990s, which killed somewhere between 1 and 3 million people, continues to threaten the basic welfare of the population. 
   The scores of North Korean women and girls who flee into China are vulnerable to repeated trafficking, sexual abuse, and exploitation. If they are pregnant when repatriated, they are routinely subjected to forced abortions by North Korean officials, often by vicious, physical beatings. 
   Trying to sweep the refugee problem under the rug before the 2008 Olympics, China has dramatically raised the bounty that it pays for North Korean border crossers, and routinely repatriates refugees to North Korea where they are sure to face prison, torture, and sometimes even execution. 
   In an attempt to deter escape, the North Korean regime has been stepping up its executions of people involved in border crossings. They execute them at public gatherings, where attendance by the local population, including children, is required.     
   On February 20 of this year, North Korean officials in Onsung County made their point by shooting and killing 13 women in front of the assembled community. Tragically, these atrocities are common in North Korea. We should, therefore, not be surprised when a dictatorship so willing to brutalize its own people is proven untrustworthy and dangerous in its dealings with the outside world. 
   Whether the issue is human rights, missiles or nuclear proliferation, the only consistent interest of the current North Korean regime is the continuation of the current North Korean regime. It holds no value and no regard  for human life or the welfare of humanity as a whole. 
   In an effort to help address the grim situation endured by the North Korean people, this bill extends key authorities of the original North Korean Human Rights Act for an additional 4 years, such as funding for humanitarian assistance to North Korean refugees and trafficking victims, efforts to increase freedom of information inside North Korea, support for democracy and human rights activities, and reporting requirements regarding implementation of this act. 
   It also attempts to energize the United States' anemic North Korean refugee admissions, and clarifies and strengthens the role of the Special Envoy, which Congress intended to be a full-time position within the Department of State to champion better policy making on North Korean human rights, humanitarian, and refugee issues. 
   The United States is home to the largest ethnic Korean community outside of the Korean Peninsula, and many of our 2 million Korean-American constituents have family ties to North Korea. Our Nation also has the largest refugee resettlement program in the world by far and has resettled approximately 150,000 refugees from around the world since the year 2004, when the act became law. But over the past 4 years, Mr. Speaker, the United States has settled fewer than 50 North Koreans, notwithstanding the clear mandate of section 303 of the act directing the Secretary of State to facilitate North Korean refugee applications. This is an embarrassment, and it is not in keeping with the intent of Congress in passing the North Korean Human Rights Act. 
   More North Koreans have approached the United States seeking resettlement, but many have been deterred or have abandoned their pursuit because of extended delays that sometimes continue even after they have passed U.S. security screening. A group of increasingly desperate North Korean refugees, some of whom have been awaiting U.S. resettlement for over 2 years, recently carried out a hunger strike to draw attention to their extended limbo. This situation, which continues despite the good work from our regional refugee coordinators, requires persistent, high-level diplomacy by senior executive branch officials to secure permission from more foreign countries to allow us to process refugees, and prompt exit visas when those North Koreans are ready to leave for the United States. 
   I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Berman, and our original cosponsors from both sides of the aisle for their commitment to this important issue, including my friend, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, whose language on North Korean refugees in China was added to section 3 of the bill. 
   I urge unanimous consent for this measure. And I hope that we can work together to get this bill through to the other body and onto the President's desk. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand also in support of House Resolution 1181 authored by my good friend from New York (Mr. Crowley), and which I am proud to cosponsor, that addresses the tragic loss of life in Burma due to the devastation of the recent cyclone. 
   The suffering caused there is heart wrenching, with the number of estimated dead nearing 100,000, and with at least 1 million people left homeless. 
   The secretive and corrupt military junta in Burma has made a determination of exact figures on the loss of life and of those in desperate need of assistance nearly impossible to estimate. Millions are reportedly at immediate risk of disease or hunger. 
   Many have publicly criticized the Burmese regime in the cyclone's aftermath, pointing out that Burma's state-run radio failed to issue a timely warning to its citizens in the storm's path, despite information it received from neighboring countries. 
   United Nations agencies temporarily suspended relief flights last week after reports that the junta had impounded two plane loads of supplies and that the Burmese troops were pilfering the assistance already on the ground. What kind of regime steals the food literally out of the mouths of starving babies? The answer is the one in Burma today. 
   The first U.S. relief aircraft, loaded with 28,000 pounds of supplies, including water, mosquito netting and blankets, was allowed to land in Burma on Monday. This is in keeping with the wide-hearted generosity of the American people to those who are in need anywhere in the globe. It is in keeping with Ronald Reagan's famous dictum that ``a hungry child knows no politics.'' 
   Disaster relief experts from the United States and other countries are ready to head to Burma to prevent what could become an even greater calamity affecting millions of people. The Burmese regime, however, is still refusing to issue them visas. 
   The insistence by the junta that it will distribute all supplies itself raises grave concerns, given the regime's past track record of thievery and indifference to the welfare of its own people. It is time for Burma to let the relief workers and journalists inside. The generals must put aside, for once, their own selfish ambitions and must start thinking of the good of their own people. The prospects for this, however, remain grim. This is, after all, the same regime that callously shot monks and other peaceful demonstrators on the streets of Burma's cities last fall during the Saffron Revolution. The generals, unfortunately, are likely to turn a deaf ear to the cries of their own people. 
   This Congress, however, should not and must not be deaf to the cries of the suffering men, women and children in Burma. It is essential that the House speak today in a strong and unified voice and pass Mr. Crowley's important resolution. The American people would expect no less, and the Burmese people will be forever grateful. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) be allowed to manage the remainder of our time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND ARMS EXPORT CONTROL REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I also rise in strong support of H.R. 5916, the Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Reform Act of 2008. Among this legislation's provisions is language I offered which was incorporated into the original text regarding North Korea's nuclear programs and the ongoing Six-Party talks. 
   We have heard in recent days about North Korea's hand-over of 18,000 pages of so-called logs concerning its plutonium extraction activity at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. However, let's not be fooled yet again by North Korea or by those seeking an agreement with this regime at any and all costs. 
   These logs, according to many regional and nonproliferation experts, do not mark any substantive progress towards nuclear disarmament. For starters, the reporting is limited to North Korea's plutonium-based nuclear facilities and not the totality of its nuclear weapons program as called for under the February 2007 Six-Party agreement whereby North Korea commits to completely disarming itself in exchange for certain concessions from the West. 
   To address these important issues, the language I drafted, which was incorporated into title III of the bill before us, clarifies and reinforces the conditions that North Korea must meet before it can be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and before related sanctions can be removed. No new conditions have been added. However, this bill does specify that North Korea must take verifiable actions regarding all of its nuclear activities before such an important concession is granted to this duplicitous regime. 
   These requirements, Mr. Speaker, include ceasing to provide nuclear assistance to countries such as Syria and Iran, providing a complete and correct declaration of all of its nuclear programs, and in addition to U.S. verification, agreeing to the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency in monitoring and verifying the shutdown and sealing of the nuclear facility at Yongbyon. 
   Given North Korea's abysmal record in keeping its promises, verification of its declarations and actions is of central importance to any agreement. For that reason, this bill also contains language in title III that requires the State Department to submit a report to the committee describing the methods and actions that the U.S. will use to verify North Korea's declarations regarding its nuclear facilities, describing all formal and informal agreements regarding verification, and documenting any objections regarding these measures that have been expressed by North Korea. 
   This bill also strengthens U.S. national security interests and assistance to our strong ally, Israel. It requires the administration to perform an ongoing assessment of Israel's qualitative military edge and authorizes an increase in U.S. Foreign Military Financing that is consistent with the August 2007 U.S.-Israel memorandum on military assistance. 
   These provisions are of vital importance because, as we all know, Israel is surrounded by a multitude of threats which threatens its very survival. Radical Islamic jihadists in Gaza are continuing to launch large numbers of powerful, accurate, and deadly rockets at Israel civilians and have smuggled weapons, cash, and armed militants from Egypt through underground tunnels. Palestinian extremists continue to carry out attacks inside Israel itself, including the murder of eight people at a yeshiva in Jerusalem this past March, which included one American. 
   In the aftermath of the summer 2006 war launched by Hezbollah against Israel, this Islamic militant group continues its reign of terror made possible by aid from Iran and Syria, both sworn enemies of Israel, both state sponsors of terrorism, both seeking a nuclear capability, and both receiving support from the regime in North Korea. 
   According to a Congressional Research Service report finalized just last week and prepared at my request, North Korea's relationship with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, an entity involved in proliferation activities and in supporting Islamic extremists, appears to be in two areas: One, coordination and support of Hezbollah; and two, cooperation in ballistic missile development. 
   And turning to Syria, Mr. Speaker, CIA Director Michael Hayden was recently quoted as saying that the nuclear reactor the Syrian regime was building with assistance from North Korea could have produced enough plutonium for one or two nuclear weapons within 1 year of beginning operations. 
   Then there is the growing menace from Iran's radical Islamist regime. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently reminded us that Iran ``is hellbent on acquiring nuclear weapons.'' As it aggressively pursues the nuclear option, the regime in Tehran still continues to call for Israel to be wiped off the map. 
   Thus, the provisions in this bill enhancing our relationship with Israel are critical to Israel's security and to our own vital interests in the region. This bill also advances U.S. national security and economic competitiveness by including language derived from legislation introduced by Mr. Sherman of California and Mr. Manzullo promoting long-overdue reforms in the licensing of defense exports by the State Department. It also significantly strengthens congressional oversight over a range of issues requiring the Executive Branch to fully consult with our committee before undertaking any actions covered by this legislation. 
   Lastly, drawing upon an initiative led by Mr. Royce of California and strongly supported by Secretary of State Rice, it upgrades the foreign military sales, FMS, status of our staunch ally, the Republic of Korea. The bill also appropriately affords the same status to our close defense relationship with Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a strong, bipartisan effort unanimously adopted by our Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is the appropriate vehicle to address the significant policy changes on North Korea that the administration is requesting. It is my hope and expectation that we allow the legislative process to take its appropriate course and that we will not seek to circumvent the authority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or to undermine this bill by attaching broad waiver language regarding North Korea to either the pending supplemental appropriations bill or the national defense authorization bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this carefully crafted, much needed, and bipartisan legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join with this House today in commemorating a milestone that few would have once thought possible, and in celebrating one of America's most special bilateral relationships. 
   When the State of Israel was declared on May 14, 1948, some worried whether it would survive for even 6 months in the face of ruthless and relentless war from much of the Arab world. Naysayers worldwide fought against the establishment of a state for the Jewish people, and urged the United States not to recognize any such Jewish state. To our Nation's credit, the United States recognized Israel 11 minutes after it declared independence, leading the way for other responsible nations to follow. 
   And despite predictions of gloom and doom, and the strongest efforts of its enemies, Israel did not perish. Indeed, Israel has flourished. Israel won three wars of self-defense on multiple fronts. It has survived not merely for 6 months but for 60 extraordinary years. Through it all, Israel has endured. And as the only democracy in the region, Israel continues to be a beacon of hope and a model for her neighbors. 
   It has been said that the strength of a nation is determined by the caliber of its people. There is perhaps no better example of this truth than the State of Israel and the Israeli people, vivid examples of conviction, of courage, of faith. Indeed, through the blood and the toil and the creativity of its citizens, Israel has grown accustomed to dispelling established wisdom and exceeding expectations. 
   Israel has proven that democracy, liberty, prosperity and innovation can indeed thrive in the Middle East. Today, Israel is a vibrant democracy where unfettered free speech fills the airwaves, and where Arabs serve in government, and have excelled in business and science. 
   Israel has demonstrated that desolate areas of the Holy Land can be redeemed, and that the ``land of milk and honey'' can once again bloom and bear fruit. 
   Israel has given the world a first-rate high-tech industry that pioneered wi-fi and instant messaging, and a medical industry that pioneered microscopic cameras that can be swallowed in a pill. And Israel has shown that a 2,000-year-old dream, the creation of a state for the Jewish people in their historic homeland, can indeed come true. 
   Time and time again, Mr. Speaker, Israel has made the impossible a reality. Yet today, Israel once again finds itself besieged in every direction by dangerous regimes like Iran and Syria and by the rapidly arming and violent Islamic groups that those regimes sponsor like Hamas and Hezbollah. 
   Today, Israelis live in fear, fear of the threat of their very existence represented by the pariah states of Iran and Syria. Innocent blood in Tel Aviv, in Jerusalem, and in other communities is shed regularly as a result of the jihadists from Hezbollah, from Hamas, and other such militant organizations. 
   Palestinian suicide bombers have struck at crowded bus stops, at hotels and cafes and other civilian targets. And in a little town called Sderot, children play indoors because of Palestinian rockets, and ordinary people face the draining pressure that at any moment a rocket could be launched at them, killing or maiming them or their loved ones. 
   Mr. Speaker, Israel's existence is indispensable to advancing America's most basic interests and values. For decades, our two nations have successfully collaborated on everything from science and business to defense and homeland security. As America goes forward, fighting for a free and prosperous world and against violent extremist groups who seek our ruin, Israel once again stands with us. And America will and must continue to stand with Israel for the next 60 years and beyond. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of this resolution which forcefully criticizes the current bloody crackdown that is taking place in Tibet. This resolution also condemns Beijing's almost six decades of suppression of the religious, linguistic, economic, and cultural rights of the people of Tibet. 
   It was my great honor, Madam Speaker, to sponsor legislation which resulted in the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor that we can bestow in the United States Congress, to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, last October. My late friend and colleague from across the aisle, Congressman Tom Lantos, and I worked together to ensure that His Holiness received the official recognition that he so richly deserves. 
   The Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has won the admiration of all of us, not only for his spiritual guidance, but also for his principled stand upholding the human rights of the captive people of Tibet. 
   Beijing's cynical and crass campaign to denigrate His Holiness both inside and outside of Tibet has drawn the anger of both the Dalai Lama's followers, as well as people of good will throughout the globe. Beijing has called His Holiness ``a splittist'' and ``a wolf in monk's clothing.'' The Chinese Embassy even recently sent out a computer link to offices here on Capitol Hill ludicrously comparing His Holiness to Nazis. 
   The people of Tibet can no longer silently bear these continued insults directed at their spiritual leader, a man respected as an advocate of peace, of compassion, and good will. A boiling point was reached on March 10th, the anniversary of the 1959 uprising in Tibet and subsequent flight of the Dalai Lama into exile in India. When demonstrators broke out in Lhasa, Beijing responded with an iron fist. In implementing a bloody crackdown, Beijing ignored its past pledge to the International Olympic Committee to improve the human rights situation in China prior to this summer's Olympics. Chinese authorities even denied foreign diplomats and journalists all access to Tibet. 
   With increasing numbers of American tourists traveling to Tibet every year, the United States has a legitimate interest in having diplomatic access to Tibet for consular services. But there should be no further openings of more Chinese consulates in the United States until China stops its repression of religious and ethnic minorities and stops violating the fundamental human rights of its own citizens. 
   The crackdown continued until April 3, when Chinese troops fired into a peaceful crowd of demonstrators outside a Tibetan temple in southwest China. The crowd had been protesting the arrest of two monks who were found in possession of photographs of the Dalai Lama. Eight were killed, including members of the Buddhist clergy. 
   But the Chinese regime has not only been responsible for shedding innocent Tibetan blood, in Darfur, in Burma, in North Korea, and inside China itself, bloody repression continues unabated.     
   This lack of liberty will further diminish the light of the Olympic torch. The progression of that torch from London and Paris to San Francisco has become a focal point for those who would raise their voices concerning the immense human rights abuses of the Chinese regime. 
   What has begun in Tibet will not stay in Tibet. Already there are reports of unrest among the Uyghur minority as well. Beijing's continued repression and denial of human rights will become the chief focal point of international attention in the summer of the Beijing Olympics. And, Madam Speaker, if the present repression continues, the Beijing games will indeed become the ``Genocide Olympics.'' 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join in vigorous approval and support for this resolution. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that my good friend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) be allowed to manage the remainder of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I rise in strong support today, Mr. Speaker, of H.R. 512, the commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the American Latino Community Act. And I would like to thank my dear friend, Mr. Becerra of California, for his commitment in bringing this important legislation to the floor. We have been working on it for a number of years. It has got strong bipartisan support, and it has been a delight for me to have worked with him and members of my staff to have worked with his staff as well. 
   As the Republican lead on this legislation, I am so pleased that this bill will take the next step in developing a plan of action for an establishment of a National Museum of the American Latino. 
   The commission would be comprised of experts in art and museum administration, as well as individuals with experience in the development of similar cultural institutions. The commission would have the responsibility of examining and reporting to Congress and the President a plan to establish a new national museum. 
   Even as the largest minority group in the United States, Hispanic Americans, are not fully represented by one of the permanent exhibits in Washington's museums, currently there are over 42 million Hispanics in the United States. Furthermore, the Census Bureau estimates that in the year 2050, the Hispanic population in the U.S. will reach over 100 million. 
   As we can see, Hispanic Americans are our country's largest and fastest growing minority group, and they continue to expand and contribute to the greatness of our wonderful country. 
   As the first Hispanic American woman elected to Congress, I am so proud to advance the issues affecting all citizens living in our great country. I have been proud to represent my diverse south Florida constituency for many years now in Congress, and I look forward to a future that is, indeed, bright for individuals across our terrific country. 
   Hispanic Americans are playing an increasing role also in the Nation's economy and in our workforce. For example, according to the Office of Management and Budget, the unemployment rate among the Hispanic community dropped to 4.7, an all-time record low. This statistic demonstrates that the economic policies of lower taxes and less government regulations are working and that all Americans are benefiting from it. 
   The great diversity of ethnicities and nationalities of the many people of the United States is what makes our Nation strong, is what continues to be a home for many different cultures; and this national museum will signify our strong commitment to proudly exhibit America's rich cultural diversity.  
   Therefore, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation to ensure that visitors to our Nation's Capital gain a more complete understanding of who we are as Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 378 introduced by my good friend and colleague from Puerto Rico (Mr. FORTU&#209;O). 
   This resolution commends the humanitarian efforts of Red Cross, Red Crescent and Magen David Adom societies worldwide on the occasion of World Red Cross Red Crescent Day.  
   These organizations and their 97 million volunteers worldwide make invaluable contributions every day. They provide relief and humanitarian assistance to the world's most vulnerable people, alleviating the suffering of citizens afflicted by war, natural disasters and other crises. 
   More than 233 million people worldwide received assistance from Red Cross, Red Crescent and Magen David Adom societies each year. When a tsunami hit southeast Asia in 2005, those societies were there. When hundreds of millions of children require vaccination against measles and others diseases, those societies are there. When the need arises in the future for humanitarian aid and relief, those societies will be there. 
   As a Member of Congress from Florida's 18th District, I have witnessed firsthand the good works of the Red Cross throughout its efforts to help the victims of numerous hurricanes and tropical storms that have afflicted the residents of south Florida. 
   I have also witnessed firsthand, in my numerous trips to Israel, the relief work and the humanitarian assistance that the Magen David Adom has provided to so many, including, tragically, the many innocent victims of terror. 
   Therefore, I am particularly pleased that in 2006, in a long overdue development, the International Committee of the Red Cross officially recognized Magen David Adom as Israel's national aid society. With much appreciation for the good work of Red Cross, Red Crescent and Magen David Adom societies everywhere, I urge the House to adopt House Resolution 378, introduced by my good friend, Mr. FORTU&#209;O.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (HONORING OPERATION SMILE ON ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 208, which recognizes the 25th anniversary of the founding of Operation Smile, a private nonprofit founded by Dr. and Mrs. William Magee of Virginia in 1982. 
   Madam Speaker, the volunteers for Operation Smile provide reconstructive surgery and other health care to needy children in the United States, as well as in developing countries. They particularly help children with a cleft lip or cleft palate, congenital birth defects that occur as frequently as one in every 600 births. 
   Clefts can cause multiple physical and mental health problems for children and adults, including feeding and speech difficulties, ear infections that can lead to deafness, and low self-esteem, as well as alienation from others. 
   Children worldwide need not, and must not, suffer from these health problems simply because they were born with clefts. Surgery in infancy, adolescence or young adulthood can correct clefts and avert resulting medical and psychological difficulties. 
   Sadly, many families who seek medical care and surgery for children born with clefts are turned away, both in the United States and abroad, due to lack of funds or shortages of medically trained professionals who can provide the care that these children urgently need. 
   Fortunately, the outstanding medical professionals at Operation Smile have, for a quarter of a century, volunteered their time and effort to help save these children and their families. They have provided free reconstructive surgeries to over 100,000 children and young adults in this country and worldwide. They educate and train thousands of health care professionals across the globe. Just as importantly, they are developing future generations of volunteers for this noble cause. 
   Young men and women at more than 450 Operation Smile student associations in the United States and abroad are fund-raising, building awareness and encouraging their fellow students to take charge, to lead and to volunteer their time to help others. In all of these ways, these volunteers demonstrate the potential that volunteers and nonprofits have to change lives, to tackle global problems and to significantly improve the world around them. 
   Because of their 25 years of service, many children and young adults who were born with cleft lip or palate can look at themselves in the mirror with pride, and so can volunteers at Operation Smile. 
   This resolution, offered by my good friend and colleague from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) sends the right message by recognizing and encouraging outstanding volunteers and achievements in the private and the nonprofit sector. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge the House to adopt this resolution, H. Res. 208.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2293, which would require the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a report on efforts to bring to justice the Palestinian terrorists who killed three Americans on October 15, 2003. 
   I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of John Branchizio, Mark T. Parson, and John Marin Linde, Jr., and all United States citizens who have been victimized by the incessant Palestinian terrorist attacks. 
   These three brave Americans were murdered while accompanying United States diplomats who were going to interview young Palestinians for the opportunity to study in this great country on Fulbright scholarships, offering those youth a chance for a better life. 
   While I am sickened by this deplorable act, I am surprised that for far too long our State Department and the Palestinian Authority have done little to bring the murderers of these Americans to justice. These families and others who have lost loved ones should not have their grief compounded by the lack of justice from our own system. 
   The virtual impunity afforded the certain terrorists sends the wrong foreign policy signal, not only to the American people and our allies in the region, but to the terrorists themselves. Recently, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas established an emergency government in the West Bank, with an independent, Salem Fayyad as Prime Minister. Abbas and Fayyad have made statements opposing terrorism, violence and militia rule that pervades both the West Bank and Gaza. But they must follow up their words with actions. 
   Not only do Abbas and Fayyad need to crack down on terrorism and dismantle all militias within the West Bank, but they must locate, detain, and turn over to U.S. custody the murderers of John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde so that they can be charged and brought to justice in an American court. They cannot fulfill their responsibility for stopping terrorism in the future without taking action against those who have perpetrated terrorism in the past. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a great responsibility to those Americans who have lost their lives to Palestinian terror. Therefore, our government should consider conditioning any aid to the West Bank emergency government upon that government showing concrete actions in resolving this case. We must end the message that we as a country are fully committed in our resolve to investigate and prosecute the murder of innocent Americans abroad. 
   Again, I strongly condemn the attack on United States citizens by Palestinian terrorists and reiterate our demands that the administration do more to bring their killers to justice.  
   H.R. 2293 is a major step in the right direction, and I am proud to have cosponsored it. For their leadership in introducing this bill, I thank my good friends and colleagues, the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Pence. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (COMMENDING THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO FOR ENACTMENT OF A LAW TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF MARRIED WOMEN -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from California, Ambassador Watson, for introducing this important resolution, House Resolution 294, which commends the Kingdom of Lesotho for enacting a law to improve the legal status of married women. 
   Historically, a married woman in this African country was considered a minor under the law, and, as such, was unable to enter into contracts without her husband's consent and was severely restricted in economic activities and had no legal standing in the courts. This was the case, despite that women have traditionally borne a disproportionate share of responsibility for the health, the welfare, and the education of the family in Lesotho. 
   They are in the fields, in the markets, in the classrooms, and in the clinics. They run the home and provide the food, care and education essential for the survival of their families. Women serve as the backbone of society in Lesotho. Yet under the law, they have been considered only half a person. 
   Obviously, this was a grave social injustice that required remedy. I commend those in the government and in civil society who began pressing for greater gender equality in Lesotho as early as 1992. 
   But it is important to realize that gender inequality in Lesotho, and throughout Africa, is not just an issue of human rights. This is a development issue and an issue of national security. 
   Over half of the population lives below the poverty level. Yet a government cannot responsibly expect to lift its people out of poverty while legally excluding half of the most productive segment of society from the economy. 
   Further, at 29 percent, Lesotho has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world. Life expectancy already has plummeted to 36 years, and prevalence rates are expected to climb to a staggering 36 percent in the next 15 years. 
   The HIV pandemic is obliterating a generation of the most productive people in Africa. In South Africa, for example, factory managers routinely complain that they have to hire two people to fill a single position due to absentee rates related to HIV. 
   When a man dies, who is left to provide for his family? His wife. But if a wife and a mother cannot secure even basic inheritance rights and has no standing in civil court, then how is she to provide for the next generation? The traditional safety net provided by the extended family has been eroded, and coping mechanisms have been exhausted by the HIV pandemic. 
   Women whose husbands have died are suspected to carry the virus themselves and are often shunned by their extended families and communities. Thus, high death rates associated with HIV/AIDS and gender inequalities are leaving behind a generation of impoverished, disaffected youth who are susceptible to criminal activities and radical acts. 
   In recognition of the links between gender inequality, poverty and HIV/AIDS, the Millennium Challenge Corporation made gender issues a high priority in its negotiations with Lesotho. 
   In a letter to the Government of Lesotho, the CEO of MCC asserted that the potential impact of a development compact between Lesotho and the MCC focusing on public health and sustainable water and private sector development would be undermined if the issues of gender inequality were not addressed. 
   Shortly thereafter, the Parliament passed the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act, which has significantly enhanced the legal standing of women in Lesotho. To its credit, the MCC has provided assistance to support meaningful implementation of the act. 
   I strongly encourage the government of Lesotho to continue demonstrating its commitment to improving gender equality in the interest of human rights, economic development, and national security. I hope that other countries in the region will follow suit.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (PASSPORT BACKLOG REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of Senate bill 966, the Passport Backlog Reduction Act. All of us have heard from our constituents. Millions of Americans are facing unprecedented delays in the processing of their passport applications. As weeks become months, these painful holdups have wrecked long-planned travel, job opportunities, and family obligations for thousands of our fellow citizens. This situation is incomprehensible and inexcusable. Officials should have anticipated and planned for this increased demand when the new travel security requirements were legislated 3 years ago. 
   Furthermore, the State Department has been collecting additional surcharges under authority granted by Congress 1 1/2 years ago for the express purpose of meeting the increased demand for passports. But as we learned at last week's hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee, officials did not adequately prepare for the increased demand that everyone knew would be coming, and there is no good explanation why. 
   At the same time that the planning was botched by their superiors, I want to praise the dedicated and hardworking individuals who have been working on an extended and overtime schedule to address this backlog. Madam Speaker, I am particularly impressed by the men and women of the Miami passport processing center who have maintained their professionalism and their courtesy even in this high pressure situation. 
   The bill before us will help in a limited but an important way to restore the timely passport processing that the American public has every right to expect. By easing certain reemployment restrictions, it will enable retired Foreign Service officers to come back to work on passport and visa processing on more than a part-time basis. It will also allow them to assist with passport fraud investigations which have not kept pace with the dramatic increase in passport applications. 
   Of course, this bill is only a temporary measure that will ease but will not fix the larger problem. Senate bill 966 is no substitute for the budgeting, hiring, and training that must be part of the Department's annual and long-range planning. We appreciate the solemn assurances at last week's hearing that the Departments of State and Homeland Security are now treating these problems with the seriousness that they deserve. I have no doubt that the Committee on Foreign Affairs under Chairman Lantos' leadership will follow up to ensure that the current problems are remedied promptly and avoided in the future. 
   The bill before us, Madam Speaker, is a small part of that remedy and deserves our unanimous support. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this Coast Guard Authorization Bill being considered on the floor today. 
   I have the unique pleasure of representing over 265 miles of pristine Florida coastline--from Miami Beach to Key West. In fact, two of the largest Coast Guard Sectors in the United States, Sector Miami commanded by Captain Karl Schultz and Sector Key West commanded by Captain Scott A. Buschman are located in my Congressional district. As such, ensuring that the brave Coast Guard men and women have the tools they need to effectively patrol our coasts is of utmost concern. 
   I know that with this important mission, my constituents would not be pleased to hear of the lack of state-of-the-art equipment that the Coast Guard has been using to accomplish its goals. 
   Just to highlight the nature of our aging Coast Guard fleet, I can point to the oldest cutter still active. The Storis, still serving today in Alaska, was commissioned before the United States entry into World War II. A ship over 65 years old should not be tasked with protecting against the modem threats that face this great Nation. 
   Compare this to an April 18th article in the St. Petersburg Times where Drug Enforcement Agency officials are quoted as ``scratching their heads over how to combat the latest innovation in drug smuggling: radar-dodging semisubmersible vessels packed with tons of cocaine.'' Determined drug smugglers are using very sophisticated ships and technologies in this cat-and-mouse game and it will become increasingly difficult to prevent their illegal activities if we are not able to modernize our fleet as well. 
   Fortunately, a vital portion of this bill is dedicated to the Coast Guard's Integrated Deepwater System. This is a critical program to modernize and replace the Coast Guard's aging ships and aircraft. The Deepwater Program is the largest acquisition in the history of the Coast Guard and any delay in the passage of this bill would have a serious and negative impact on the security of South Florida and our Nation. 
   We can all agree that these brave men and women deserve the fundamental resources they need. Certainly, without adequate funding the Coast Guard will not be equipped to accomplish their mission. 
   Coast Guard Sector Miami is scheduled to receive the first six Fast Response Cutters in addition to three ISLAND Class patrol boats. As well, Coast Guard Sector Key West is scheduled for delivery of the second six Fast Response Cutters in addition to one ISLAND Class patrol boat. I applaud these efforts and look forward to the continuation of the Deepwater Program. 
   Though this bill is by no means perfect, the urgency of modernizing our fleet and putting these ships in the water and these aircraft in the skies cannot be understated. 
   I urge all Members to recognize the crucial need to protect our Nation by strengthening the United States' oldest continuous seagoing service, the United States Coast Guard.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is truly a shame that the new Democratic leadership has chosen to turn what was a bipartisan, carefully calibrated approach to safeguarding our Nation's security in the aftermath of 9/11 into a partisan political tool. This bill does have some good elements. In fact, a big portion of the foreign policy titles in the bill mirror what is already in law, with some minor additions or recommendations. 
   That said, the bill does raise concern, and it even includes drafting errors that could have been avoided had we on the other side of the aisle had in the committees been allowed to operate and been allowed to contribute to the drafting, but we were not. 
   For example, the Nuclear Black Market section in this bill, Mr. Speaker, is a legislative effort that I had the pleasure of working on with the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) throughout the last few years. 
   However, much has changed. Parts of it need revision. It needs to be reedited and updated. But we will be unable to fix these provisions and make these necessary corrections. 
   Far more troubling, Mr. Speaker, is the profound divergence between our two parties that this legislation reveals. The divergence is clearly most demonstrated in the provisions regarding the Proliferation Security Initiative, known as the PSI. 
   Since its creation by this administration in the year 2002, the PSI has quickly become one of this country's most valuable tools in helping to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction and preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorists. Our PSI partners and others at times have stopped the transshipment of material and equipment bound for Iran's ballistic missiles programs and also prevented Iran from procuring funds and the goods to support its weapons of mass destruction programs, including its nuclear program; and it was PSI cooperation between the U.S., the U.K., and other European partners that began the demise of the Dr. A.Q. Khan network, an action that was also instrumental in convincing the Libyan Government to stop its nuclear weapons and longer-range missile programs. 
   Despite this success, Mr. Speaker, this legislation urges the President to secure a resolution by the United Nations Security Council that would authorize the PSI under international law. We have seen how ineffective the U.N. Security Council has been in compelling Syria to stop its support for terrorist activities in Lebanon, or at least in keeping to its own deadlines regarding Iran's nuclear program. Giving the United Nations the ability to define what is permissible under the PSI will result in the imposition of unpredictable limitations, unpredictable conditions, and unpredictable interpretations and would result in a regulatory straightjacket overseen by the international bureaucracy. 
   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this is disturbing. I need only point out the continuing efforts by Russia and China to hobble the efforts of the United States at the United Nations to apply pressure to Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. If this recommendation were followed, the PSI would be undermined. The problem, however, is far deeper than merely the threat to this vital and proven program. The position of some of my colleagues across the aisle appears to be that the PSI and similar efforts by the United States to defend its citizens against terrorists and other threats require authorization under international law by the United Nations. They believe that these so-called  multilateral regimes are credible substitutes for the efforts of the United States. 
   We must oppose any efforts to substitute action by the U.N. and other international organizations for those of the U.S. Government in carrying out its fundamental responsibility to protect the American people and advance American interests. I know that there are many of my colleagues who are equally concerned that this proposal should be adopted. I know their constituents will be, Mr. Speaker. 
   Therefore, I hope that all of our colleagues carefully think about some of these provisions and that they put partisan politics aside when it comes time to vote on the motion to recommit, a motion that reaffirms a central tenet of the U.S. foreign policy, and that is that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Government to protect the American people. This responsibility must never be surrendered to the United Nations or other multilateral institutions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, the remaining time. 
   We have seen, Mr. Speaker, how ineffectively the United Nations Security Council has been in compelling Syria to stop its support for terrorist activities in Lebanon or at least keeping to its own deadlines regarding Iran's nuclear program. 
   After decades of rampant anti-Americanism at the United Nations, after decades of opposition and obstruction regarding virtually every aspect of U.S. foreign policy, no one can truly believe that the United Nations Security Council would draft its resolutions to advance the interests of the United States or that any U.N. entity would help the U.S. image in the Arab and Muslim world. 
   I need only point to the continuing efforts by Russia and China to hobble U.S. efforts at the U.N. that would seek to apply pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. 
   Let us consider the UNDP, for example. In 2005, as Israel was withdrawing from Gaza, financed by the Palestinian Authority's production of propaganda materials, it included banners, bumper stickers, T-shirts bearing the slogan: ``Today, Gaza; tomorrow, the West Bank and Jerusalem.'' This is the United Nations. 
   This rightly led to protests from then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton who rightly called this funding inappropriate and unacceptable. 
   And we know the record of the UNDP of hostility toward economic freedom. Has anyone really thought this through? This needs to be revamped, and the bill before us does not address that in a correct way to have it be pro-U.S. and pro-U.S. national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, since its creation by this administration in the year 2002, the Proliferation Security Initiative, known as PSI, has quickly become one of this country's most valuable tools in helping to stop spread the weapons of mass destruction and preventing them falling into the hands of terrorist countries. 
   Our PSI partners, working at times with others, have stopped the transshipment of materials and equipment that have been bound for Iran's ballistic missiles programs and also has prevented Iran from procuring goods to support its WMD programs, including its nuclear program. Again, it was PSI cooperation between the United States, Britain and other European partners that began the demise of the Dr. A.Q. Khan network, an action that also contributed to the decision of the Libyan Government to stop and abandon its nuclear weapons and longer-range missile program. 
   However, despite this extraordinary record of success, some of our Democratic colleagues tell us, as noted in the Dear Colleague that they have circulated today, that securing United Nations authorization under international law would persuade countries that are not currently cooperating with us in the United States to prevent this illicit trade in items of proliferation concern to somehow cooperate with us. 
   They dismissed a coalition of the willing, on which the PSI is based as an ad hoc assembly. But the PSI has been a success precisely because it is a coalition of the willing. 
   Countries that might wish to slow or limit its activities have no means of doing so. The fact is that no country that genuinely wishes to cooperate with the United States, another PSI participant, is prevented from doing so. The idea that there is a need for the United Nations to provide legitimacy to the PSI under international law to permit countries to cooperate is nonsense. 
   I do not share the sentiments of my Democratic colleagues who have the surprising faith in the United Nations' desire to advance the interests of the United States. Whether it is Iran, Syria, terrorism, Middle East peace, the U.N. is rarely a help and more often than not a hindrance to the advancement of the goals of the United States. Rather, the desire for consensus, an agreement for agreement's sake, as a result, is a race to the bottom. 
   We have seen this with the so-called Human Rights Council, Mr. Speaker. If we allow the section cited in the motion to remain in the bill, a similar result is likely to happen with PSI. Some of my Democratic colleagues appear to regard U.N. authorization under international law as something upon which U.S. action must be predicated, that it is a higher authority to which we must turn in order to secure authorization for all our actions, a permission which may be granted or held as the U.N. sees fit. 
   We must reject that interpretation. I am certain that many of our constituents do reject it. What troubles me most are statements that begin with the phrase ``international law does not allow.''     
   We on this side of the aisle do not believe that international law controls what the U.S. can and cannot do, what it must do to protect the interests of the American people. That is why I have included language in this motion to recommit stating that simple truth. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield the remaining time to Mr. Wolf of Virginia, a man who understands the failures of the United Nations. And I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this restatement of the fundamental principle upon which our Constitution and the foreign policy of our country is based.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (NAVAL VESSEL TRANSFER ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank my good friend, the chairman of our committee, HOWARD BERMAN. It is a delight to work with him in a bipartisan manner, and I appreciate the close cooperation that we've enjoyed in these months. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7177, a measure to authorize certain naval vessel transfers, to strengthen U.S. security assistance to Israel and to upgrade the foreign military sale status of our allies in the Republic of Korea. Mr. Speaker, this bill contains many provisions identical or similar to those contained a bill previously passed by this House this spring, H.R. 5916, the Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Reform Act of 2008. 
   The bill before us strengthens the U.S. commitment to the security of our dear friends in Israel by requiring an objective analysis of Israel's military capability with respect to conventional and unconventional threats while authorizing an increase in U.S. foreign military financing that is consistent with the August 2007 U.S.-Israel memorandum on military assistance. These provisions are of vital importance because as we all know, Israel is surrounded by a number of threats which threaten its very survival. 
   Thus, the provisions in this bill enhancing our relationship with Israel are critical to Israel's security but also to our vital interests in the region. 
   This legislation also upgrades the Foreign Military Sales status of our staunch ally, the Republic of Korea. Elements of this provision were included in H.R. 5443 which passed the House earlier this week. This upgrade is an important symbol of a renewed and transformed U.S.-ROK alliance. It reaffirms that South Korea continues to be a close and a much-valued strategic ally of the United States in a relationship that is, and must remain, a bedrock of stability in Northeast Asia. 
   Mr. Speaker, our actions here tonight will help to advance a new strategic framework for the alliance, not only for the purpose of managing a range of North Korea contingencies, but also to cement a common, democratic partnership for the 21st century. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the grant of surplus Navy vessels. According to our Secretary of the Navy, these proposed transfers would improve our political and military relationship with these countries.     
   The United States would also incur no cost in transferring these vessels, as the recipients would be responsible for all costs associated with the transfers. 
   I urge support for this important measure, Mr. Speaker. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 337, which honors Seeds of Peace on its 15th anniversary. We in Congress and all people of goodwill worldwide want to see peace, stability and security prevail in the Middle East, and indeed in all regions of conflict. However, that goal remains illusive when leaders act in ways that distort, perpetuate and aggravate otherwise resolvable disputes between nations and peoples. 
   Such leaders make peace impossible by programming their citizens into viewing other nations and other people as wicked, inhumane and worthy of hatred and death. The most obvious example of this phenomenon is the unceasing dissemination by Arab countries of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda. Children in the Arab world and Iran are taught using textbooks and official media to hate Israel, to hate the Jews and to forfeit their own lives in order to kill as many Israelis and Jews as possible. 
   Fortunately, Seeds of Peace has spent 15 years bringing together youth from the Middle East and other conflict-torn regions and encouraging them to engage their peers as fellow human beings worthy of respect and tolerance. Programs like Seeds of Peace cultivate the young leaders who can oppose violent extremism and hateful propaganda, who can promote a culture of life and seek peaceful, rational and mutually beneficial solutions to seemingly intractable conflicts. 
   Mr. Speaker, given that Seeds of Peace is devoted to promoting peaceful resolution of the world's most dangerous conflicts, it is important to note that the allocation of vital and scarce resources contributes to conflicts around the globe. In the Middle East, oil and natural gas resources enable many authoritarian governments to resist reform and to finance destabilizing actions, including weapons programs and sponsorship of Islamic jihadists. Therefore, it is especially important for our national security and for the cause of peace worldwide for the United States to stop our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   I thank my good friend and colleague from Maine (Mr. Allen) for introducing this Seeds of Peace anniversary resolution. I urge the House to adopt it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF SANITATION -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 318, authored by my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Payne). 
   Lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation are indeed some of the most pressing environmental public health issues in the world. Today, an estimated 2.6 billion people, including almost 1 billion children, live without access to basic sanitation facilities. Every 20 seconds, a child dies as a direct result. 
   In fact, it is estimated that nearly half the developing world suffers from preventable diseases associated with the lack of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene. Without sufficient access to these services, countries, communities and families become susceptible to and are often defenseless against life-threatening diseases and infections which perpetuate this horrible cycle of poverty. 
   As this resolution notes, sanitation improves health. It saves lives. It protects the environment. It improves economies. And it contributes to human dignity and social development. It is imperative that the United States and the international community work together to achieve the goals of the Millennium Development Account and significantly reduce the number of people suffering from a lack of sanitation and clean water. 
   Another pressing issue is one that underscores the potentially grave future that we may face if we don't immediately address rising energy costs and find alternative sources of energy to carry out our daily tasks, some critical tasks such as the energy required to filter our water supply. This resolution also reminds us, however, that necessity is the mother of invention, and that human beings have the potential to achieve any task necessary to improve living conditions. 
   How does it remind us of this? In Africa, for example, where there are areas that lack consistent and dependable sources of oil to produce electricity, they must develop and rely on alternative methods, sometimes primitive ones, such as fire for boiling water to avoid disease. Again, in the most remote region of the world, we are thinking of alternative sources and alternative methods. We here must also think and seek alternative clean energy. Will we wait until circumstances are so dire that American will be forced to boil their water in their backyards to conserve the little energy available because we failed to develop alternative sources today? 
   Just as we seek to foster ingenuity in the developing world to provide greater access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation in resource-poor settings, we must foster such ingenuity in our own energy sector. 
   I thank Chairman Payne for introducing this timely resolution which highlights the important issues of clean water, sanitation and hygiene. And I urge my colleagues to fully support House Concurrent Resolution 318. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the Merida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008. 
   Based on co-responsibility and cooperation, the Merida Initiative creates an invaluable partnership between the United States, Mexico, the rest of  Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic to work together to fight illicit drugs and organized crime. It is a historic opportunity, an essential collaboration between all of our countries to present a united front against the drug cartels and the gangs who callously threaten the safety and future of our communities every day. 
   The growing operational and financial capabilities of these groups pose a clear and present threat to the lives and well-being of our citizens. By supporting this authorization, we are supporting the goals of the Merida Initiative to confront these dangers. Furthermore, we are supporting the goals of our friends in Mexico, Central America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic to combat these dangers as well. 
   The Merida Initiative, as considered under this authorization, is a comprehensive program focused on strengthening democratic institutions, on bolstering law enforcement capabilities, on supporting local communities, and on promoting human rights at all levels of the Initiative's implementation. 
   For years, drug traffickers and organized crime have used a regional strategy to carry out their illicit activities. Now, under the Merida Initiative, we have a chance for our governments to join forces and match this transnational approach. In Mexico, President Calderon has deployed nearly 30,000 soldiers and federal police to the country's most dangerous drug trafficking hotspots. 
   In Guatemala, the government has announced plans to send hundreds of troops, elite presidential guards and antidrug police to its northern border to stem the growing violence. 
   In the United States, our law enforcement agents have been met with increasing hostile actions while working to preserve the security of our borders. 
   The Merida Initiative enables us to combine all of these efforts to capitalize on all of our strength and confront narcotraffickers and organized crime with the same determination that they so vigorously employ to wreak havoc on our communities. 
   I was pleased to see that both the House and Senate versions of the supplemental included funding to support the Merida Initiative. I am hopeful that the conferees will look at this bill for direction when determining the final face of the Merida Initiative. I believe that it offers an effective guide for ensuring U.S. interest, while respecting our partners' sovereignty. 
   For too long, narcotraffickers and organized crime have run free, plaguing the prosperity of our region. By supporting the Merida Initiative, we are making the way for democracy and for development to take hold, and addressing the precursor conditions that help breed instability in the region, and that help create fertile territory even for Islamic extremist recruitment. 
   Madam Speaker, again I rise in full support of this initiative, and I look forwarding to helping to enhance our Nation's security by fighting and overcoming these daily threats. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would like to point to the testimony that was given by an official of the Department of Homeland Security when he testified on the importance for the United States of the Merida Initiative, because this is not a bill for Mexico. This is not a legislative bill for Central America. This is not for Haiti. This is not for the Dominican Republic. This is for the United States citizens. This is to protect our homeland from these vicious gangs and these drug dealers. 
   As this gentleman said, rather than simply giving money to foreign governments, the Merida Initiative has been tailored to provide our foreign partners with the specific tools they each need to fight transnational organized crime and work cooperatively with us in the United States. This is a bill that will help our communities, our country, our national security and our children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the positive relationship enjoyed by the United States and Great Britain is certainly historic, enduring and merits recognition, and it merits nurturing, we should also be focusing our time and debating policies to address the rising energy costs that are facing our Nation. 
   Nevertheless, we have this resolution before us marking the 225th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris of 1783 between the United States and the United Kingdom. The great British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the first to refer to the alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom as a special relationship. In a speech he delivered in 1946, he was right to use that term. 
   The American British relationship is, indeed, special, with its foundation lying in the common values of freedom, democracy and human rights. Our mutual commitments to those principles have led the United States and Great Britain to stand side by side on the beaches of Normandy, at the Berlin wall, in the mountains of Afghanistan, and in those the parts of Iraq where the challenges today are greatest. 
   The murderous terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in America, and on July 7, 2005, in Britain, have bound America and Britain even closer together in our determination to defeat extremism. 
   During his recent visit to the United States, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown reaffirmed our strong relationship saying, ``I continue to stand shoulder to shoulder [with the US] in the fight where freedom and justice are at risk.'' 
   By adopting the resolution before us, we will again recognize the history of our special relationship with Britain, a relationship that ironically began with the revolution of one against the other, but that came into its full strength because of the values and the ideals that our two people have continued to share. 
   Now, 225 years after the treaty of peace, in which Britain recognized the independence of the United States of America, that alliance between our two countries takes its guidance from the speech in 1946 in which Mr. Churchill noted our special relationship, and here is what he said then: 
   If there is to be a fraternal association ..... with all the extra strength and security which both our countries can derive from it, let us make sure that that great fact is known to the world, and that it plays its part in steadying and stabilizing the foundations of peace. There is the path of wisdom. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join supporting this resolution which follows Mr. Churchill's advice and lets the world know that the United States and the United Kingdom, indeed, have a strong and continuing relationship. I am not sure what Winston Churchill would say about today's high energy costs, but I bet that he would have a detailed plan to help us bring our costs down. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 332, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
   As we reflect on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the gross violators such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, we cannot help but think about how these repressive governments manipulate international oil flows to keep us at their mercy. 
   We must reduce our reliance on these unstable foreign energy sources, and the way to do that, Mr. Speaker, is by finding alternatives to oil dependence. The U.S. should lead the way; yet we're stuck in the past as our global competitors are indeed pursuing 21st century technologies. We must commit ourselves to a comprehensive energy reform policy that will improve energy efficiency and encourage investment in ground-breaking research and advance alternative and renewable energy technologies. 
   Much like the situation we're facing on human rights at the United Nations, we shouldn't wait 60 years to address the increasing problem of our foreign dependence on oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago and without a dissenting voice in the United Nations General Assembly, we recognized the fundamental human rights to life, to liberty, to freedom of religion, to freedom of expression, to self-government through free elections, to freedom from slavery and torture and so many other basic rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the product of remarkable international consensus, and it captured the distilled conscience of the world in one of the United Nations' finest moments. 
   It was not an international law or covenant, and it did not claim to be creating the rights that it included. Rather, its purpose was to serve as a common standard of achievement for all peoples that is premised on faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person. 
   We are fortunate and, indeed, truly blessed to live in a country whose constitutional heritage has served to secure those aspirations for all of America's people. But for so many people in the world, the ideals of the universal Declaration are nothing more than an unkept promise. 
   In Burma, in Cuba, North Korea and Zimbabwe, and many other Nations, people suffer at the hands of self-seeking tyrants and brutal dictatorships. Millions of others endure the scourges of human trafficking, of religious persecution, and other offenses against human dignity. 
   For those reasons, the universal declaration remains a valuable touchstone, and the United States remains committed to promoting the values that it espouses. 
   For this anniversary, however, it is also a sad opportunity to reflect on how far the United Nations and its human rights bodies have fallen from the lofty aspirations of the original declaration. 
   The United Nations Human Rights Council, formed to replace the discredited United Nations Human Rights Commission, has devolved into an offensive farce even worse than its predecessor. 
   The Council embraces some of the world's most notorious human rights abusers as its members and has ignored genuine human rights advocacy in favor of a relentless, single-minded attack on the democratic, freedom-loving, multi-party State of Israel. In its session in March, the Council passed more resolutions against Israel than against Burma, North Korea, and Sudan combined, and it failed to comment at all on abuses by Iran, Cuba or Uzbekistan. 
   The Council recently elected Jean Ziegler, a man who has compared Israel to Nazis, and approved a notorious Israel basher as the new Special Rapporteur on Israel and the Palestinian territories, Mr. Speaker. The Council approved this mandate in the very same session that it discontinued its observation of the Congo where rape is used as a weapon against women and children. 
   In December 1948, Mr. Speaker, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1 year and 2 weeks after it adopted a resolution creating the Jewish State that became Israel. It is both tragic and offensive that extremists have been allowed to hijack the U.N. human rights apparatus and turn the United Nations' noblest intentions into a weapon against a democratic country. 
   It is my hope that the United Nations can somehow recover its moral foundation and credibly place the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights back at the center of its operations.     
   Human dignity and American values demand no less. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the author of this resolution. 
   MR. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute today to a pre-eminent achievement of 20th century statesmanship, an example of U.S. leadership in the quest for securing fundamental dignity for all human persons. 
   I would also like to thank Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and her staff, as well as Chairman Berman and Mr. Payne, my subcommittee chairman, as well for their work in bringing this important resolution before the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was on December 10, 1948 that the memory of a brutal world war, which took over tens of millions of lives, scarred millions of survivors of an unimaginable holocaust, and unleashed the full fury of atomic power on the guilty as well as the innocent, remained vividly etched in the world's collective consciousness that led to this important moment. 
   In view of this unprecedented devastation, and in the hope of preventing future conflict, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed a Universal Declaration of Human Rights as ``a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.'' And it also recognized that ``the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' 
   As the memory of World War II fades and recedes into history, it becomes ever clearer to me that our rapidly changing world appears to be losing sight of the guiding principles that have accompanied the promotion of human dignity, peace and prosperity since the earliest progression of civilization. I also believe we are living in a day when the myriad of distractions of modern life in the United States leave precious little time for philosophical reflection upon the foundations which have guided this Nation through many turbulent times. 
   To draw attention to these important principles and the pivotal role of the United States in bringing the Universal Declaration to fruition, I was pleased, along with Mr. Delahunt, to introduce this resolution to recognize the 60th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights. It is my hope that this effort will serve as a vivid reminder of the profound contributions of the United States throughout our short history as a champion of human rights around the world, of the work that is left to be done, and inspire thoughtful reflection on the transcended principles of human dignity.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, extending the existing Andean Trade Preference Act for Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador through 2008 is a necessary measure, but one that only goes halfway. It cannot substitute for passage of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which is of central importance in defending critical U.S. strategic interests in the region. 
   Colombia has been an indispensable ally in the fight to keep drugs off American streets, and it has successfully battled armies of narcoterrorists even as it has consolidated its democracy. It is a steadfast partner in an increasingly unstable region where enemies of the United States and strategic competitors are making rapid advances. 
   But the strongest argument for the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is that although it would benefit Colombia enormously, it would benefit the United States even more. Those opposed to the Colombia FTA do not understand that the existing trade preferences give Colombian businesses easy access to U.S. markets but do nothing about giving U.S. businesses greater access to Colombia's markets. 
   Madam Speaker, only the free trade agreement can do that. Let us pass it soon.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1270, which commends the efforts of those who sought to block an international arms transfer destined for Zimbabwe, and calls for an arms embargo against the Mugabe regime. 
   There was a time when Robert Mugabe spoke persuasively about an independent Zimbabwe governed by majority rule and inspired millions. 
   And when Zimbabwe finally won its independence, Mugabe was hailed as a liberator and a hero. 
   But at some point over the past 28 years, the vision of a peaceful, democratic Zimbabwe became distant and grossly distorted. 
   As early as 1982, Mugabe unleashed his infamous North Korean-trained 5th Brigade to crush an uprising in the Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, and slaughtered an estimated 20,000 of his ethnic rivals. 
   Later in 2005, the regime launched ``Operation Clear out the Trash,'' destroying nearly 100,000 housing structures and depriving an estimated 700,000 people of their homes, livelihoods, or both during Zimbabwe's harsh winter. 
   The Mugabe regime has become a brutal kleptocracy, content to rule by the barrel of the gun, while the people of Zimbabwe struggle to survive. 
   Clearly, he has had a lot of practice. 
   Zimbabwe's disputed elections of 2000, 2002, and 2005, were all marred by substantial levels of state-sponsored violence, political repression, voter intimidation, vote-rigging and other forms of manipulation by the ruling ZANU-PF party. 
   That pattern not only continued, but also accelerated in the run-up to the elections of March 29th. 
   According to the State Department's 2007 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Mugabe regime, ``engaged in the pervasive and systematic abuse of human rights, which increased significantly [in 2007] ..... state-sanctioned use of excessive force increased ..... and security forces tortured members of the opposition, student leaders, and civil society activists.'' 
   The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum documented 586 incidents of torture, 855 incidents of assault, and 19 incidents of politically-motivated abductions and kidnappings in 2007 alone. 
   On April 19, 2008, Human Rights Watch reported that the Mugabe regime had established a network of informal detention centers to beat, torture, and intimidate political opponents and other civilians, 
   In the days following the March 29th elections, reports of violent political repression, illegal farm invasions, and, other gross violations of human rights by security forces and ruling party supporters increased at alarming rates. 
   In a report issued earlier this month, Human Rights Watch details the systematic campaign of terror unleashed by the regime ``in an effort to destroy the opposition and ensure that Mugabe wins the presidential runoff elections on June 27, 2008.'' 
   In one incident, the report quotes soldiers threatening a group of villagers by saying, ``If you vote for MDC in the presidential runoff election, you have seen the bullets, we have enough for each one of you, so beware.'' 
   So when a Chinese ship arrived at the port city of Durban, South Africa, reportedly carrying 3 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades, and 3,000 mortar bombs and tubes for the Zimbabwean Defense Force in early April, observers were understandably concerned. 
   But before the international community even knew about the potential arms transfer, the dock and freight workers of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union had taken matters into their own hands. 
   Determined not to contribute to the brutal suppression of opposition voices in Zimbabwe, the dock and freight workers courageously refused to offload or transport the weapons. 
   The International Transport Workers' Federation, the Congress of Southern African Trade Unions (COSATU), religious leaders and other advocates quickly expressed their solidarity with the workers and launched a campaign calling for an international boycott of the vessel. 
   Before long, the governments of South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania reportedly were compelled to deny the ship permission to dock at their ports. 
   Zambian President and Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chairman Levy Mwanawasa publically praised their actions and appealed to all 14 SADC member nations to block the shipment. 
   The heroic efforts of the dock and freight workers, southern African trade unions, religious leaders, advocacy groups and southern African Governments to block the arms shipment deserve recognition and praise of the highest order. 
   Through their valor and steadfastness, these courageous individuals may ultimately save countless lives from Mugabe's reign of terror. 
   It is now incumbent upon all responsible nations to stand in solidarity with the governments and people of southern Africa, and to deny this murderous regime the means to continue oppressing its people. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 1270, which commends those who boldly acted to block a shipment of weapons from China to Zimbabwe, and calls for an international moratorium on any future transfers until the current political crisis has been resolved. 
   I particularly call upon my colleagues who support strengthened ties between the United States and China to convey to their friends in Beijing that their continued engagement with the Mugabe regime can provide no tangible benefit. 
   Continuing the shipment of weapons to Zimbabwe at this time only makes them complicit in the campaign of terror and intimidation that has been unleashed upon the Zimbabwean people. 
   If China wishes to mend its tarnished image, denying weapons sales to known perpetrators of human rights violations might be a good place to start.

Carter Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' is a great honor not just to the family and to the legacy that Bruce left, but also it honors the selfless sacrifice of all of our members and all of our veterans. 
   Bruce was born in New York, and he moved with his family to Texas, then Louisiana, and then they settled in South Florida. He attended Miami Springs Elementary School and then Miami Springs High School before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps in Jacksonville, Florida. He was promoted to Private First Class January 1, 1969, and deployed to Vietnam in April of that year, serving as a radio operator with Hotel Company, 2nd battalion, 3rd Marines, 3rd Marine Division. 
   Sadly, his hopes, his dreams, his lifelong ambitions were brutally cut short in Vietnam. On August 7, 1969, in combat north of the Vandegrift base in the Quang Tri province, Private First Class Carter threw himself on an enemy grenade, giving his life in service to our country so that his fellow Marines could survive. 
   His sacrifice embodies the honor, the courage, and the commitment to freedom which is characteristic of both a hero and a United States Marine. 
   On September 19, 1971, at a ceremony attended by his mother, Georgianna ``Georgie'' Carter-Krell and other family members, Private First Class Carter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his unwavering patriotism and sacrifice. For his valor Private First Class Carter has also received the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one Bronze Star, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. 
   However, the legacy of Private First Class Bruce Carter's commitment to our Nation endures. It endures in his mother, Georgie, who has carried on her son's legacy through her leadership in an organization known as the Gold Star Mothers organization. Today Georgie is serving her second term as national president of Gold Star Mothers, an organization committed to paying tribute to the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of liberty. 
   I am privileged to represent the 18th Congressional District of Florida, hometown to many servicemen and women who have bravely defended our interests every day. My husband, Dexter, served our country in Vietnam as a U.S. Army ranger and was severely wounded in combat. My stepson Doug and his wife are captains in the U.S. Marine Corps, having served our country in Iraq. And I am deeply and personally interested in all of the affairs related to veterans to make sure that we honor them with the benefits that they so richly have earned through their sacrifice. They have served our country proudly, and they deserve to be treated with great respect. 
   Those who dedicated their lives to the service of others truly embody the heart and the spirit of all that is best in America. And that can truly be said of Private First Class Carter, of his dedication to freedom and of his fellow Marines, and it must never be lost in the dusty pages of our history book. Through the naming of this medical center, we will be remembering not just Bruce's sacrifice but the sacrifice and service of all of the brave men and women who proudly serve and wear our Nation's uniform. 
   I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for this opportunity, and I especially want to thank the ranking member, my good friend from Indiana, for this time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from Indiana, the ranking member of Veterans' Affairs, for this time. 
   I am so honored to be here tonight congratulating our good friend, Mr. Miller of Florida, for this bill, and Congressman Bilirakis, another Florida colleague, for speaking on this bill as well. 
   I rise in strong support of House Resolution 4264 to rightfully name the Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center in Tampa, Florida as the ``Michael Bilirakis Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center.'' 
   I had the honor and the pleasure of serving with Congressman Mike Bilirakis here in the House for almost 17 years. He was a colleague, a statesman, a fellow Floridian. Mike was and continues to be a strong voice for our country's men and women proudly serving our country. He was also an advocate for Florida's environment, including the protection of our pristine coastlines. But his time here in the House was truly defined by his supreme dedication to veterans, serving on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for his entire tenure in the U.S. House. 
   After 24 years in Congress, this fine public servant retired in 2006. However, we all have the wonderful pleasure to serve with his son, Gus Bilirakis, and I'm honored to serve with Gus on our Foreign Affairs Committee. We're delighted to see him follow in his father's footsteps in his passion for our veterans. 
   Naming this Department of Veterans Affairs after Congressman Mike Bilirakis is certainly a sound tribute to a man who gave so much to his community, to our brave service men and women, and indeed, to our country. 
   I urge all Members to vote in favor of this resolution that rightfully honors a man such as Congressman Mike Bilirakis, a friend to all, and especially to our veterans.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (ESTABLISHING AN EARNED IMPORT ALLOWANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker the most important argument in favor of the United States-Colombia Free Trade Agreement is that it is manifestly good for the United States and our interests. 
   The most obvious benefit is expanded trade. 
   Opponents claim that the agreement will force the U.S. to remove restrictions on Colombia's exports, resulting in more imports and leading to a loss of jobs and income in the U.S. 
   But these opponents do not understand that, because most of Colombia's exports already enter the U.S. with few or no restrictions, it is Colombia's barriers that will be removed and U.S. exporters that will benefit. 
   And expanded U.S. exports to Colombia translate directly into increased jobs and income here at home. 
   Colombia will certainly benefit, but the U.S. will benefit more. 
   This free trade agreement is about more than economics. It is essential to securing U.S. strategic interests in the Hemisphere. 
   In a region in which anti-American regimes are aggressively targeting U.S. interests, Colombia remains a steadfast ally. 
   That ally is battling an array of internal and external enemies, and the U.S. has an enormous stake in ensuring that Colombia wins that fight. 
   Long under siege from FARC guerrillas who once controlled nearly half the country, Colombia has, in recent months, inflicted major defeats on an armed insurgency that has: sought to overthrow Colombia's democratic government; killed and kidnapped thousands of Colombians, as well as Americans and other foreigners; and provided protection to drug kingpins shipping billions of dollars of cocaine, heroin, and other illegal drugs to the U.S. every year. 
   Colombia looks poised to free itself from these threats and achieve peace and long-term stability. 
   Given the stakes, our friends and enemies in this Hemisphere are watching how we treat this vital ally in the region. 
   The Colombian government has done everything we have asked of it, even renegotiating the already concluded agreement to add new provisions regarding labor and environmental issues. But to no avail. 
   As a result, our friends and enemies are in danger of concluding that the U.S. has turned its back on Colombia and that the assault on U.S. interests and allies is paying off. 
   Over the past decade, the once near-hopeless security situation in Colombia has been transformed, with crucial assistance and unwavering support provided by the United States. 
   But there is much left to be done. 
   Although the insurgency has been severely weakened, there are many thousands of guerrillas still operating. The cultivation and export to the U.S. of illegal drugs continues. And there are large areas of Colombia in which the central government has virtually no presence. 
   U.S. assistance and support for Colombia has been instrumental in its success, and will continue to be so in the future. 
   But that means more than simply security assistance and money. The easiest, most direct, and most effective means we have to bolster Colombia at this critical stage is passage of the free trade agreement. 
   Congress has a golden opportunity to support our embattled ally and further our own interests. If we falter, so may Colombia, and the achievements of a decade will be needlessly squandered. And then some may ask: ``Who lost Colombia?''

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, I rise in favor of the bill before us, H.R. 3887, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. This was introduced by the chairman of our committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lantos; and it remains one of the premier issues facing us today, Mr. Speaker. 
   Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It is a major source of revenue for international criminal syndicates, and it is a grave abuse against human dignity. Hundreds of thousands of people are trafficked across international borders every year. It is estimated that 80 percent of those are women, and half are children. Millions more are trafficked into sexual servitude and forced labor within their own countries. 
   In Iran, children are trafficked into sexual slavery and forced into involuntary servitude as beggars and day laborers. In Syria, women trafficked from South and Southeast Asia are forced to work as domestic servants, and women from Eastern Europe and Iraq are forced into prostitution. In China, up to 90 percent of North Korean refugee women fall prey to traffickers who sell them into sexual slavery. In our own hemisphere, Mr. Speaker, Cuba has been shamefully promoted as a destination for sex tourism that exploits large numbers of Cuban children. 
   The dehumanization and the brutality suffered by trafficking victims are nearly incomprehensible. I am proud that the Congress has helped turn this former non-issue into a priority for our United States Government and an issue, indeed, of international concern. 
   The enactment of the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act 7 years ago was a watershed event. I want to commend the author of that act and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. CHRIS SMITH, whose leadership on these issues has been central to the progress that we have made so far. 
   While there have been some signs of improvement, such as a larger number of countries that have enacted anti-trafficking legislation, other problems remain widespread. The number of countries, for example, listed in tier three, that is the most problematic category in the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, has actually increased from 12 countries to 16 since last year. Some of the governments with the worst records, such as Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Venezuela, continue to resist making even basic efforts to protect vulnerable children and women. 
   A number of problem countries like Russia and China sit on the tier two ``Watch List'' year after year after year without further consequences, even though that category was originally created as a warning that countries are about to slip into the tier three category. 
   The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, will not only reauthorize key aspects of prior trafficking legislation but it will also enhance our international anti-trafficking efforts, our domestic law enforcement and victim assistance activities, and efforts to fight the use of child soldiers worldwide. It will improve our Nation's victim-centered approach to fight human trafficking by strengthening each of the so-called ``Three P's,'' prevention, protection, prosecution. 
   I want to commend the author of this bill again, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Lantos, and my fellow cosponsors for the perseverance and the compromise that they have invested in ensuring that this bill receive wide bipartisan support throughout consideration by the three committees of jurisdiction: Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, and Energy and Commerce. The revised text before us today also has been endorsed by an impressively broad array of organizations and experts from across the political spectrum. 
   The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 is a vital weapon in our fight against the heartbreaking scourge of human trafficking, and it deserves our full support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to be on this floor following the words of our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Mr. Lantos, the loan survivor in Congress of the Holocaust, and I echo all of his sentiments. 
   I also wish to commend my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), for offering this resolution. 
   Although we come to the floor and pass resolutions, and sometimes we don't take the time to read them, I hope that all of my colleagues do read this inspirational story of the Sharp family and the way that they helped so many flee the Nazi atrocities, and I rise today in strong support of Mr. McGovern's resolution. 
   It recognizes Reverend Waitstill Sharp and his wife Martha Sharp as genuine American heroes. Further, it pays tribute to the Reverend Sharp and his wife Martha for having their names added to the Wall of Rescuers in the permanent exhibit of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on September 14 of this year. 
   It further commends the organization founded to support the Sharps' work, the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, for its role in rescuing Jews and opponents of the Nazi regime in Europe from the years 1939 to 1945, as well as carrying on to this day the legacy of the Sharps by working to save the lives of people in places like Darfur, Sudan, and to protect human rights worldwide. 
   Furthermore, it requests that a copy of this resolution be provided to the direct descendants of these courageous individuals in remembrance of their valiant efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Sharp family is an example for all to emulate. They demonstrated unparalleled courage in the face of Nazi aggression by providing relief and humanitarian assistance to Jewish refugees, particularly children, and to establish escape routes that were the difference between life and death for many Jews during the Holocaust. They deserve to be honored and they deserve to be remembered today and always. 
   Elie Wiesel has said that he decided to devote his life to telling the story of the Holocaust because, in his words, ``Having survived, I owe something to the dead, and anyone who does not remember betrays them again.'' 
   We would be betraying the victims as well as the survivors if we did not also remember and honor those who risked their own lives to save the lives of others. For this reason, I ask my colleagues to render their full support to the resolution before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   President Ronald Reagan said, ``We must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.'' 
   This courage and this commitment are most clearly evident with our men and women serving our Nation in Iraq. I see it in my stepson Doug and my daughter-in-law Lindsay, who were Marine officers flying missions in Iraq. Lindsay is now serving in Afghanistan. I see it in a valued member of my committee staff, Matt Zweig, who just returned from a 1-year tour of duty in Iraq. They believe in, and have fought for, our mission. And their courage is palpable. 
   And I think of the Parsons brothers in my congressional district. You have heard me speak about them before. All three of them were my West Point nominees. I have known them since they were just young boys. Bill Parsons is serving his second tour in Iraq. The youngest boy, Charlie, is on his first deployment in Iraq. Huber Parsons is on his third deployment to Iraq. 
   But today Huber, and his Stryker Brigade, was hit by a deeply buried IED. The Stryker caught on fire, and Huber thought that he was going to burn to death as the Stryker fully caught on fire. They were battling small arms fire as they pulled him away. Their driver was killed. Huber suffered a broken leg and a broken ankle, but his spirits are high. He will soon be in a military hospital in Germany. But his commitment to the mission, unwavering. 
   The father, in deep pain, wrote to me in an e-mail just a few hours ago, and he said, ``We are but man and only know in part. But we know that we have a great God, and we give Him praise in all things.'' He said, ``Yes, even in this.'' 
   He adds, ``Please pray for the families of those who have paid the greatest price, for Huber's complete and speedy recovery ..... and for the men whom they command and lead and for all the men and women who serve our Nation.'' And he says, ``And pray for the wisdom of our President, all policymakers, and all commanders.'' 
   Yet we stand here today, Mr. Speaker, faced with a supplemental that seeks to put these valiant efforts on an installment plan as they face a brutal, ruthless enemy that seeks to kill Americans wherever they are, as this supplemental ties the hands of our military commanders, as it doles out funds in pieces, and yet it provides millions to the United Nations and other international organizations through next September. This cannot, this must not, stand. 
   For the Parsons brothers and for all who serve our Nation and risk their lives every day, let's succeed and let's vote against this supplemental.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from California for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, whether or not some choose to acknowledge it, we are at war with militant Islamists who seek our destruction. Yet some on the other side of the aisle today announced that the war is lost in Iraq. This comment shows little understanding of the ability and the determination of our men and women in the Armed Forces. 
   Naysayers and those who doubt our Nation's ability to prevail over evil have existed throughout the centuries, and it appears that there are those who doubt the ability of this century's greatest generation to defeat these Islamist militant extremists operating in Iraq. 
   Our mission is just. The soldier cannot be separated from his mission. All I have to do is look to the inspiration of the Parsons brothers from my congressional district, who are serving in Iraq. They know that we must and indeed we can succeed. 
   Huber Parsons was with the 101st Airborne for two long Iraq deployments. He is currently on his third deployment with the Army Stryker Brigade. His twin brother, Bill, has served two tours in Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq. And their little brother, Charlie, is on his first deployment in Iraq. All three brothers are deployed in Iraq right now. 
   I ask for the Parsons brothers and for all of our brave men and women serving our Nation in Iraq that we not put them at increased risk with these arbitrary, artificial deadlines. 
   My stepson, Douglas, and my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, both served in Iraq as Marine fighter pilots, and tomorrow Lindsay will be deploying to Afghanistan to continue her military service. 
   Arbitrary deadlines and the consequences of retreating and failure are personal issues for me. Establishing arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal of our forces before Iraq is stable and secure gives the insurgents, as well as the Islamic extremist terrorists, a roadmap, a how-to guide, on how to defeat the United States, our Iraqi partners and other coalition forces in Iraq. Our troops understand this. Our enemies understand this. Our allies understand it; we must as well. 
   We met with Egyptian leader Mubarak just 2 weeks ago in a bipartisan congressional delegation, and this is what he told us: ``Withdrawing from Iraq without creating stability will mean that the U.S. will suffer and all of us in the region will suffer. I know how these terrorists think,'' Mubarak said to us, ``and they will come after you and then come after us.'' 
   He continued by saying, ``The way to control Iran is for the U.S. to succeed in stabilizing Iraq. Withdrawal of your forces in Iraq without making Iraq stable will strengthen Iran and will cause you harm and will cause all of us harm.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we either stand now against the Islamic militant jihadists operating in Iraq or have these militants continue to threaten our men and women fighting the forces that seek our destruction. We cannot leave our troops serving in Iraq or anywhere else vulnerable to the whims of armchair generals in Congress. 
   Support our troops. Reject this motion.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we gather in this hallowed place to honor the life and work of our beloved colleague, Tom Lantos, our sorrow at news of his death is tempered by our admiration for his extraordinary contributions to our great country. An unfailingly gracious and courageous man, Tom was recognized by colleagues as a leader who left an enviable legacy of service to our country. We were fortunate indeed to have known him. Annette and the entire Lantos family have our heartfelt condolences. 
   Tom and Annette's heroic journey to America through extraordinary adversity is well known to us all and is the topic perhaps for a future biographer who can adequately capture the tenor of life under the oppressive yolk of fascism during those terrible times more than half a century ago. 
   Tom's unsurpassed work as a champion of human rights and for human dignity cannot be separated from his fiery trials through which he passed as a young man. 
   His life bears witness to the endurance of the human spirit. As a colleague, Tom enjoyed the respect of his peers across the political spectrum, because all of us admired him as an ardent American patriot. 
   During our many meetings together, when we met with foreign leaders here and abroad, his love of country was always evident. He understood an old truth that all of us would do well to relearn: united we stand, and divided we fall. 
   To be sure, Tom could be a vehement critic of an administration policy during House debate. But he would not hesitate to remind a visiting group of European parliamentarians to temper their criticism of U.S. policy or risk being labeled as hypocrites for their feeble resistance to genocide at Auschwitz or at modern-day death camps in Sudan. 
   His defense of the national security policies would surprise and perhaps rankle some, but not those of us who knew Tom as an unbeatable foe of Communist tyranny. 
   All of us here tonight have so many stories to share about Tom, about his life with Annette, and his vital work; and we will surely honor him in the months ahead in other appropriate ways. It is fitting, though, that we honor the life of this great patriot, for it was his work and his life that enriched us. So tonight, rather than merely mourn his passing, let us thank God that Tom lived among us and left such a strong legacy for us to follow. 
   I often said to Tom before our committee hearings that it was a great testament to a wonderful Nation that two naturalized citizens, witnesses to the evils of communism and oppression, would serve as chairman and ranking member of the committee charged with developing and overseeing our foreign policy efforts. And I cannot fully explain to Tom and his family my deep gratitude to Tom for his service and for his dedication. 
   And, Annette, our prayers are with you and your family. And how odd to say, as Mr. Hoyer pointed out, how odd to say ``Annette'' without saying ``Tom and Annette,'' for they were a unit. Thank you, Tom. Godspeed, my friend. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of the House's consideration of the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   This is an important measure which will ensure that our efforts to save the lives of so many people afflicted with the scourge of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria continue in a rigorous, holistic way. 
   The continued success of the program that was brought to life 5 years ago by our late colleagues, Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, is a matter of vital importance to us here in the United States. 
   As President Bush said in his recent trip to Africa: ``I want the American people to understand that when it comes to saving lives, it is in our national interest. It is in our security interest to help alleviate areas of the world from hopelessness. It is in our moral interest to save the lives of others.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what the bill before us is about. The program that we are authorizing today, commonly known as PEPFAR, is now recognized as perhaps the most successful foreign assistance program of the United States of America since the Marshall Plan. 
   Just as the Marshall Plan protected American lives then by helping to stabilize a continent ravaged by war, PEPFAR is protecting Americans lives today by helping to stabilize a continent ravaged by disease. PEPFAR does more than just express American compassion, it supports American security. 
   As an illustration of this important point, I would like to quote from a letter that I received from our former House colleague from Wisconsin, the Honorable Mark Green, who is now serving as the United States ambassador to the United Republic of Tanzania. Ambassador Green said the following: ``We are approaching the 10th anniversary of the terrorist bombings of Embassy Dar es Salaam and Embassy Nairobi. And I can't help but note that General Wald, the former deputy commander of the U.S. European Command, has called HIV/AIDS the third greatest threat to U.S. national security.'' 
   Yes, this bill is less than perfect in some aspects. All compromises are, Mr. Speaker. But it is a good bill, one that will save millions of lives around the world and help to maintain stability in a key region. 
   As Chairman Hyde said during the markup of the original Leadership Act in 2003: ``Congress is so equally balanced that it is very difficult on controversial matters, on expensive matters, on matters that have different blocks who have different points of view to reach an agreement. In a situation like this, compromise is the heart and soul of the process.''  
   He added: ``We cannot please the left and the right and the center. We can't please the libertarians and the archconservatives and the Republicans and the Democrats with legislation that would have done all of these magic properties, but we can do our best and we have done our best.'' 
   In 2003, Mr. Speaker, we did do our best and created a program that demonstrated compassion to so many since its enactment. 
   Today, the House has an opportunity to do its best again. 
   Today, for the sake of the fathers, the mothers, and the children who are victims of HIV/AIDS, as well as tuberculosis and malaria, today we can follow in the steps of Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, demonstrating that American compassion that distinguishes our Nation and our people above all others. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a balanced bill. I believe that this is a bill that will save many lives and protect American security.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I thank my good friend, the new chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee, Howard Berman. He has got a tough act to follow, because we all loved Tom Lantos. The gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) had a hard act to follow, but, boy, did he fill those big shoes very well. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been your first trial by fire, and you came out looking so well because you accommodated the concerns and the anxieties and the worries that so many of our Members had. 
   I want to thank on a bipartisan level all of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, from the most conservative to the most liberal. We were able to forge a compromise that reached a broad consensus on this vital and complex legislation. We couldn't have done it without the leadership of Chairman Berman, but also without his very able staff and the staff on our Republican side of the aisle as well. 
   The foundation of this bill, as Chairman Berman has pointed out, is the 2003 Leadership Act, which was the first comprehensive U.S. emergency response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic and which stands as a noble legacy of our two former chairmen, Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos. They understood, as do all of us, that millions of lives around the world depend on our country's willingness to battle this pandemic together. It does honor to our country that 5 years ago we undertook this true mission of mercy. We are fortunate to have the opportunity to reaffirm that commitment by our vote here today. 
   Since the passage of the original Leadership Act of 2003, extensive emergency treatment and prevention programs have begun to slow the advance of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The success of these programs is well documented. I would like to cite some specifics. 
   According to the office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, more than 1.4 million people infected with the HIV virus are now being treated with the necessary drugs to fight this disease. PEPFAR has supported HIV testing and counseling for 30 million people, cared for million 6.7 million, and, as the chairman pointed out, including almost 3 million orphans and vulnerable children. We are on our way to achieving the 5-year goal of preventing the infection of 7 million people. PEPFAR has supplied medicines for approximately 800,000 expectant mothers, preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. What a successful program. 
   The legislation before us keeps faith with the core principles of the Hyde-Lantos Act. We have modified the original blueprint by adding or adjusting a number of provisions based on 5 years of real-world experience regarding what works and what doesn't. 
   In addition to medicines and sophisticated methods of treatment, the 2003 act mandated that a more comprehensive approach be used that took into account local values and indigenous cultures, and the act before us does that. 
   With respect to this balanced approach, the wife of the President of Zambia said it best recently when she said, ``There are several ways in which we can reach the young people. One of the effective ways is abstinence. It brings back dignity and self-responsibility to young people, because they know their bodies are not supposed to be abused and they learn to say no.'' 
   The compromise bill before us removes the specific directive in current law so that implementation, as the chairman has pointed out, can be better refined to reflect the varying circumstances in host countries. Nevertheless, the bill before us continues this comprehensive approach by requiring that the AIDS Coordinator provides a balanced approach for prevention activities for sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS and to ensure that abstinence and faithfulness programs are implemented and funded in a meaningful and equitable way. 
   The agreement that we have is carefully crafted and designed in the area of reproductive health and family planning to ensure that HIV funding for prevention is not misused to promote programs beyond the scope of this bill.  We can do that, if you wish, in other bills. But the bill ensures also that those working to fight these diseases are not required to choose between their conscience and receiving the assistance they need to carry out their work. 
   Also we worked a lot on the prostitution and the sex trafficking pledge. The bipartisan agreement maintains the existing certification requirement that any group or organization receiving PEPFAR funds explicitly oppose prostitution and sex trafficking. The U.S. Agency for International Development has implemented this prohibition by requiring that any group that receives funding sign a pledge affirming its opposition to these practices. 
   Let me be clear: Neither current law nor the pledge itself prevents organizations from working with prostitutes or other high risk groups, but it does mandate that that assistance to these individuals not be mistaken for approval or support of the activities that take their terrible toll on their bodies and that can only be described as destructive to human dignity. 
   We had issues with accountability and national security, and although this bill is absolutely motivated by the altruism of the American people, I believe that this legislation ensures that our interests are protected as well.     
   For example, U.S. contributions to the Global Fund will be subject to more stringent oversight than is currently provided by calling for the Fund to meet even higher benchmarks of transparency and accountability. 
   The legislation also includes a prohibition on taxation of our assistance by foreign governments to ensure that assistance intended to the afflicted not be siphoned off by unaccountable bureaucrats. 
   The bill also strengthens our national security. The HIV pandemic is first and foremost a health issue, but it also is one of the most significant global, economic, and security threats of our generation. General Charles Wald, the Former Deputy Commander of the US-European Command, has called HIV/AIDS the third greatest threat to our national security. 
   Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria kill millions of people during their most productive years, between the ages of 16 and 50. And in the hardest hit countries, the AIDS epidemic alone is killing a generation of parents, of teachers, of health care workers, bread winners, peacekeepers, shattering the economic and the social life of villages, communities, and, indeed, nations. 
   Losses on this scale have staggered the economies of the hardest hit countries. Without further prevention, without further treatment, without further care efforts, the AIDS pandemic will continue to spread its mix of death, poverty, and despondency that is further destabilizing governments and societies and undermining the security of entire regions. 
   Our former House colleague from Wisconsin, Mark Green, who now serves as the United States Ambassador to Tanzania, wrote to me following the committee's passage of this bill highlighting this security aspect. He said, ``In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could spread and create a long-term breeding ground of radicalism.'' 
   PEPFAR programs in turn help to counter these precursor conditions. As General Wald has said, ``In addition to the obvious humanitarian efforts of PEPFAR, the program is one of our Nation's development activities that can help strengthen the social structure that keep communities and nations secure.'' 
   The threat is not just in faraway lands, but in our own back yard. Many countries in the Caribbean have been particularly hard hit. This bill places a new emphasis on assistance to this region. It adds 14 Caribbean countries to the existing list of nations in which the Global AIDS Coordinator is given explicit statutory authority over HIV/AIDS programs. 
   Let me add that, although all of us share the goal of reducing the further spread of this pandemic, this is also a personal issue for me both professionally and morally. South Florida, which falls within my congressional district, ranks first in the State of Florida in the number of AIDS cases. Roughly 19 percent of the State total for those living with HIV reside in my district. So, I am all too familiar with the human cost of this disease, and hope for the day when its ravages are safely confined to the past. 
   Although not all Members will fully agree with every aspect of this complex compromise, it does contain the bipartisan approach that we have maintained throughout the years of work on HIV/AIDS in our committee. We have an opportunity, indeed, a responsibility, to continue the lifesaving work that began 5 years ago. This legislation is a means by which that can happen. 
   But the dry text of the legislation, nor the posters behind me, cannot adequately capture the human drama for which we are trying to write the exit strategy. 
   The poster behind me shows where PEPFAR has worldwide activities, the number of countries where it has positively had an impact. The second poster shows the number of adults and children estimated to be living with HIV just this last year. And, the third poster shows some of the faces of the children whom this legislation has saved. 
   Let me read, to conclude, from a Washington Post op ed authored by our chairman, Henry Hyde, 5 years ago. Mr. Hyde wrote, 
   ``Not since the bubonic plague swept across the world in the last millennium has our world confronted such a horrible curse as we are now witnessing with the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
   ``This pandemic is more than a humanitarian crisis. 
   ``To those who suggest that the United States has no stake in this pandemic, let me observe that the specter of failed states across the world is certainly our concern. 
   ``The AIDS virus is a mortal challenge to our civilization. 
   ``It is my hope that each of us will be animated by the compassion, and, yes, the vision, that has always defined what it means to be an American.'' 
   Madam Chairman, endless numbers of children have already been orphaned and deprived of the protection and the love of their parents. We cannot make their world whole again, but there is much that we can do to comfort and care for them and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. 
   I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill in a strong bipartisan manner, and thereby allow our country to continue our mission, our mission of mercy, for the waiting millions. 
   And with that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chairman, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, sometimes when we are negotiating legislative text or debating the merits of an important bill, such as the one before us today, we can lose sight of the extent of the impact that our decisions here can have on the lives of so many. 
   I would like to quote from some of the African leaders whose people and societies have been rescued from certain death by our PEPFAR programs. The President of Tanzania has said the following, ``There would have been so many orphans to date. Had it not been for PEPFAR, the care and treatment, so many parents now who would have been infected can now live. And some of them can live as many years as possible. So can you imagine if this program is discontinued or disrupted? There would be so many people who would lose hope, and certainly there would be death. You create more orphans. So my passionate appeal is for PEPFAR to continue.'' 
   Or listen to the words of the President of Botswana when he said, ``PEPFAR is now a critical partner in the historic and heroic battle to save lives. PEPFAR has turned despair into hope. PEPFAR has galvanized donor countries and agencies alike to act in concert in the interest of humanity. If the fund is not renewed and if it is not replenished, the momentum generated by PEPFAR thus far will no doubt be lost, and the hope rekindled by the generosity of the American people will be extinguished. I say this to you,'' said the President of Botswana, ``and that's what I said to the congressional committees recently.'' 
   So, Madam Chairman, these and so many other statements reflect the human contribution of this critical United States program. But they also demonstrate that PEPFAR programs are helping to win hearts and minds throughout the world. They are building and strengthening the bonds between the governments and the people of these countries and the United States of America. They are building good will toward our Nation and toward the American people. 
   Madam Chairman, after the deplorable attacks on our Nation on that fateful day almost 7 years ago, we in this Chamber committed ourselves to using the range of U.S. foreign policy tools, including soft power, to counter the conditions that breed hatred, intolerance and radicalism; radicalism that targets the United States, our interests and our allies, and seeks to undermine our freedom and democracy everywhere. The bill before us is a vital tool in that effort. 
   Again, as our former colleague, our Ambassador to Tanzania has said, ``I  want you to know that PEPFAR is crucial to my current mission as Ambassador to the United Republic of Tanzania. It is a tremendous public diplomacy tool that shows America at her best, a compassionate partner who is committed to helping Tanzania meet its enormous HIV/AIDS challenges.'' 
   ``I was asked to present remarks to the National Consultive Meeting of Islamic Leaders and Scholars here in Dar es Salaam,'' continues the Ambassador. ``This was a historic gathering, as it was the first time that the most esteemed Muslim leaders of Tanzania had gathered together to discuss their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS. They invited me to speak alongside the President because of their concern about HIV/AIDS and their awareness of America's historic contribution to HIV prevention, treatment and care programs.'' Why? Because of PEPFAR. ``So as we help to save lives and restore hope,'' the Ambassador ends, ``we are leaving a lasting impression on the people of this country.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I hope that our colleagues will see the great merit of this program and that we will continue to build upon it to save many more lives. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I support Mr. Blumenauer's amendment, which would add safe drinking water to nutrition and income security on the list of programs for which direct linkages are encouraged. For patients whose immune systems have been compromised by AIDS, the availability of safe, clean drinking water is vitally important. This is especially true for HIV positive women with young infants who use infant formula to avoid transmitting the virus to their babies during feeding. If the water used in the formula is not clean, their babies are at high risk for waterborne diseases. Therefore, this amendment would allow PEPFAR to link with existing safe drinking water programs in order to provide clean water to these treatment patients.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chairman, I actually support the McCollum-Jackson amendment, which would add Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho to the list of countries in which the Global AIDS Coordinator is given explicit statutory authority. 
   Malawi, Swaziland, and Lesotho all face major HIV/AIDS epidemics and have received significant resources through PEPFAR in the first 5 years of implementation. By giving the Global AIDS Coordinator explicit authority over the U.S. Government's HIV/AIDS programs in these countries, the Congress is signaling that it believes the U.S. Government should continue to come alongside these nations' governments and their citizens to support them in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and I commend Ms. McCollum and Mr. Jackson for offering it. 
   I would like to yield the remaining time, Madam Chairman, to our chairman, Chairman Berman of California, as well as Mr. Payne of New Jersey, with Mr. Payne of New Jersey first.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Chairman, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Carson for his well-reasoned and important amendment. We all had the honor of serving with his grandmother, Julia Carson, for many years in this body, and I know that Congresswoman Carson is looking down at her grandson and saying she is mighty proud. So thank you so much for your amendment, and thank you for carrying on in her great legacy by presenting wonderful topics and themes for us to discuss on the floor. 
   I fully support the Carson amendment because it focuses on building human and institutional capacity in PEPFAR host countries. It directs the global AIDS coordinator and the USAID administrator to expand their plan by strengthening health systems of host countries by encouraging post secondary educational institutions, particularly those in the African continent, to collaborate with the post secondary educational institutions here in the United States, including historically black colleges and universities in training health care workers. 
   As other provisions of this bill made clear, an important component of the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, is the strengthening of the educational capacity in host countries to train health care workers. The Carson amendment does exactly that. I congratulate him for it. He is a welcome addition to our Chamber. 
   I would like to yield to Ms. Lee of California who has been working on this issue for a long time, Madam Chairman.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (CALLING ON UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO CHARGE IRANIAN PRESIDENT WITH CERTAIN VIOLATIONS BECAUSE OF HIS CALLS FOR DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 21, which denounces the Iranian regime, its belligerent rhetoric and behavior, and urges the international community to hold it accountable and prevent it from achieving its horrific goals. 
   As the U.S. and our allies attempt to prevent the radical Islamic regime in Iran from developing nuclear capabilities, we should reflect on that regime's vision of the future. While most people desire to live in a world of freedom, of liberty, of prosperity and of peace, Iran's rulers actively seek a world of oppression, of destruction, of war, a world without Israel and without a United States of America. 
   The Iranian leader Ahmadinejad frequently pushes for Israel's destruction, saying that this sovereign state should be wiped off the map, calling it a disgraceful blot on the face of the Islamic world, as Ambassador Watson pointed out, and proclaiming that anybody who recognized Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic Nation's fury. 
   On June 3, Ahmadinejad stated, ``With God's help, the countdown button for the destruction of [Israel] has been pushed.'' When Ahmadinejad calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, let us be clear, he is calling for the genocide of Jews. That is why he has continued to cast doubt on the veracity of the Holocaust, calling it a ``myth.'' 
   His despicable comments cheapen the suffering of millions of Jews, desecrate their memory and pave the way for another Holocaust to occur at the hands of Tehran. The Iranian leader does not threaten Jews and Israel, he explicitly threatens our very own existence. 
   In October of 2005, he asked, ``Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism. ..... You had best know that this slogan and this goal are attainable, and, surely, can be achieved.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, his words and actions do not merely reflect his own views or those of a few powerless extremists. Iran's Supreme Leader, for example, said, ``This cancerous tumor of a state should be removed from the region.'' 
   Rafsanjani, the former Iranian leader who continues to hold significant influence, and who some mistakenly call a moderate, has threatened Israel with destruction by nuclear weapons, saying that the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything, while it will merely harm the Islamic world. 
   These are no idle threats, those are not just mere words and rhetoric. Iran continues to sponsor terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah who have murdered scores of Israelis, they have murdered Americans as well, as well as Jews who live outside of Israel, and they have violated Israel's territory, and they continue to hold Israeli soldiers hostage. 
   The existence of our Nation and Israel are not subject to compromise and the lives of Americans and Israelis are not negotiable. 
   Indeed, in the wake of the Holocaust, the United Nations was founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to protect the dignity and the worth of every person. The words and deeds of Ahmadinejad and his cohorts violate Article 2, section 4 of the U.N. Charter, which require all U.N. member states to ``refrain ..... from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.'' 
   Their implicit demands for the death of Jews violates the Genocide Convention, which states that those who commit or incite genocide shall be punished, whether they are rulers, government officials or private citizens. 
   This resolution, offered by my friend and distinguished colleague, Mr. Rothman of New Jersey, and Mr. Kirk of Illinois, calls for the U.N. Security Council to charge Ahmadinejad with violating those binding documents and for the Council to consider stronger measures to prevent Iran from obtaining the nuclear weapons that it could use to threaten and to attack Israel and the world. 
   Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this very serious resolution and reaffirm our resolve to end the Iranian threat. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for asking for this time. 
   I want to be clear about my objection of putting Ahmadinejad's statements in the Record. Mr. Kucinich has an opportunity, as a Member of this House, to clear up the record, as he has pointed out in his statements, and put in those remarks on his own. I would hate to have Ahmadinejad's statements be included as a part of the record in this part of the debate where we are saying that he is a despot. He is a person who denies the Holocaust existence, who has called for Israel's destruction, and to be mincing about with words and translations, I know the gentleman from Ohio's motives are clear. He is not saying that he is calling for Israel's destruction, but I think that any interpretation of Ahmadinejad's words and deeds would clearly say that that is Ahmadinejad's motives.     
   So I would not like his statements to be made a part of the record in this part of the discussion, but he, as a Member of Congress, is free to clear the record, as he points out, and put Ahmadinejad's words on his own time in the Congressional Record. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to yield my remaining time to Mr. Rothman.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 151, introduced by my distinguished colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). 
   As the gentlewoman from California has pointed out, Mr. Speaker, this important resolution deals with a strange and quite troubling pattern of the killing of independent journalists in Russia over the past decade. We have different estimates, but one places the number of murdered reporters at 21 over the past 7 years, that estimate coming from the esteemed organization, Reporters Without Borders. Another estimate from the International News Safety Institute puts the number at close to 90 reporters killed in Russia over the past 11 years. 
   Now what is truly strange is that most of these murders remain unsolved. Many of the murdered journalists have made it their personal cause to investigate corruption and the abuse of power at all levels of the Russian government. 
   Perhaps many of our colleagues will recall how just a few weeks ago a brave Russian reporter was shot in the head on a street in Moscow. She had written articles criticizing the Russian government for its human rights abuses. Her murder remains unsolved. 
   Perhaps our colleagues will recall the more recent death of a reporter who died in March of this year, as the gentlewoman pointed out, falling five stories from a window in the stairway of his apartment building. He was a military affairs reporter who had criticized the Russian Government in his articles, and he had been planning to publish a report on the arms sales of Russia to the state sponsors of terror, Iran and Syria. 
   All of these seekers of truth did not deserve to die for their journalistic efforts. Bringing to justice the murderers of these reporters does deserve the strongest possible support of their government, their police, their prosecutors, and yet it appears to be strangely absent. 
   Mr. Speaker, a free and democratic society requires freedom of the press, freedom of the media and respect for the safety of those who at times risk their lives to uncover the truth. Russia will not be a free and democratic society until that is the case in their country. 
   We can and we should ask the Russian government to stand up in defense of its independent media and the safety of its reporters, but the unwillingness of the Russian government to solve so many of these murders and the successful efforts of the Kremlin to use state-owned or influenced companies to buy up and sensor the Russian media shows that our voices may be falling on willingly deaf ears. 
   Nevertheless, that is what we should do. We should call on the Russian government to respect human rights and the rule of law by investigating these crimes with vigor and with sincerity. And that is the message, Mr. Speaker, of the resolution before us. 
   This resolution also calls on our President to specifically offer our assistance to help the Russian government investigate those crimes. 
   We should also ask the Russian president to seek out and accept competent outside law enforcement assistance to investigate these crimes, and this resolution calls for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we recognize the tremendous contributions made by independent journalists in Russia, most especially those who suffer a bitter death as an unjust reward for their efforts. It is critical that we condemn in the strongest possible form the brutal murders of those who died trying to bring accurate and honest information to the Russian people about what is happening in their country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Smith's resolution to honor these intrepid reporters whose murders cry out for justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA AND LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY TO RECOMMIT TO POLITICAL SOLUTION IN NORTHERN UGANDA -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 80, which calls on the government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army, the LRA, to recommit to a political solution to the conflict in northern Uganda by engaging in good faith negotiations, and it urges support for the ongoing peace process from the United States and the international community. 
   As my good friend from California, Ambassador Watson, has pointed out, since 1986, northern Uganda has been embroiled in a vicious conflict which pits the forces of Uganda President Museveni against the rebel Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, of Joseph Kony. Kony claims to hold mystical powers and asserts that he has been guided by God to protect the Acholi people of northern Uganda who have been marginalized by Museveni's government. However, it is the Acholi themselves who have suffered disproportionately at the hands of the LRA. 
   The LRA, which has been designated as a terrorist group subject to the State Department Terrorist Exclusion List, moves in small, well-coordinated groups from bases in southern Sudan and more recently in eastern Congo. They hold no clear political agenda and make no attempt to hold territory, but they mutilate, torture, murder, rape and loot with impunity. 
   The LRA has abducted more than 20,000 people, mostly children, Mr. Speaker, to work as laborers, soldiers and sex slaves. Children are forced to the front lines, and those who do manage to escape from the LRA find it difficult, if not impossible, to return to their villages after having been forced to commit atrocities in front of their families. 
   One of the most visible signs of the collective trauma suffered by the people of northern Uganda was pointed out by Ambassador Watson, and this is the ``night commuter'' phenomenon. At the peak of the conflict, over 20,000 children would walk up to 15 kilometers from their village to the relative safety of the towns each and every night. They would spend the night under grossly overcrowded tents, sleeping on concrete floors, before getting up at dawn to make the return journey to  their villages. It was not for food, nor for the promise of social services that drew these children to these towns, but it was fear of abduction by the LRA. 
   While security conditions in northern Uganda have improved and the number of ``night commuters'' has decreased over the past years, roughly 90 percent, 90 percent, Mr. Speaker, of the local population remains homeless.     
   These 1.4 million people have been forced from their homes and herded by the Government of Uganda into camps for internally displaced persons. Despite attempts to ``decongest,'' the conditions in these camps are abysmal. 
   A health survey conducted by the Ugandan Ministry of Health in 2005 asserts that up to 1,000 people have died in the camps each week due to treatable illnesses such as diarrhea and malaria. The HIV/AIDS rate in the camps is more than double the national average. Sexual violence and domestic violence against women has increased dramatically, and the IDPs complain that camp life has all but destroyed the social fabric of the region. 
   For its own part, the Ugandan Government has failed in its efforts to defeat the LRA militarily, and to provide adequate protection for the citizens of northern Uganda. Instead, the government has embraced a highly questionable three-pronged approach towards resolving the conflict, and this includes: number one, pursuing a military campaign against the LRA; two, supporting indictments by the International Criminal Court, the ICC, against the LRA's top leaders; while, three, participating in peace talks while offering amnesty to LRA rebels. 
   It should come as no surprise that these mutually incompatible efforts have complicated matters and have failed to yield lasting results. Ill-timed military campaigns have undermined numerous mediation efforts, and the ICC indictments have led the LRA to question the sincerity of the amnesty deal offered by the government leaders. 
   Further, both the Government of Sudan and the LRA have routinely violated the agreement that is called the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement which has now expired without ever having been fully implemented. These actions have prompted skeptics to warn that both sides may be using the pretext of talks to rearm and replenish their forces. 
   If this is in fact the case, both the LRA and the Ugandan Government should be reminded of the fact that a military solution has alluded them for over 20 years. It is unlikely that a military solution will be any more viable now. 
   Thankfully, peace talks between the Government of Uganda and the LRA have resumed in Juba, Southern Sudan, and appear to be gaining momentum. Despite numerous challenges, not the least of which is the fact that delegations allegedly representing the two parties have questionable credibility, the Juba process is being hailed as the best chance yet to ending the conflict by political means. 
   H. Con. Res. 80 serves as an expression of support for this political dialogue. It expresses disapproval of the LRA leadership and its inconsistent commitment to resolving the conflict and it urges both the LRA and the Government of Uganda to engage in good-faith negotiations. It encourages all parties to immediately stop human rights violations and address the issues of accountability, and it calls on both the LRA and the Government of Uganda to renounce any intentions and halt any preparations to resume this violence. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the resolution calls on the State Department, on the United States Agency for International Development, and other similar government and nongovernment organizations within the international community to continue and to augment efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and to support a peaceful resolution to this humanitarian crisis. 
   According to the U.N. Office of Humanitarian Affairs, the conflict of northern Uganda is characterized by a level of cruelty seldom seen, and few conflicts rival it for its sheer brutality. 
   Despite all of this, Mr. Speaker, it remains one of the most overlooked humanitarian and human rights crises in the world today. H. Con. Res. 80 seeks to shed some well-deserved attention on the crisis in northern Uganda. It affirms the resolve of this Congress that the victims of this atrocious conflict shall not be forgotten. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for bringing this important resolution to the floor. I urge support by all of our Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take this opportunity to rise in support of House Resolution 233 authored by my good friend from Florida (Mr. Stearns) that recognizes the more than 200 years of sovereignty of Liechtenstein. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire 200 years ago, Liechtenstein became an independent state. 
   Since then, it has evolved as both a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. With a population of only about 34,000 people, we cannot expect Liechtenstein to take a leading role in international affairs, but it is an important ally in the cause of supporting and promoting democracy and, despite its small size, it has an importance for the United States that exceeds its geographical reach. 
   Exports are a major factor in the success of Liechtenstein's economy, and that outward-looking approach to commerce with the rest of the world has made it an important economic partner for the United States, creating almost 5,000 jobs here in the United States and achieving over half a billion dollars in exports to the American market in the year 2005 alone. 
   At home, in Europe, while it is not a member of the European Union, Liechtenstein is very closely aligned with the economic policies of that important organization and works to harmonize its economic policy very closely with it. 
   In the international arena, this small nation participates as a full partner in the United Nations, as well as in various critical international forums such as the World Trade Organization and the International Court of Justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this resolution by Mr. Stearns of Florida, which expresses our support for a continued strengthening of our relationships with Liechtenstein. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL FOR PEACE AND NONPROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, it's a joy to bring another truly bipartisan bill to the floor, thanks to the very able and skilled leadership of Chairman Lantos of our Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   This bill, as amended, Mr. Speaker, is a version of the original introduced by our esteemed Chairman Lantos and contains several new and important provisions that I would like to explain today. 
   The first of these addresses the supposed right of all countries to manufacture their own nuclear fuel through enrichment or repossessing. 
   The central problem of this assertion, Mr. Speaker, is that there's very little difference, as we know, in the technology that is used for civilian or for military purposes. So countries such as Iran, which are undoubtedly trying to acquire nuclear weapons, can innocently claim to be establishing a legitimate civilian nuclear program, a claim which can be virtually impossible for the outside world to disprove. For this reason, the acquisition of a similar capability by more and more countries, for whatever reason, means that the technology and the infrastructure needed to manufacture nuclear weapons will expand as well. 
   The continued spread of this deadly capacity poses an existential threat to the United States and, indeed, the entire world. We cannot allow this to continue. Unfortunately, efforts to stop this growing danger are undermined by a common but erroneous interpretation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, specifically article IV, which some assert gives every signatory country an absolute right to enrich and to reprocess. 
   It is both surprising and disappointing that many of the most ardent opponents of continued proliferation throughout the globe are also strong advocates of this supposed unrestricted right. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the treaty clearly states that the right to nuclear technology is conditioned by articles I and II, which are aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, including the capacity to manufacture them. 
   As such, it is the responsibility of countries seeking this capability to go beyond mere assertion and adopt measures that will conclusively demonstrate that it can be used only for peaceful purposes. It should not be the responsibility of the rest of the world to prove that the opposite is true. Iran has taught us the deadly foolishness of that approach. 
   I believe that it is profoundly wrong to hold the security of American people hostage to this flawed interpretation. Therefore, we have a responsibility to the people whom we represent to openly state the truth, that the NPT does not grant to all signatories an absolute right to enrich and reprocess. And the U.S. must work with our allies and others, as Mr. Lantos has pointed out, to ensure that this position becomes an integral element in the global non-proliferation effort. 
   A second set of changes to the original legislation places conditions on any country seeking to host a nuclear fuel bank, as well as on states that wish to receive fuel from the bank. The most important of these conditions, Mr. Speaker, is that state sponsors of terrorism would be prohibited from hosting a nuclear fuel bank and also from receiving fuel from it. This provision is essential to ensure that terrorist states, such as Iran, especially in their nuclear programs, do not benefit from the establishment of such a bank. 
   A further provision mandates that both host and recipient states have an effective and enforceable export control program regarding nuclear and dual-use technology comparable to that of the United States. 
   In addition, there is a stipulation that countries seeking assistance from a fuel bank cannot possess enrichment and reprocessing facilities. 
   A final set of changes, Mr. Speaker, would ensure that any fuel made available by the bank would be at the current market price, thereby sparing U.S. taxpayers from the open-ended burden of subsidizing the nuclear programs of other countries. 
   With the inclusion of these measures, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor Mr. Lantos' legislation, and I believe that it will prove to be a significant addition to the global non-proliferation effort. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Mr. Nadler's resolution, House Resolution 137, honoring the life and public service of Jacob Birnbaum and especially his commitment to freeing Soviet Jews from religious, cultural and communal extinction. 
   For decades, Mr. Birnbaum has been at the forefront of the nonviolent struggle for Soviet Jewry, establishing the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, and organizing marches, rallies and publication of educational materials aimed at freeing Jews trapped in the Soviet Union. 
   Mr. Birnbaum worked closely with Members of the United States Congress, testified at congressional hearings and consistently pushed for the United States to use our economic leverage against the Soviet Union to pressure that country so they could allow Soviet Jews and other East European Jews to escape the oppression of a religious and cultural nature in the Soviet Union. Throughout the decades, Mr. Birnbaum's persistence and commitment to human rights and religious freedom have been invaluable in freeing Soviet Jews and preserving their religious and cultural heritage. 
   Mr. Birnbaum's commitment to this cause has not diminished to this day. He continues to help Jewish educational institutions and former Soviet Jews even today. And Mr. Nadler's resolution before us honors Mr. Birnbaum and his years of public service. I urge Members to support this important resolution. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which seeks to impose a strategy of defeat on our Armed Forces and our country. By binding our military and our foreign policy in a straitjacket, this legislation would accomplish what thousands of our enemies have sought: to force the United States to retreat from Iraq without a plan for victory. 
   Proponents of rapid withdrawal would like us to ignore the reality that Iraq is but one of the critical battlefields in an ongoing war against Islamic jihadists, against global terrorism, a war declared by the jihadists and which saw its beginnings in November 1979, when Iranian radicals stormed our embassy, took Americans hostages, and held them captive for 444 days. 
   From there Americans, Westerners, innocent human beings were targeted. Where and when were they targeted? In the bombings of the Marine barracks in the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1983, in the bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993, in the bombings of the Khobar Towers in 1996, in the attacks of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and in the attacks on the USS Cole in the year 2000. 
   Proponents of rapid withdrawal want us to look at the bombings in Iraq in a vacuum, disregarding the similarities to the suicide bombers that have killed scores of innocent Israelis, those who planned and carried out the bombings in London, in Madrid, in Bali that claimed so many innocent lives.     
   These may not be the exact individuals, nor the same groups, but they are part of a global terrorist network working toward the same end, to destroy and to attack us and our allies. 
   The Islamic jihadists will not stop their agenda of destruction simply because we quickly withdraw from Iraq. They will, perhaps, stop when they see our nations, our cities, our communities burning, just as the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon burned on that terrible day of September 11, 2001. 
   They have clearly articulated their goals, listen to their words; al Qaeda's second in command, Al Zawahiri, made it clear in May of this year, and I quote him: ``The empire of evil, the United States, is about to end and a new dawn is about to break over mankind, which will be liberated from the caesars of the White House and Europe and from the Zionists.'' 
   Those seeking to impose an immediate withdrawal deadline are so intent on rushing through this legislation that they appear to have failed to consider the consequences of a U.S. national security interest of what euphemistically is being called a ``phased redeployment.'' 
   How is the strategy of quick withdrawal different from the strategy outlined by Al Zawahiri in a letter that he sent to al Qaeda operatives about driving the U.S. out of Iraq? How would we prevent the development of Iraq into a full base of operations for al Qaeda and other terrorist networks? We pretend to be armchair generals, seeking to undermine the strategies called for by our commanders on the field. But we should not. 
   Some label the current strategy of failure long before this full complement of units had been, in fact, deployed. But those doing the fighting in Iraq know that we have not failed, patriots such as the Parsons brothers from my congressional district. 
   Huber Parsons was serving his third deployment in Iraq, this time with the Army Stryker Brigade, when his vehicle was struck by a deep buried IED just a few months ago. His driver was killed, and Huber had to undergo a number of surgeries. I had the honor of visiting him often at Walter Reed. He is pictured here saluting his fallen brothers-in-arms at a memorial service in Fort Lewis, Washington. His twin, Bill, and his younger brother, Charlie, are both currently serving in Iraq, also with the Army Stryker Brigade. They, like my stepson, Doug, and my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, and so many others who are currently deployed in Iraq, are disheartened when they hear the references to failure and consider that the talks of this rapid withdrawal shows a lack of confidence in their ability to defeat the enemy. 
   Many patriots ask me why the Congress would endanger them and their fellow service men and women by having them engage the enemy with an immediately reduced force. Where, in a region of jihadists, are troops to be deployed to? What Middle Eastern government would want to host a retreating and defeated American Army? How does withdrawal to Kuwait or Qatar, as some have proposed, help us fight al Qaeda in Iraq? If al Qaeda strategies worked in Iraq and forced an American retreat, how can we not conclude that they will also pursue them in Kuwait and Qatar and beyond? 
   Mr. Speaker, George Orwell said that the quickest way of ending a war is to lose it. We should be discussing strategies for victory, not how to ensure our own defeat. 
   And let me close, Mr. Speaker, by reading the words of General Petraeus in an interview just a few days ago word for word. He said, ``I can think of few commanders in history who wouldn't have wanted more troops, more time or more unity among their partners. However, if I could only have one at this point in Iraq, it would be more time. This is an exceedingly tough endeavor that faces countless challenges.'' General Petraeus continues, None of us, Iraqi or American, are anything but impatient and frustrated at where we are. But there are no shortcuts. Success in an endeavor like this is the result of steady, unremittent pressure over the long haul. It is a test of wills, demanding patience, determination and stamina from all involved.  
   General Petraeus, as we know, was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate to be our commander in Iraq, yet somehow we have become better war commanders than General Petraeus. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) who has traveled to Iraq several times, I yield myself a minute to answer some questions posed on the other side of the aisle. 
   What we have here is a nonspecific, nondetailed, nothing planned for victory. The bill on page 3, since the gentleman refers to the bill, let's look at it. It talks about a reduction, a transition, a limited presence, a limited presence, again, with maximum attention paid to the protection of our Armed Forces. What does that mean? So you want our troops to face the terrorists with even less protection? 
   It shall be further implemented as part of a comprehensive strategy. What do these phrases mean? What would General Petraeus do if this legislation were to become law, which it will not? This is not a plan. It says nothing. It is making a political statement.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume because I'd like to comment on a point that was raised by my good friend from Indiana (Mr. Burton) regarding the intentions of Iran. 
   The deputy interior minister for security affairs and the former deputy head of the Revolutionary Guards in Iran said on April 26 of this year, ``Iran has long-range missiles that can make nowhere safe for America.'' 
   He also said, ``Iran is able to fire tens of thousands of missiles per day at American targets on a daily basis and, with its long-range missiles, can threaten Israel which is acting as America's'' proxy. 
   So it is clear to us, Mr. Speaker, that Iran seeks not just to wipe Israel off the map, as Ahmadinejad has said time and again, but to destroy the United States. So is the plan to immediately leave Iraq so that Iran can begin its takeover of the region? Is this in the national security interests of the United States? Is that going to make us safer? 
   I think that we should carefully consider what will happen were we to withdraw immediately as, it has been called for.

   Generals on the ground were consulted on this bill? Seventy percent of Americans support this bill, support immediate withdrawal of our troops? 
   This bill before us is nothing more than political hyperbole, partisan politics using our troops as cover, because the American people don't have this bill in front of them. We didn't have this bill before us until just a few hours ago. 
   Let me show you exactly what the Democratic leadership has scheduled for us to debate, and I use the term lightly. For an entire day, rather than do the hard work of our Congress that we need to do to have more serious discussions on Iraq, on this bill, on appropriations, it's six pages long, six pages long. 
   It was introduced yesterday, so I don't know what commanders on the field we consulted with. I would be interested in doing that, in finding that out. The first page is the title. The second page, it's a ``sense of Congress,'' language, nonbinding. The third page says ``reduce forces to limited presence.'' Who understands what that is? Certainly not the drafters of this bill. The fourth and the fifth page calls for a strategy. 
   Yet this Congress already has demanded a strategy from the President, and it is due in September, a report. That's what the Democrats say they have asked for. But yet they are not willing to wait for that report. 
   The last page is definitions. This is what we are debating today, Democratic politics using our troops as pawns. Commanders on the field who were consulted? Give me a break.

   And then there is the troubling provision to expedite visas for so-called Cuban agricultural inspectors. This would give free rein to any intelligence agent that the Cuban Government designates as an agricultural investigator to come to the United States. We should not open our borders to any Cuban agent to roam freely throughout the United States under the guise of being agricultural inspectors.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 573, which commends the efforts of the American people and advocacy groups to confront genocide in Darfur, Sudan. As the resolution notes, there has been no other grassroots advocacy effort in the United States aimed at addressing mass atrocities and human rights abuses in Africa that has been conducted with as much vigor since the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s and 1990s. 
   Mass demonstrations and protest marches have been organized. Days of prayer have been observed by churches, synagogues and mosques across the country. Countless fund-raisers for humanitarian relief have been conducted. 
   In my own district, school children as young as the first grade joined in an effort to collect hundreds of toys for the children of Darfur, which I had the opportunity to deliver while I visited that war-torn region. I am extremely proud of the contributions that these children made and all the people in my community, for it helped bring some joy to the youngest victims of a modern-day genocide. 
   Advocacy efforts on the Hill have also been extremely effective. Congressional offices have been inundated by phone calls, letters and visits by individuals committed to making a difference. It is due in no small part to the efforts of these groups that this body has considered 10 separate bills and resolutions which seek to address conditions in Darfur this year, including three that will be considered today alone. 
   I commend the efforts of those who have dedicated so much of their time and energy to raising awareness about the carnage that continues to unfold in Darfur, and I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

Resolution 726, which calls on the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and to halt acts of rape and sexual violence, all of which are occurring in Darfur, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic. 
   I would like to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos; and, of course, the lead sponsor, my friend Ms. DeLauro for their flexibility in accommodating concerns raised prior to the introduction and then during the committee consideration with regard to nonessential health issues and the International Criminal Court. 
   With those issues addressed in the amendment before us, we now have a strong resolution that effectively focuses much-needed attention on the  horrific reality that has befallen women and young girls in Darfur without contradicting our U.S. policy. 
   Since the beginning of this conflict, Mr. Speaker, Sudanese Armed Forces, janjaweed militias, and other rebel factions have used rape as a weapon of war. Despite the conclusions of the Darfur Peace Agreement and the deployment of peacekeepers, these attacks have continued unabated. 
   The pattern of rape and sexual violence is widespread and systematic, and it seems that no one is spared. Elderly women, pregnant mothers, even girls as young as 10 years of age have fallen victim to the rapist thugs who attack with immunity. This is a horrific practice that must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. 
   I fully support efforts to provide essential health and psychosocial services to these women and girls as well as efforts to hold those responsible for such attacks accountable for their actions. I strongly support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of House Resolution 740, which condemns the horrible and cowardly attacks that occurred last month in Haskanita. According to reports, as we've heard, up to 1,000 heavily armed rebels believed to be associated with the Sudan Liberation Army ambushed the small base that had been occupied  by the African Union peacekeeping mission on September 29 of this year. Ten AU peacekeepers were killed, including seven Nigerian soldiers and three unarmed military observers and civilian police officers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. Seven others were wounded, and 50 peacekeepers went missing. This was the worst attack against the AU, African Union, mission since it first deployed in July of 2004. 
   Khartoum deployed its forces to secure the area on October 6. Three days later, the entire village was found burned to the ground. Though Khartoum has not publicly claimed responsibility, there is little doubt about who burned the village. The initial attack against the African Union peacekeepers and the subsequent burning of the small base must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. 
   It is outrageous that rebels would attack those who had been sent to secure the peace in Darfur, particularly as the international community prepares to deploy a much larger hybrid United Nations/African Union peacekeeping mission to the region. It is equally outrageous, Mr. Speaker, that the Sudanese armed forces would seek retribution for the initial attack by burning the village to the ground and leaving an estimated 150,000 people homeless as a result. 
   It must be made clear to all parties to the conflict, the regime in Khartoum, its armed proxies, and the various rebel forces alike, that the ongoing attacks against peacekeeping forces, humanitarian operations, and civilian populations in Darfur are completely unacceptable. 
   Those who are truly interested in peace in Darfur must stop these senseless attacks, fully commit themselves to a binding cease-fire agreement, and rigorously pursue a political settlement. Failure to do so will send a clear signal to the international community about who is and who is not interested in peace. 
   And let there be no doubt that the United States has done much to alleviate the suffering in this war-torn region. The United States has provided more than $2 billion in humanitarian assistance and assistance to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur. The U.S. has also led the debate at the U.N. Security Council to get a larger, more capable United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping mission approved and deployed. 
   We have built and maintained the camps for the African Union forces, and we will continue to expand those camps until the U.N. takes over. We have also provided air lift for troops, and will fund 25 percent of all peacekeeping costs. 
   We have a dedicated special envoy who has led international efforts to bring peace to Darfur. We have funded and supported critical peace talks. We have imposed comprehensive sanctions against Khartoum. Meanwhile, China and Russia continue to allow their business interests in Sudan to override their concern for human rights. Both have failed to take meaningful action at the United Nations and have blocked consideration of sanctions against Khartoum. 
   So all obstructionists to peace in Darfur, regardless of their association, must ultimately be held to account. It is particularly appropriate that we are considering this resolution as Darfur peace talks are getting under way in Tripoli, Libya because, despite the best of intentions, the international community cannot impose peace on Darfur. The burden is on the Sudanese themselves to find a lasting political settlement. The time for Khartoum and the rebel factions to roll up their sleeves and get to work toward that end is long overdue. And, frankly, the people of Darfur deserve better. 
   I thank the sponsor, Ms. Jackson-Lee, for introducing this important and timely measure. I urge the support of all of my colleagues. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   I would like to commend my Florida colleagues for working together in a bipartisan manner to bring this bill to the floor today. I also want to thank our Florida Senators, Bill Nelson and Mel Martinez, for taking the lead and introducing this bill in the Senate. 
   As the author of this legislation, I am pleased that this bill would take the next step toward ensuring that we can properly pay tribute to one of Florida's great jurists by naming the courthouse in Miami in honor of the stellar career of Judge Atkins. 
   After receiving his law degree from the University of Florida in 1936, C. Clyde Atkins worked as a distinguished attorney and held prestigious posts such as the president of the Miami-Dade County Bar Association, as well as president of the Florida Bar. In 1966, Atkins was nominated to the bench by President Lyndon Johnson. The late Judge Atkins brought tremendous honor to the legal profession through his dedicated service as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida from 1966 until his death in 1999 at the age of 84.     
   Judge Atkins was committed to the administration of the rule of law without consideration of race, creed, or national origin. 
   He was recognized for his devotion to equality by the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Anti-Defamation League, to name just a few, Madam Speaker. 
   Judge Atkins was the first Catholic to be appointed to the bench in the Southern District of Florida. 
   His faith to his church was recognized by Pope Paul VI through his selection of Judge Atkins as a Knight of St. Gregory. 
   Judge Atkins was a fair and capable judge and rendered important decisions in the area of civil liberties and civil rights.  
   Judge Atkins declared that segregation in Miami-Dade County public schools was intolerable. He ruled that homelessness was not a crime and affirmed that freedom of expression was a constitutional right. 
   Judge Atkins was a man of principles who had the utmost respect for the rule of law. 
   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

   I want to extend my appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for his leadership on this issue and so many issues that are affecting U.S. relations with India and Indian Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know because of our previous speaker, Diwali is a major, multi-cultural festival celebrated in India and everywhere around the world. Although often referred to as a Hindu festival, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists also observe it. 
   Known as the Festival of Lights, it symbolizes the victory of good over evil, and lamps are lit as a sign of celebration and hope for mankind. 
   Diwali is celebrated for 5 consecutive days in October or November, and it is one of the most popular and eagerly awaited festivals in India. This celebration presents all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the many ways in which people, history and traditions of India, and elsewhere in South Asia, have contributed to the rich cultural mosaic that is the United States of America. It also reminds us again that America's extraordinary diversity is one of our Nation's most enduring strengths. 
   I was proud to sponsor a similar resolution in the 109th Congress, House Resolution 584, which also recognizes the significance of this important festival of Diwali.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony that was held for His Holiness the Dalai Lama earlier this month served to remind us all once again that the Chinese leadership has a long way to go before it becomes a responsible stakeholder in the international community. 
   Nowhere is this more apparent than in the callous disregard of Beijing of its international treaty obligations with regard to refugees, both North Korean and Tibetan. 
   The international press has reported incidents of Chinese border guards shooting and killing both North Korean and Tibetan refugees as they sought to flee China. These reprehensible acts must stop at once. 
   Earlier this month, Beijing demonstrated once again its continued contempt for the international refugee conventions. Chinese police entered the South Korean international school in Beijing to drag North Korean refugees from their hiding places. North Korean refugees had sought sanctuary there. 
   In the process, the Chinese police roughed up South Korean diplomats who were sent by their government to assist these refugees. 
   I call on Beijing to act in accordance with the international refugee conventions that it has signed and to end the disrespect that it has shown toward the diplomats of a major ally of the United States. 
   This resolution, put forward by my good friend, ED ROYCE of California, is particularly timely and essential with the approach of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Olympic hosts should not include oppressors of refugees. 
   The forced repatriation of North Korean refugees is both irresponsible and immoral. If ever there was a refugee population who faced the immediate threat of persecution upon return to their homeland, it is the tens of thousands of North Korean refugees now hiding in China. 
   The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, must also do a much better job in holding Beijing accountable for its reckless disregard of its obligations. If Beijing does not begin to address this urgent issue in a  responsible way, then there should be dire consequences. 
   Television viewers around the world next summer could possibly see on their screens the scene of a North Korean woman with her baby seeking safe haven in an athletes' dormitory at the Olympic village as Chinese police ruthlessly pursue her. 
   This resolution, therefore, Mr. Speaker, is of vital importance for the reaffirmation of our commitment to the protection of refugees and, most importantly, for the North Korean refugees themselves. 
   I rise in strong support of Mr. Royce's resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the author and the sponsor of this resolution, Mr. Royce of California.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3999, NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank my good friend from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the emergency route priority amendment, as mentioned by Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and this is the Mario Diaz-Balart amendment, which is provided for in today's rule for the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act. 
   I have the unique pleasure, Mr. Speaker, of representing over 265 miles of pristine Florida coastline from Miami Beach all the way south to Key West. But our paradise is complicated by the extreme vulnerability to hurricanes, especially in the Florida Keys. 
   Over 74,000 Keys residents are dependent on a single evacuation route, the Overseas Highway, a part of U.S. Highway 1, which runs many miles connecting a series of islands from Key Largo to Key West. A key, no pun intended, bottleneck in the evacuation route is the Long Key Bridge, which is the second longest bridge, next to the Seven Mile Bridge, in this stretch of highway. This is a 2 1/2 -mile-long bridge, and it marks the beginning of the approach to the first heavily populated Key, Key Largo; so almost all of the Florida Keys residents will be coming over this bridge if an evacuation is ordered. The Florida Department of Transportation has recently alerted my office to the fact that the Long Key Bridge is only rated as ``satisfactory'' in its structure. This means that it could be severely damaged in a category 3 hurricane. 
   As Mr. Diaz-Balart has pointed out in his remarks, the bridge was built in 1981, and it allows most of the population of the Florida Keys to evacuate to our mainland during hurricanes. If it were damaged in a storm, over 50,000 people could be trapped and, indeed, under water because most of the Keys are below sea level. Severe damage to the bridge would also likely cut off the water supply to most of the Florida Keys because it runs along the Overseas Highway. 
   Unfortunately, there are no definitive plans to fund the bridge, although there is a tentative date of the year 2012. This is because the needed improvements would cost $60 million. This includes replacing the present V-pier design to a more conventional configuration which would provide stronger structural integrity. It would also maintain the existing piers and top segments which are in good condition. 
   That is why the Mario Diaz-Balart emergency route amendment is so important to my congressional district. It's very simple, but it's a much-needed change to this legislation. It will emphasize the importance of public safety in prioritizing new highway bridge funding as well as including emergency evacuation routes as a reason to give a specific bridge risk-based priority for rehab or replacements. 
   Transportation infrastructure, especially bridges, play an important, a vital role during emergency situations, including our many natural disasters. In many coastal areas not only in the Florida Keys but, in fact, throughout the entire State of Florida and other hurricane-prone States, bridges provide the only mainland access for millions of residents and visitors alike. The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons emphasized the need for safe emergency evacuation routes when millions of Floridians faced mandatory evacuations, including the residents of the Florida Keys and other barrier islands. 
   This amendment simply emphasizes the importance of public safety as well as ensures that Americans have access to safe evacuation routes during times of impending disasters, and I hope that our colleagues give it their serious consideration.  
   I thank the gentleman, my colleague from Florida, for the time.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I deeply regret the effort today to postpone timely action on the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. For over a year, advocates of this agreement have worked tirelessly with our counterparts to bring it to the floor for an up-or-down vote. 
   We have the power to make a difference. We can make a difference not only here at home, but in Colombia and throughout the hemisphere as well. Colombia is a close ally, fighting our common enemy of drugs and antidemocratic regimes in the region. We must take a stand for our national security and against the growing influence of Iran and other rogue states in the hemisphere. 
   The choice is clear. This rule change is nothing but an abdication of responsibility and a decision to leave the hard decisions for another day. With the Colombian FTA, American businesses will benefit greatly, our ally will be strengthened, and our interests in the hemisphere will be secured. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``no'' against this procedural vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I fully support the amendme nt offered by my good friend from Virginia (Mr. Wolf). This amendment gives vital assistance for demining, counterterrorism, rule of law programs, funding for Iraq military training and international human rights. We must remain committed to assisting the development of Iraq into a nation that is capable of governing itself, sustaining itself, defending itself and independently taking all necessary actions to root out terrorists and militias that seek to undermine the transition to a free and sover eign Iraqi Government, continue to promote democracy and the rule of law, continue to provide necessary services to the people of Iraq and maintain the authority of the Government of Iraq in all parts of its national territory. 
   My colleagues seek to cut integral components of our effort for cooperation and coordination with Iraqi leaders. Mr. Wolf's amendment correctly is aimed at strengthening the Iraqi Government to make sure that that nation can truly become self-reliant and stable, and not coun t on the U.S. as a blank check any longer.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to begin by thanking Chairman Lowey, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Obey, and Mr. Lewis for their great cooperation and working with me to find an acceptable compromise on the important issues in this amendment. I am grateful for their agreement to support the amendment text before us today. 
   This amendment serves two basic purposes. First, it seeks to restore funding for two initiatives: it restores funding for the U.N. Democracy Fund at the adminis tration's requested $14 million level, which had been zeroed out in the committee report. 
   The Democracy Fund, an initiative proposed by President Bush in 2004, increases cooperation between democratic countries and supports new and transitional democracies. It has been successful in making grants to programs in more than 100 countries around the world to support civil education, voter registration, access to information, and democratic dialogue. 
   In recent weeks, I have been working with the chairman of Foreign Affairs, Chairman Lantos, and his staff to ensure that a $14 million authorization for the Democracy Fund stays intact in preconference meetings with the Senate on H.R. 1 and H.R. 982, the Advanced Democracy Act. 
   I am glad that this amendment provides us with another opportunity to continue our bipartisan support for this critical work. The amendment also would restore $6 million out of the $10 million requested by the administration for the U.N. Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiati ve. 
   This initiative, modeled on the Democracy Fund, is designed as a voluntarily funded, freestanding trust that will make technical assistance grants to promote positive environments for business and innovation around the world. 
   Second, in addition to restoring those deleted funds, this amendment will strike $20 million from the proposed U.S. contributions to the U.N. Development Program. The past 6 months have brought a series of very serious revelations and questions about the UNDP activities in North Korea, Mr. Chairman, a rogue regime under sanctions by the U.N. Security Council. 
   While we appreciate the fact that the program has been terminated in North Korea, there has not been sufficient investigation and cooperation from UNDP in answering questions that bear on the fundamental issues that are of national security interest to the United States.  
   The $20 million cut proposed in my amendment will send a clear signal about our demands and expectations for greater transparency and acc ountability from the United Nations Development Program while also continuing to make a substantial contribution to UNDP's core programs. 
   Again I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support for this important amendment.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend Congressman Smith of New Jersey and Mr. Stupak, which seeks to restore the Mexico City Policy. It is a longstanding guideline for receiving U.S. family planning assistance. 
   This policy, as we know, prevents U.S. funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. This standard is consistent with our domestic policy, as regulations prohibit taxpayer dollars from programs that support abortion as a method of family planning. 
   The Mexico City Policy applies the same standard of domestic funding to global family planning, and therefore reinforces the belief that the fundamental goal of family planning programs should be to reduce abortions. By eliminating the Mexico City Policy, we are devaluing the importance of other preventative methods of family planning. 
   As the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am seriously concerned about the effect that such a policy change would have on our ability to protect the respect for innocent human life and human rights worldwide.

   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the gentlelady from New York, the chair of the subcommittee, Ms. LOWEY, and my dear friend from Virginia, Mr. Wolf, for agreeing to accept this amendment and for their support and their leadership on this and other human rights issues. 
   I also want to recognize my good friends, my esteemed colleagues who joined me in offering this amendment: Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Stearns, Mr. McCaul, and Judge POE. 
   This amendment makes clear that the United States will not spend millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to support the travesty of the U.N. Human Rights Council, more appropriately named the Human Wrongs Council. It does not cut off U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular budget, but actually prohibits them from being used to support the Council in any way. 
   Two days ago the so-called U.N. Human Rights Council celebrated its first birthday by giving gifts to repressive dictators and Islamic radicals, by halting unfinished investigations into human rights conditions in Cuba and Belarus, and creating a permanent agenda item relating to Israel. 
   The actions against Israel took place as news reports documented the horrific actions by Hamas against innocent Palestinians, including those in Gaza clamoring to enter Israel. The Council has been fatally flawed from its inception in the year 2006, and has proven even more problematic than the already discredited U.N. Human Rights Commission that it was designated to replace.     
   Instead of becoming part of the solution, Mr. Chairman, the United Nations Human Rights Council continues to perpetuate intolerance, serving as a forum for hateful attacks against Israel by some of the worst violators of human rights. 
   To cite just one of many examples, the Iranian representative to the Human Rights Council stated on December 12 of last year: ``There is an Israeli holocaust against Palestinian people here on a daily basis for more than 60 years, which was already noted by three special sessions.'' This is a human rights activist? 
   In contrast, the Council has failed to condemn the genocide in Darfur, has failed to condemn the sprawling gulag in North Korea, has failed to condemn the political and human rights daily abuses in China and the bloody repression in Burma and Zimbabwe. 
   Simply put, the U.N. Human Rights Council is a failure. We were right to refuse to dignify this poisonous talk-shop with our membership, and we must refuse to support it with our tax dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield the balance of my time to my colleague from Florida (Mr. Stearns), who has taken for many years a leadership substance on this issue.
