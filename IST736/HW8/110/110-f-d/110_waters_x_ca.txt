   Ms. WATERS. I truly thank the gentleman from Florida for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $48 billion over the next 5 years for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. 
   Madam Speaker and Members, on June 27 stars of the screen, stage, and studio paid tribute to former South African leader Nelson Mandela.     
   Hollywood star Will Smith hosted a birthday celebration concert honoring Mr. Mandela who turned 90, along with nearly 50,000 cheering fans, in London's Hyde Park. 
   The event was organized to support Mandela's HIV/AIDS charity 46664, named for the number assigned him as a onetime political prisoner, and comes 20 years after another London concert on his behalf while he was still behind bars for his stand against apartheid. 
   ``Twenty years ago, London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom,'' a frail-looking Mr. Mandela told a waving crowd. ``Your voices carried across the water and inspired us in our prison cells far away,'' he said. ``As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, especially including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.'' 
   Indeed there is more work to be done. I was in South Africa a short while ago, and everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problems they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work. 
   The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. That is why I'm pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure.

   Ms. WATERS. This bill will strengthen the health care infrastructure in countries like South Africa and train at least 140,000 new health care professionals and workers for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care. The bill also includes prevention funds to stop the spread of HIV and treatment funds to allow infected individuals to live productive lives and continue to serve their communities. 
   This is an important bill. I thank again all of our leaders for the work that they have done to bring this bill before us.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I first would like to thank all of our leaders who were involved in the negotiations on this most important stimulus package. Despite the fact there are some differences and some things we would have liked to have seen differently, this was a good effort, and I think we all have to get behind this effort and move forward with it. I'm thankful for the work that the Speaker did in particular. 
   And I rise in support of the economic stimulus package before us today. It is urgently needed in light of home foreclosure rates that are 70 percent above the same time last year. Labor Department figures show that a sharp slowdown in job creation actually took place in December and the worst holiday season in over 5 years. 
   Americans need help, and I applaud Speaker Pelosi for working with the administration and Minority Leader Boehner to provide it to them and quickly. This package will provide rebates to 117 million households, the kind of broad-based relief required to help jump-start consumer spending and the economy. Individuals can look forward to up to $600 in tax relief, while married couples may get as much as $1,200 to meet their expenses, including skyrocketing costs of fueling their cars and heating their homes. 
   Equally critical, this package is not tilted toward the high income to the extent that the President's original proposal was. Indeed, thanks to Speaker Pelosi's efforts, the package includes tax relief of up to $300 for 35 million working individuals who earn too little to pay income taxes, a group that had been left out of the initial plan. Further, the bill will temporarily raise loan limits for the GSEs and the FHA, which will allow these entities to play an increased role in helping distressed homeowners across the country, especially in high-cost housing markets like my home State of California. As the lead sponsor of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007, I am pleased that the bill incorporates loan limit increases for loans written by the Federal Housing Administration. The reforms in H.R. 1852 are critical in addressing the current foreclosure crisis, and I look forward to ensuring enactment of other elements of this much-needed legislation. 
   There are a few critical measures to assist our Nation's lowest income households, those who are most likely to inject any assistance they receive directly into the economy, that I am disappointed were left out of the final stimulus package.  
   In particular, extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits and a 10 percent increase in Food Stamp benefits would provide critical assistance to the Nation's poor families. Moreover, both could start injecting more consumer purchasing power into the economy within 1 to 2 months, even faster than the planned rebate checks are likely to go out. A recent analysis by Economy.com found that for each dollar spent on extended Unemployment Insurance benefits, $1.64 in increased economic activity would be generated and for each dollar in increased food stamp benefits, $1.73 in new economic activity would be generated. This is substantial ``bang-for-the buck'' in fiscal stimulus. 
   Nonetheless, I recognize that Speaker PELOSI had to make some hard choices in negotiations with the Administration and our colleagues from across the aisle, who view appropriate economic stimulus very differently; therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this negotiated proposal.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much for yielding this time to me, Congressman Payne. 
   I rushed from my last appointment to be here because this is a day that we have waited for far too long. And I certainly appreciate all of the work that you have done, and certainly the work of Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., and the work of Members on both sides of the aisle. And Congressman Blunt is correct; we did coauthor this legislation I think some 6 years ago, but we have only been able to stick with this legislation because of one person, in my estimation, and that is Edith Bartley. She has walked these halls. She has lobbied. She has educated us. She has always been pleasant. She has been patient and cooperative. You couldn't have a better daughter. You couldn't have a better child. You couldn't have a better family member not only looking out for the family, but for all of the families who have not yet been treated fairly and compensated for what happened to them. 
   Mr. Speaker, as it was said, 9 years ago, on August 7, 1998, terrorists affiliated with al Qaeda bombed United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. These terrorist attacks were one of the first warnings of the threat posed by al Qaeda, the international terrorist organization that hijacked American airplanes and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 6 years ago. 
   The embassy bombings in Nairobi killed over 200 United States Embassy employees, 12 of whom were United States citizens, and injured thousands more. The embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania killed 11 employees and injured over 80 people. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 killed nearly 3,000 innocent people. 
   The United States Government provided compensation to the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that the United States be consistent and provide compensation to the families of the victims of the embassy bombings in East Africa 3 years earlier. 
   So, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. I offer my apology and the apology of many others because it has taken so long. My sympathies to the families of the victims of those embassy bombings, as well as all of the victims of al Qaeda's acts of terror. Let us move forward so that we can finally do the right thing.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to first thank Chairman Frank and all of the members of the Financial Services Committee, and particularly those members who serve on the subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. I'm thanking Members on both sides of the aisle for helping to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act, authorizes a $15 billion HUD administrative grant and loan program to State and local governments to purchase, rehabilitate and resell or rent foreclosed homes. To understand the urgent need to enact this legislation, one need only consider the sobering figures on foreclosures recently released by RealtyTrac, which show that foreclosure filings during the first quarter of 2008 are 112 percent higher than 1 year ago, and that actual bank repossessions of homes during March were a shocking 129 percent above March 2007. 
   The human reality behind these numbers is revealed if you visit, as I have the past year, cities and communities in cities like Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; or the San Bernardino and Stockton metropolitan areas in California, where block after block is dotted by foreclosed properties, many of them suffering from neglect or actual vandalism. These abandoned and foreclosed properties drag down the value of homes still occupied by working families, and contribute to a cascade effect whereby plummeting home prices erode the tax base of State and local governments and cause real estate related industries such as the construction trades to suffer. 
   States and most local governments must balance their budgets each year and, as a result, 20 States have already had to make or are proposing budget cuts due largely to revenue losses resulting from the subprime crisis, which further reduces demand in the economy and deepens the recession. 
   On April 10, the Financial Services Committee heard from Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston, Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland, and others, that despite severe physical constraints, many States and cities are already dedicating their own shrinking tax revenues to purchase foreclosed properties and attempt to stabilize these neighborhoods. But they are overwhelmed by the scale of the problem in comparison to their shrinking tax revenues. For this reason, the National Governors Association has stated that a ``one-time Federal funding commitment to support the acquisition and rehabilitation for foreclosed properties is vital.'' 
   The Governors are joined in their support for the stimulus contained in H.R. 5818 by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, and the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies. H.R. 5818 is also endorsed by nearly 40 civil rights, community development, labor and low income housing groups, including the AFL-CIO, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Services of America, the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and the National Foreclosure Prevention and Neighborhood Stabilization Task Force. 
   This bill targets assistance where it is most needed. The $7.5 billion in grants and $7.5 billion in loans would be allocated to States based on two factors: The number of foreclosures, and the number of subprime loans 90 days delinquent. This is then subject to a limited adjustment for median home prices, a bipartisan compromise that was worked out in mark-up with the committee's members from Ohio, which, like many midwestern States, has faced skyrocketing foreclosures but did not experience an extraordinary run up in housing prices. 
   Second, the bill puts flexible resources in the hands of government with the capacity to address the crisis and put funds on the street quickly enough to stimulate the economy. Rather than expect HUD to process plans from 1,200 entitlement jurisdictions, the balance we struck at mark-up was to allocate funding to States and to the Nation's largest 100 cities, largest 50 counties, and cities over 50,000 with especially high foreclosure rates. The areas of States outside of those cities and counties would be addressed in the State's plans. 
   Under the bill's timelines, fund obligation must begin within 6 months of enactment, be completed within a year, and fully spent within 2 years of enactment. This is no ``big government,'' immortal program, as our colleagues across the aisle suggest. Rather, it is a timely, targeted and temporary shot in the economy's arm, exactly where one is needed. 
   Indeed, using well-accepted construction activity multipliers, the National Foreclosure Prevention and Neighborhood Stabilization Task Force calculates that the bill's proposed $15 billion investment will generate at least $38 billion in direct and ripple effect economic activity nationwide, employ about 120,000 people, and restore nearly $225 million per year in local real estate tax collections. 
   Some Republicans have tried to frame this bill as a bailout bill for investors. This simply is not so. Government and their nonprofit partners will drive a hard bargain with property owners because they are highly incentivized to make this money go as far as possible in their efforts to stabilize neighborhoods where many of them have been working for years, and because they must pay the government back any funds used to purchase homes. 
   In no event, moreover, can they pay more than 110 percent of the average  home sale price in the area. Creaming of properties and ``sweetheart'' deals are prevented by the requirement that properties sit for 60 days before they are eligible. 
   What H.R. 5815 does make possible is for States, cities and counties to stabilize a few neighborhoods, especially low income ones, that are in serious danger of an overcorrection and rapid deterioration past the tipping point, where it becomes very difficult to turn them around. 
   I urge Members to hear the pleas of the Nation's governors, mayors, community-based organizations and ordinary citizens to provide this critical relief to stabilize neighborhoods and stimulate the economy. 
   The administration and my friends on the opposite side of the aisle in this Chamber argue that we cannot afford to respond. I would like to just remind this body of what Mr. Frank said earlier today, we afforded $30 billion to bail out Bear Stearns, and certainly we can afford half of that amount, $15 billion for the entire country. We simply cannot afford not to. 
   I urge passage of the Neighborhood Stabilization Act. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Chairman and Members, I would like to thank all of the Members who have come to the floor today in support of this legislation because they understand the devastation to neighborhoods all over this country. 
   I have listened very carefully to the arguments from the opposite side of the aisle, and none of them rise to the merit of being able to oppose this bill because they're substantive arguments. 
   First of all, I have heard Members on the opposite side of the aisle talk about taxes. They have talked about gasoline. They have talked about everything except what we are here to talk about: the fact that there has been a subprime meltdown in this country and many neighborhoods are devastated. We have homes that are being stripped of the copper. We have homes that have been boarded up with vandals inside those homes, oftentimes living inside those homes, with the weeds growing up in many of these properties, and the value of the homes in the neighborhood where people are attempting to maintain their homes is going down every day. 
   We had one Member on the opposite side of the aisle talk about how flush these cities are with money. Evidently, he has not looked at what is going on in the cities and States. Many of them are in deficit situations. They're in deficit situations because we're in this recession, this nonperforming economy under the leadership of the President of the United States where the price of food has risen, gasoline prices are up, and the subprime mess is fueling the problems of our economy. And with all of this that has taken place under this President and this administration, you would think that the Members on the opposite side of the aisle would want to come to the aid of their constituents. 
   We have talked about the $30 billion bailout under the Fed Chairman that was appointed by this President. And I am sure, since we did not get a call in the middle of the night to even discuss with us that the bailout was going to take place, I'm sure that the Fed Chairman called the President that appointed him. And I would give anything--I would place money on the line--to tell you that the President approved of that bailout. And so why not bail out the people who deserve to be helped? People, many of them who got into loans that were lured into these loans, lured into these mortgages by unscrupulous real estate brokers who  told them to just sign on the dotted line, by unscrupulous folks representing some of the financial institutions who said get into this ARM and when it resets, I will be there to help you refinance it, and, of course, they're not there. These people, many of them have lost these homes through no fault of their own. 
   But the neighborhoods are being devastated. We have information here that tells us how much crime will be fostered on the neighborhoods. As a matter of fact, what we have learned is that when there is one foreclosure, it leads to not only vandalism that affects the entire neighborhood, but it also increases the crime. This has all been documented. 
   I would think that the representatives who have been sent here by the people who have voted for them would want to be able to go home and say to their constituents, I understand what's going on in the neighborhoods; to say to their mayors and to say to their Governors and to say to their county commissioners, ``We are here to help.'' Yes, we are spending a lot of money on other things. As a matter of fact, many of the Members on the opposite side of the aisle, in a matter of hours, are going to vote for over $107 billion in supplemental funding to continue the war in Iraq.     
   Many of these Members have voted to give tax increases to the richest 1 percent in America. The least they could do is vote for the citizens and for their cities. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered read.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This manager's amendment is in the nature of a perfecting amendment that makes a few changes to the bill that I hope will be relatively uncontroversial. 
   First, as this bill has moved through the process, we have moved from a program that allocated all of the funds to States to administer to one that, as I described in my opening statement, distributes funds to States, certain metropolitan cities and large urban counties. 
   This amendment simply removes the State as the middle person in allocations to qualifying cities and counties which would instead receive direct allocations from HUD. This will expedite the distribution of funds which is critical in the context of economic stimulus. 
   Second, the amendment brings a definition of operating costs of housing purchased under the program, which is an eligible use under the grant component in line with similar uses in other HUD programs such as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This just clarifies what is and is not an eligible expense when an entity is operating a purchase property as rental property or preparing it for resale. 
   Finally, to further address the concerns that this bill somehow provides a bailout to lenders, the amendment caps the purchase price of foreclosed properties at the appraised price or 110 percent of the average local single family home price, whichever is less. This guards against property owners gaming the system to obtain inflated prices under the program. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Although I rise to claim time in opposition, I am not opposed to the amendment. 
   I think the ranking member of the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee has made a sound addition to the bill here. While, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we did not want HUD to get bogged down in processing 1,200 different plans from all the entitlement jurisdictions in the  HOME and CDBG programs, there is no question that the expertise at HUD to administer this bill's loan and rent program lies in the Community Planning and Development division of the agency. So I urge my colleagues to support Mrs. Capito's amendment to ensure that we don't create an unnecessary new bureaucracy if H.R. 5818 is passed into law.

   His subcommittee has done an enormous amount of valuable work examining this targeting issue, and I want to thank him for focusing attention on the issue of neighborhoods where there are large and growing concentrations of vacancies resulting from the foreclosure crisis. They're exactly the neighborhoods I mentioned in my opening statement, ones that face the prospect of reaching the tipping point of deterioration from which they may never recover. Stabilizing such neighborhoods is an especially daunting task for community leaders and organizations. 
   So I think it is entirely appropriate, as this amendment does, to require States, counties and cities in their plans to prioritize these foreclosures and vacancy hotspots. 
   Finally, I know that this is no academic exercise for Representative Kucinich in his role as subcommittee Chair. He's bringing hard experience to the table from the neighborhoods within his district in Cleveland. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, and I thank the Gentleman from California [Mr. GEORGE MILLER] for introducing this legislation and for bringing it to the Floor for workers in America. I am a proud original co-sponsor of H.R. 800. 
   H.R. 800 contains three very strong protections for unions. First, it streamlines the process for obtaining National Labor Relations Board certification when a majority of employees have signed up for representation. Second, it provides for easy referral to mediation and arbitration when an employer and a union cannot reach an agreement within 90 days of negotiations so that employees are guaranteed an opportunity to reach an agreement. Third, it enhances penalties for discrimination, unlawful discharge, and other violations of the labor laws. 
   According to a study conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, the probability of a pro-union worker being fired during an organizing campaign went up from half a percent in the period between 1970 and 1974 to one percent in the period between 1996 and 2000; between 2001 and 2005, this figure rose to 1.4 percent. America needs this legislation because workers are being mistreated and need strong and effective representation. 
   My State of California is home to the largest number of stakeholders in support of this legislation. Nationally, there were 15.4 million union members, and a little under half (7.5 million) lived in six states--California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. One of the main reasons why we need this legislation is because although these six states make up about half of the union members in the entire country, they only account for a mere one-third of the national wage and salary employment. 
   In California, there were 2,424,000 union members (16.5 percent of the state's workforce) in 2005 and 2,273,000 union members (or 15.7 percent of the state workforce) in 2006--which is the largest percentage in the country. 
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that nationally, in 2006, there were about 1.5 million wage and salary workers who were represented by a union--even though they were not members themselves. Therefore, this legislation will help America's workers even if they do not belong to a union. 
   This trend of retaliatory firing has played a major part in the sharp decline in organized labor. Organized labor went from 30 percent in the 1960s to just 13 percent in 2003--and during this period, America saw the largest upward redistribution of income in its history--according to a report by Human Rights Watch. 
   In addition, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 2005 and 2006, the percentage of national union members fell from 12.5 percent to 12 percent. The actual number of union members decreased by 326,000 in 2006 to 15.4 million, and there has been a steady rate of decline from 20.1 percent in 1983. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation is necessary and drafted to address very specific problems that organized labor faces. Livable wages, a decent work environment, and a fair dispute process are rights that we should all enjoy. 
   I support H.R. 800, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I give my statement on this legislation, I'd sincerely like to thank Mr. LAMAR SMITH, my colleague on the opposite side of the aisle who was the author of this legislation in the last Congress and who has worked with me so much and so well to bring this legislation before us today. I'm very thankful to him. We have 43 cosponsors on this bill, and I'd also like to thank Mr. RANDY FORBES and Mr. LUIS FORTU&#209;O who are on the opposite side of the aisle who worked with us on this bill; but all of the Members who came together to get this legislation to this point today are to be appreciated because it was somewhat controversial when Mr. Smith first brought the idea to us. And, of course, I would like to thank Judiciary Committee Chairman JOHN CONYERS for all of his support for this legislation. 
   This particular legislation takes us back 25 years after AIDS was discovered; the AIDS virus continues to spread. About 1.7 million Americans have been infected by HIV since the beginning of the epidemic, and there are 1.2 million Americans living with HIV today. Every year, there are 40,000 new HIV infections and 17,000 new AIDS-related deaths in the United States. 
   We need to take the threat of HIV/AIDS seriously and confront it in every institution of our society. That includes our Nation's prison system, and that is why this bill is so important. 
   The Stop AIDS in Prison Act requires the Federal Bureau of Prisons to develop a comprehensive policy to provide HIV testing, treatment and prevention for inmates in Federal prisons. The bill requires the Bureau of Prisons to test all prison inmates for HIV upon entering prison and again prior to release from prison, unless the inmate absolutely opts out of taking the test. 
   The bill requires HIV/AIDS prevention education for all inmates and comprehensive treatment for those inmates who test positive. Language was included to protect the confidentiality of inmate tests, diagnosis, and treatment and to require that inmates receive pre-test and post-test counseling so that they will understand the meaning of HIV test results. 
   In 2005, the Department of Justice reported that the rate of confirmed AIDS cases in prisons was three times higher than in the general population. The Department of Justice also reported that 2 percent of the State prison inmates and 1.1 percent of Federal prison inmates were known to be living with HIV/AIDS in 2003. 
   However, the actual rate of HIV infection in our Nation's prisons is simply unknown, and it could be considerably higher.     
   This is because prison officials do not consistently test prisoners for HIV. The only way to determine whether HIV has been spread among prisoners is to begin routine HIV testing of all prison inmates. This bill does that. 
   This bill has been endorsed by a number of prominent HIV/AIDS advocacy organizations, including AIDS Action, the AIDS Institute, the National Minority AIDS Council, the AIDS Health Care Foundation, the HIV Medicine Association, AIDS Project Los Angeles, and Bienestar; that happens to be a Latino community service and advocacy organization. The bill also has been endorsed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and even the Los Angeles Times. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to use this moment to just thank, again, Representative Lamar Smith. Also I would like to thank, again, Chairman John Conyers and Subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott and all of the Members who have signed on as cosponsors on this bill. 
   Again, as was mentioned by Congresswoman Barbara Lee, it certainly did start out a bit controversial. We had some of the advocacy groups who did not support this bill when we began to talk about doing something about AIDS in the prison system. As a matter of fact, questions were raised about everything from confidentiality to the cost to not knowing what to do about follow-up once they leave. But we have been able to answer all of those questions, and some of those who were opposed are now very, very strong supporters because they understand that we really do have to take additional steps to stem the tide of HIV and AIDS in this country. 
   You would think after 25 years and all of the education that we have tried to do, all the literature that has been written, that everyone would know everything that they need to know about HIV and AIDS. But it is not true. And one of the things that we had to consider was why was it there was an increase in HIV and AIDS with women, particularly minority women. And then we had to take a look at where it may be coming from. And though we don't have empirical data, we do think we are on the right track in helping to stem this tide because we do think that some of these infections are coming from those who may have been incarcerated. 
   Those who are incarcerated have nothing to fear. As a matter of fact, they should feel even protected by what we are doing because, despite the fact that we don't always discuss what is going on in prison, I think we have a pretty good idea. And this will help again to save the lives not only of inmates, but certainly the mates of inmates when they return into the general population. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (MINORITY AIDS INITIATIVE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, the first annual National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day was organized on February 23, 2001, with the message: Get educated, get involved, get tested. The National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day dates back to 1999 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention funded five national nonprofit organizations known then as the Community Capacity-Building Coalition, which are Concerned Black Men, Incorporated, of Philadelphia; Health Watch Information and Promotion Services, Jackson State University; Mississippi Urban Research Center; National Black Alcoholism and Addictions Council; and National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS. 
   On February 23, 2001, the CCBC organized the first annual National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. The date was changed to February 7, the following year, that was in 2002, and now it is recognized on February 7 of each year. 
   Madam Speaker and Members, many members of the Congressional Black Caucus and many Members of Congress have joined in the struggle and the fight to find a cure to prevent HIV and AIDS. I need to congratulate all of these Members right in the CBC. I need to congratulate BARBARA LEE, and ED TOWNS, and DONNA CHRISTENSEN, and Mr. Cummings, and ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, and DIANE WATSON, and so many more for the years of work that they have put in on dealing with HIV and AIDS, and HIV and AIDS in the minority community. 
   That is why back in 1998 I worked to establish the Minority Aids Initiative with the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Clinton administration. The Minority Aids Initiative provides grants for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs that serve minority communities and enables health care providers and community-based organizations to expand their capacity to serve these communities. 
   The initiative received an initial appropriation of $166 million in fiscal year 1999, and was funded at slightly less than $400 million in the most recent spending cycle. 
   However, the AIDS virus has continued to spread in the minority communities, and more needs to be done. This year I am calling for at least $610 million in funding to expand the Minority Aids Initiative, and redouble our efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has been especially devastating to African Americans and other communities of color. 
   But it is important to remember that HIV/AIDS affects us all. Over 1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS, and 24 to 27 percent of them do not know they are infected. That is why on Monday I introduced H.R. 822, the Routine HIV/AIDS Screening Coverage Act, a bill to require health insurance plans to cover routine HIV/AIDS tests under the same terms and conditions as other routine health screening. 
   Routine HIV/AIDS screening will allow thousands of African Americans and other infected individuals to find out about their infection, begin life-extending treatment and avoid spreading the virus to others. I also very soon will reintroduce the Stop AIDS in Prison Act, a bill to require routine HIV/AIDS screening of all Federal prison inmates upon entry, and prior to release from prison. The bill would also require HIV awareness education for all inmates and comprehensive treatment for those inmates who test positive. 
   Madam Speaker and Members, we here today come on the floor of Congress, all of us, to speak about this because it is a pandemic. It is a pandemic in the world that must be dealt with. We must lead the way here in the United States of America. 
   And for those of us whose communities are being overtaken by HIV and AIDS, we must stand up and be counted. We must ask for the money. We must demand the resources. We must take our heads out of the sand. We must call on all of the members of our community to accept personal responsibility. We must get our churches involved, all of our social clubs and organizations. Today we make a special appeal to them.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (HAITI -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I'd first like to thank my colleagues, Yvette Clark, Donna Edwards and Kendrick Meek, for taking the time to go to Haiti to be able to document and identify devastation that has taken place, and to bring that information back to the House of Representatives, to the Congress of the United States of America, so that all of us public policymakers can understand in the most profound way what is needed, what has taken place there, and what we can do to be of immediate assistance. 
   I would also like to take a moment to say to FEMA and to the elected officials in the gulf coast, who too, have been involved in dealing with the ravages of the recent hurricanes and storms, that we appreciate that you have demonstrated that you have learned so much from Katrina, and that you have done a great job in giving assistance to the victims of the recent storms in the gulf coast. I say that with all sincerity, because it is important for us to know and understand that magnificent work was done in giving assistance to the victims of the gulf coast. And I've watched very carefully what has been taking place in not only Galveston and in parts of Texas, but also as far as in Bay City of Mississippi. 
   So our hearts are with the people who have been the victims of the storms in that area, and we're very proud, and I'm very proud and pleased that the United States of America is able to do what it does and have learned so much from Katrina and are able to be of assistance in the way that they have been. 
   And having said that, we're generous people. We're people who not only have learned to deal with devastation in our own country, but we are a people who are forever ready to give a helping hand in other parts of the world. And certainly, what we have demonstrated in recent weeks right here in our own hemisphere in the Western Hemisphere for one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere is to be commended. But we've got to do more. 
   As I understand it, and having listened to my colleagues and having followed as closely as I possibly can, what has been taking place, we have spent about $20 million just from USAID alone. And then to listen to the stories about the armed services and the help that they're giving and the work that they're doing, I'm proud of my country. I'm proud of the assistance and the hand that we're extending to Haiti as we wrestle with the work that we must do in our own country and in the Gulf Coast. 
   Having said that, I have spent much of my time in the Congress of the United States paying attention to Haiti. I paid attention to Haiti because I know the history of Haiti, and I understand what the people of Haiti have been through historically. I have spent a lot of time in Haiti. I was there for the bicentennial and I flew up to Gonaives, where I watched a people who have been through so much celebrate its history and its independence, and I know the price that has been paid for that independence. 
   I also know that this is a people who have had to survive the dictatorships of Papa Doc and Baby Doc, and I know that this is a people who have seen a democratically elected president removed, and I know the history of our own country as we have restored the leadership to Haiti in recent history. And I also know the history of a coup d'etat, and a history of a people who have wrestled and fought and tried very hard to stabilize their country, despite all of the political unrest. 
   But, you know, we're at a time when it doesn't matter what position you took, whether some people thought that the democratically elected government of President Aristide should have remained or not. It's not about partisan politics at this time. This is about the people of Haiti. 
   It is not about even remembering what happened under Papa Doc and Baby Doc and La Tortue, none of that. This is about a people who have suffered far too much. My heart just goes out to the people of Haiti, people who work very hard, who get up every day and just scuffle and work hard to survive, a people who are not very literate. Only 53 percent of the people in this country can read or write. But they work hard. And whenever they are confronted with one more disaster, with one more disruption, and you think they possibly just cannot make it, they just keep going and they keep going. 
   Over the past month Haiti has been devastated by four deadly storms in rapid succession, Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, Tropical Storm Hanna and Hurricane Ike. And over 15,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed. And as of a week ago, they already documented that over 154 people had been killed. And today, I hear my colleague say that number may be up to about 600. And as the flood waters begin to recede, additional bodies continue to be found and buried. And tragically, the real death toll just may never be known. 
   According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, up to 800,000 people in Haiti are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. As of September 6, more than 100,000 people had taken refuge in temporary shelters, and this was before the onslaught of Hurricane Ike. Many roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed, and crops have been lost. There is now a desperate need for food and water and health services. 
   And I'm so sorry to hear about what has happened to the rice fields. Haiti, at one time, grew rice for its people. They exported rice that was grown in Haiti. They lost that over the years for a lot of reasons. Some of it was political. But to know that they had gotten back on the road to raising and growing rice again was extremely important. And to have these pictures that were shown to us today where now all of that has been destroyed is just almost too much to take, too much to endure. 
   I immediately asked my colleagues to join with me in requesting at least $300 million in appropriations for disaster assistance for Haiti following these devastating hurricanes. I did not know what the assessment would be, and we still don't know how much will be needed. But I knew immediately that it was going to be massive and that we needed to move very quickly, and that we need to appropriate substantial sums for Haiti.     
   And we will probably have an assessment in the very near future, but we need to get started right away to not only support Haiti through USAID, as is being done, but we have to add to it. You heard about the devastation. You heard about the destruction. I am just hopeful and prayerful that Haiti can survive as an island nation. The destruction is mammoth. And I believe that everything that we do and everything that we can think of doing must be done.  
   I know that the people of Haiti will get up every day, people who are sleeping on those rooftops, and they will fight to survive, they will fight to stay alive, and they believe, no matter what happens between the United States and Haiti, that we're their friends and that we will do whatever we can do to be of assistance to them. 
   So I would just, again, thank my colleagues for taking time to go there and to do this documentation and this eyewitness of what has taken place. 
   I would like to thank our ambassador there. Sanderson is a wonderful representative who has worked very hard. I would like to thank President Preval because he has been handed a task just as President of putting that nation back together and to stabilizing that government and to reorganizing and building that infrastructure. It's an awesome task even without experiencing these hurricanes. 
   So my prayers and my heart go out to President Preval and the government, and I would hope that we move very quickly to appropriate additional dollars. 
   And I will yield back the balance of my time. 
   Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (MISSING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENT ALERT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I would first like to thank the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. BOBBY SCOTT, for the time. And I thank him for making sure that this bill come to the floor tonight. 
   I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 6503, the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization Act. The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program is a Department of Justice program that helps local communities and law enforcement officials quickly identify persons with Alzheimer's disease who wander or who are missing and reunite them with their families. 
   Since its inception more than 10 years ago, this program has funded a national registry of more than 172,000 individuals at risk of wandering and has reunited over 12,000 wanderers with their families. 
   It is a highly successful program whereby 88 percent of registrants who wander are found within the first 4 hours of being reported missing. A total of 1,288 wandering incidents were reported to the program in 2007. The program has a 98 percent success rate in recovering enrollees who are reported missing. 
   There also are technology-based options to address wandering that should be considered for funding under the Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program. For example, personalized wristbands that emit a tracking signal can be used to locate wanderers. These wristbands, when combined with specially trained search and rescue teams, can reduce search times from hours and days to minutes. 
   Congress originally authorized $900,000 in appropriations for the Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program for 3 years, that is 1996 through 1998, but never reauthorized or updated the program. Since then, the program has continued to receive funding on a year-to-year basis, but funding has remained virtually flat since its inception. 
   H.R. 6503 reauthorizes updates and expands the Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program. The program authorizes up to $5 million per year in appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2015, a modest increase over the current appropriation of $1 million in fiscal year 2008. 
   The bill expands the program so as to allow the Department of Justice to award multiple competitive grants to nonprofit organizations. Preference would be given to national nonprofit organizations that have a direct link to patients and families of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 
   Finally, the bill specifies that the program will be operated under the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance. Currently, the program is operated under the Office of Juvenile Justice, which is obviously not the most appropriate agency for a program serving the elderly. 
   H.R. 6503 has 25 bipartisan cosponsors, including the cochairs of the Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force, Congressmen EDWARD MARKEY and CHRISTOPHER SMITH. The bill is also supported by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and Project Lifesaver. 
   Furthermore, on May 14, a diverse group of over 85 national State and local organizations sent a letter to the members of the House Judiciary Committee supporting this approach to the reauthorization of the Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program. 
   The Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program is a critical resource for first responders. It saves law enforcement officials valuable time, allowing them to focus on other national and local security concerns. It is critical that we reauthorize and expand this small but effective program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6503. And with that, I thank all of those who have worked to bring this bill to the floor.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr Speaker, I would like to thank Congresswoman Watson for taking time out this evening to honor and recognize Tina Allen. Tina Allen was a friend. As a matter of fact, she was a friend to so many of us women in the greater Los Angeles area. We held her in such high esteem. She was such a talented artist who is famous for the many works that were just identified by Congresswoman Watson. I have one of her sculptures in my home. And as I took another look at it, this weekend thinking about Tina, it's hard for me to reconcile that she has passed. 
   She was a very vibrant woman who was just full of life. She was so involved in the community. And she had been commissioned to do a bust of a community activist in my district, Ms. Lillian Mobley. And we were so looking forward to that. And so I joined with Congresswoman Watson and others in basically saying farewell to Tina and extending my sympathy to her children and to her family. She was a great artist who will be missed by us all. 
   I yield back and thank you for yielding time to me, Congresswoman Watson.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (MARKING THE END OF THE 4TH YEAR OF THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I would like to thank my friend from New York for taking this time out this evening and sharing it with those of us who feel a real need to come to the floor of this fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq and share with the people of America how we really feel about what is going on. 
   First, I think it is important for the people of America to know that some of us are listening. We hear what they are telling us. We know what their expectations are. The polls today are very, very clear about the overwhelming number of Americans who want us out of Iraq. 
   This war has truly taken a toll on this country: over 3,200 dead; 24,000 injured. And I don't mean just minor injuries. Serious injuries. It has been documented what is happening at Walter Reed, brain injuries, eyes gouged out, limbs lost. Serious injuries. And the information that was just shared with us, about 20 percent of the returning troops with mental illness. 
   Not only is it taking a toll on these young men and women who are sacrificing in this war; it is taking a toll on our domestic agenda, over $400 billion spent on this war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President now has a supplemental appropriation before this House asking for $100 billion more. The President recently came to us and told us he was going to increase the troops there by another 21,000, and a few days ago he added to that another 8,500. The requests keep coming: more troops, more money. And there is no end in sight. 
   The President has said we should listen to the generals on the ground. Whenever we try and share our feelings and give some advice, he rejects it out of hand. Well, he just got information from General Petraeus on the ground, and he said to the world there will be and can be no military solution. But this President continues to persist in increasing the military and misrepresenting to the American people what is going on. 
   With this request that he has made, the supplemental request, there are those who truly believe that we can ask him for progress reports and he will give us good information. I listened very carefully early this morning to what the President and all of those in his administration would say on this 4th-year anniversary. They simply are spinning the information about this war the way they have always spun the information about this war. 
   First of all, as it has been said over and over again, they told us we would be welcomed with open arms. They told us there were weapons of mass destruction. They told us we were making progress with the training of soldiers, Iraqi soldiers, and they were just around the corner, they would be prepared and willing to take over the security of that country. 
   Well, I listened as they did their spin this morning. In the middle of all of this carnage, in the middle of the fact that we wake up to more suicide bombings, more loss of American soldiers, and the expansion of the bombings in putting chlorine into the bombing and into the materials, they were spinning it again this morning saying we are making progress. And that is what I expect them to say if we give them the opportunity to tell us what progress is, come July, as it is indicated in the legislation that some would like to go forth from the floor. 
   We cannot depend on them to tell us the truth. We cannot depend on them to follow and honor benchmarks that a lot of people are alluding to. We cannot depend on this President to get out of Iraq as long as we are giving him the money. We said that we didn't support the surge, but there are those who could suggest that we turn around and  support the surge, $90 billion to support the expansion of this war. Why should he get out as long as we are giving him the money? 
   What are we supposed to accomplish? What are we trying to do? The President would tell you that somehow we are supposed to provide the security and we are supposed to train so that the Iraqis will be able to provide security. We are supposed to make the Shiites get along with the Sunnis and the Sunnis get along with the Kurds. I don't think so. I think that we don't understand the history. And I don't think that we understand, no matter who we think we are, we cannot forge the kinds of relationships that somehow we are going to stay there until we make people love and like each other and work together. 
   Who wants us in Iraq? They call us the occupiers. As a matter of fact, we find that legislators that are supposedly in this new democratic government, one was revealed this morning to have all kinds of weapons found at his house. All kinds of weapons. And they found traces of chemicals in his four automobiles. This is one of the so-called elected members of the parliament. They do not want us there. The Shiites don't want us there, the Sunnis don't want us there, the Kurds don't want us there. And we have our young people at risk. They are at risk. They are being attacked by the militias, and they are being attacked by the very police forces that are supposed to be on the ground helping to provide security. 
   Well, in the final analysis, our only response must be to have an exit strategy. The Out of Iraq Caucus that was organized 1 1/2 years ago did not say when we should get out; it did not tell the President exactly what the strategy should be. We simply created a platform for discussion and debate so that the Members of Congress would keep their eyes on the ball so that they would understand what was going on and not have information swept under the rug. We invited in speakers. We had generals to come in; we had writers to come in. We had many people come in and talk with us about what is going on there. But this President doesn't get it. He is intending to stay there until he does something called ``win,'' with young people losing their lives, the children of families all over America, not just from inner cities but most of them now we are finding coming from rural America. They will continue to die. 
   In another year we are going to have thousands that will be dead. In another year there will be thousands that will be injured. And the shame of it all is that they won't find the kind of medical care. They had a big article today and information about the homeless veterans returning from Iraq. They are homeless, they are not being cared for, they are not getting the benefits. But we are going to continue this war. I would submit to you it is time for a change. Bring our soldiers home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (RECOUNTING REASONS FOR VOTING IN FAVOR OF 2002 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the President began talking about going to war with Iraq. In the fall of 2002, with the midterm elections heating up, the President increasingly talked about the threat Iraq poses to the United States and its allies. On October 10, 2002, the House voted on H.J. Res. 114, the Authorization For Use of Military Force Against Iraq resolution. It passed the House by a vote of 296-133: 215 Republicans voted for the resolution, 6 voted against it. 81 Democrats voted for it, and 126 voted against it. 
   Madam Speaker, in light of what many of our Members know today, they perhaps would not have voted for that resolution. As a matter of fact, day in and day out as I talk with my colleagues, they recount all of that which was told to us by the President of the United States and others on the opposite side of the aisle, for the most part, about why it was so important to go to war with Iraq. 
   They told us there were weapons of mass destruction. They told us that the troop levels that they were sending were necessary. They told us about the cost of the war. They told us that oil revenues would be paying for the reconstruction. They told us we would be greeted as liberators. They told us we would be able to contain sectarian violence. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I have colleagues that are here this evening who will recount perhaps some of what they were being told and the way they trusted the Commander in Chief, they trusted our President. They were concerned about the safety and the security of our Nation. 
   So we have with us tonight some of the brightest, most hardworking, most respected Members of the Congress of the United States. They are going to remind us of what we were being told and how they came to their decision and what they are thinking now. 
   Leading that discussion will be my dear friend from Missouri, that is my hometown, my birthplace, who I have gotten to know very well. He is the Chair of one of the most important committees of this House, the Armed Services Committee, a highly respected gentleman, Representative IKE SKELTON. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California, not only for the statement that she has made this evening, but I believe that you are an example of one of our highly respected Members of Congress who trusted the President, who believed what he was saying when he offered all of the reasons why we should be going into the war, and to have lost your support, I think, is the kind of significance that everyone should have an appreciation for. 
   We have come to that point in time where supporters who believed in the President are now withdrawing their support and urging him to abandon the failed policies that took us into that war. 
   Next, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn). He is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, another one of our respected Members in this House who supported the Commander-in-Chief when he brought to us all of the flawed evidence, that we did not know was flawed at that time, and he has taken a lot of criticism for it, but he certainly has clarified his understanding now and he has a statement that he would like to bring forward this evening. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.

   We heard earlier from Members who had voted for the resolution to go to war, who have since changed their minds. Fifteen Members signed up for tonight, but some had to leave. They waited as long as they could. And so we will continue to bring to the floor those Members who have changed their minds. 
   Tonight not only do we have Ms. Lee, who just joined us, but we have Representative KEITH ELLISON from Minnesota, one of our newer Members who has been consistent on getting out of Iraq. I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise as Chair of the 76-member Out of Iraq Caucus, and I will be followed by many other members during this hour. I rise in support of our troops and in support of this resolution opposing the President's escalation of this war. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this resolution, hoping this will be a first step in ending this war and reuniting our troops with their families and loved ones. This is an unbinding resolution. The real test for this Congress is going to be whether or not we will continue to fund this war. 
   For nearly 4 years, our troops have served bravely and admirably in Iraq. Unfortunately, the President and his administration have decided to pursue a political agenda when it decided to push for an invasion of Iraq. The President ignored the advice of dozens of experts inside and outside the government about invading Iraq. For example, the administration ignored the intelligence community's opinions about the status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. The administration also ignored recommendations about the number of troops needed to secure Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein. In addition, the President and the administration ignored warnings about the difficulty and danger of occupying Iraq and that Iraq would likely break down into sectarian violence. 
   In short, the administration ignored everything that conflicted with its plan to invade Iraq. Unfortunately, no one has borne the burdens of the administration's Iraq narrow agenda more than our troops and their families. The decision to escalate the war, to send more than 21,000 additional troops to Iraq, will only increase the burden on our troops. Many of the troops serving in Iraq have served two, three, even four tours of duty. And of course the failed Iraq policy has resulted in the death of 3,109 U.S. troops, including 325 from my own State of California, and injury of more than 23,000 others. 
   Madam Speaker, many experts believe that the President's latest plan will not work, and early indications support that conclusion. About 5,000 troops have arrived in Baghdad since the President announced the plan in January, yet the violence and devastation in Iraq is increasing. It is estimated that more than 2,276 Iraqi civilians have died so far this year and that more than 1,000 Iraqi security forces and 33 U.S. servicemen have died in just the past week. We are sending thousands more troops to Iraq in what is now known to be a civil war. Sending more troops to Iraq is not the answer. The key to stabilization is bringing our troops home and renewing our commitment to diplomacy. 
   This resolution is the first step in reining in this President and his misguided policies. However, as many have noted, this is, again, an unbinding resolution. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the war, spending bills that will be considered in the coming months to enact meaningful changes to this failed policy and to finally bring our troops home. The future of the entire Middle East is at stake. 
   The President does not appear to understand or appreciate the situation in Iraq is deteriorating each day. We are losing; however, we can win. And we will win by using leadership to engage and unite rather than attempting to overpower and conquer. Who are we fighting? The Sunnis, the Kurds, the Shias? Who are the insurgents? Some Sunnis, some Shias, some Kurds? Who are the terrorists? Shias, Sunnis, Kurds, Syrians, Iranians? Who are we fighting? I don't think our soldiers know, and I am not so sure this administration has really given the kind of deep thought and consideration as to who we are really fighting.  
   Diplomacy is the only answer. Today, we must oppose this escalation. However, I have no choice but in the final analysis to oppose continued funding of the American taxpayers' dollars to the war giant whose appetite cannot be satisfied, but in the interest of peace, must be denied. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. BARNEY FRANK, for all of the time and attention he has placed on making this our number one priority, dealing with the aftermath of Katrina. He said to me and to all of the Members of my subcommittee, ``Move as quickly as you possibly can. Get the hearings going. Let's get a bill to the floor.'' And because of his interest and because of his support, we are here today on the floor indeed addressing many of those issues that should have been addressed a long time ago, and I thank Mr. Frank so very much for that. 
   It has been exactly 2 weeks since the Committee on Financial Services considered H.R. 1227, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007. By a vote of 50-16, the committee passed the bill. I want to thank again Chairman Frank for supporting the bill through markup. I want to thank the members of our committee from both sides of the aisle who voted for this bill. 
   There are also many Members of Congress who have expressed major concerns about the rebuilding process in the gulf region post-Katrina and support this bill. 
   This bill addresses many of the obstacles to the rebuilding process in the gulf region. Prior to consideration of this bill, the Committee on Financial Services held hearings on post-Katrina housing issues, followed by 2 days of subcommittee field hearings in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Gulfport, Mississippi. 
   The bill before you today represents consensus on one major issue; that is, for the rebuilding process in the gulf region to ever begin, we need to address the affordable housing crisis in the gulf region by returning people to their homes. Whether it is a home in need of major repair, a public housing unit damaged by the storm, or a home totally destroyed, every person who desires to live in the gulf region must be given an opportunity to rebuild and to return home. 
   We learned through hours of testimony that the reasons for failure in the gulf region related to the rebuilding process were often bureaucratic, administrative, as well as a consequence of inadequate poststorm planning by the Federal Government. 
   The hurricanes hit the gulf region in August of 2005, leaving behind unparalleled devastation. Many have acknowledged their frustration with the speed and pace of the recovery. Others realize that the efforts of Congress to provide $110 billion to the gulf region have not necessarily resulted in money into the right people's hands, and I could not agree more. 
   However, this bill does not place blame on anyone, but rather recognizes the need to bring efficiency to the process, whether through administration of the Road Home program or the Federal Public Housing program, so that persons in need are assisted with the financial resources that we approved for them months ago. 
   I had one goal when I introduced this bill, and that was to see the gulf region rebuilt, while addressing the affordable housing crisis in the region. The hurricanes destroyed nearly 300,000 units of housing in the gulf region, affordable rental units, homes of low- and moderate-income families, and public housing. The hurricanes did not discriminate when it came to destroying the housing stock in the gulf region. No income group was spared. Whether the family lived in public housing, high-priced homes, or affordable rental housing in the gulf region, they were all affected alike. Many of the residents of the major affected areas like New Orleans and elsewhere have not recovered from the storms, and thousands are still displaced and living in other parts of the country months after the storms rather than their formal communities. While all of these persons may not choose to return or even wish to return, we must provide those who do with an opportunity to return. 
   H.R. 1227 is about rebuilding communities to allow people to return to the gulf region. We should not have to rebuild communities one at a time in the gulf, and in some cases that is what it will take. What would be worse is not rebuilding any of the communities in the gulf region, and that is the path that we are currently on. Housing is the key to everything in the gulf region. No housing means zero communities. No communities will mean that rebuilding is impossible in the gulf region. 
   This bill will address a number of issues. The build resolves the HUD-FEMA dispute by allowing the Hazard Mitigation Fund to be combined with the Community Development Block Grant funds. In addition, the bill requires monthly reports by the State of Louisiana on number of households assisted through the programs funded with CDBG funds for the Road Home program. 
   By eliminating the prohibition against the match requirement, CDBG supplemental funds can be used in conjunction with other Federal programs, including those administered by FEMA. In addition, the bill also provides for reimbursements related to an entitlement community's use of the Community Development Block Grant funds to provide rental assistance to displaced residents. 
   Public housing because of the hurricanes. Many public housing residents are displaced with no reasonable housing option. Living in trailers and doubling up do not qualify as reasonable housing options. This bill would provide a means to return for the greater of 3,000 or those who respond to the survey who are former New Orleans public housing residents. It also establishes the one-for-one replacement principle by requiring a plan to be approved by HUD and the residents prior to any wholesale demolition or redevelopment efforts of public housing units. 
   Under the bill, HUD is required to complete a survey of displaced public housing residents to determine whether they want to return to public housing in New Orleans. In addition, the bill requires HUD to report on any proposed conversion of public housing units located in areas affected by the hurricane, as well as comply with the bill's other requirements related to public housing. 
   The bill addresses disaster vouchers and project-based rental assistance. It extends disaster vouchers for 3 months until January 2008. Project-based vouchers would be protected where a project was destroyed or is in need of substantial rehabilitation. The bill clarifies the voucher allocation formula by requiring HUD to make appropriate adjustments consistent with the funding year 2007 continuing resolution. In addition, the bill requires a number of proactive measures related to vouchers that will ensure that no one is left without access to housing as a result of hurricanes.     
   Further, title IV of the bill would provide for the reimbursement of landlords who suffered damages related to  commitments made by FEMA in conjunction with providing rental units to displaced residents. Without their commitment to house displaced families, what can best be described as a tragedy would have become a 21st-century horror story. 
   I am pleased that the Members of the House are in the position to speed up the recovery and rebuilding process in the gulf region by supporting this bill. This bill is a small investment to make sure that the $110 billion we have spent thus far is not squandered. Unfortunately, renters and homeowners alike have suffered in the gulf region for too many months. I believe this bill will bring much needed relief to those persons who have suffered the most. 
   Again, I would like to thank Barney Frank, our chairman, for the tremendous work that he has done. I would like to thank all of the members of our subcommittee and of the entire committee, and I want to thank Mrs. Biggert, the ranking member on the opposite side of the aisle, for the cooperation. She went to New Orleans. She sat in those hearings, and she visited those public housing projects, and she has as much knowledge about this as anyone. 
   So I am thankful that we are at this point today, and I would ask for an ``aye'' vote on this legislation.

I know she was down there days after the hurricane hit, and I know of her passion.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I know of her concern about making sure that all the residents have the opportunity to return. 
   In our bill we have notification for return by August 1, and they have until October to honor the August 1 notification. 
   Now, let me just say that we crafted this for several reasons. One is we did not want to be in the position of taking people out of where they are living now and forcing them to have to take their children out of school, but we wanted them to return in time to enroll the children in school for the semester starting in September. So we think that accomplishes that. And I know that you are concerned about all the people having adequate time. 
   Let me tell you something else that was taken into consideration. Mr. Neugebauer, who was with us, has past experience as a developer-contractor type. He made it very clear that when you rehab a unit, that if it is not occupied by a certain length of time, then you are going to have to go back 6 months later and put the same amount of dollars in again to rehab that unit that has been sitting vacant; because of the moisture and everything in the area, that you just cannot maintain the properties without them being inhabited. 
   So for those two reasons, what we think makes good sense in terms of giving people an adequate period of time, and so that we don't have to spend additional money to rehab a unit the second time, we think that this would do well for those residents.

   Ms. WATERS. No, I am not aware of that, Congresswoman. What I do know is this: We have up to $150,000 in subsidy for homeowners to rebuild their homes. Some qualify for the entire amount, others qualify for different amounts based on whether or not they had insurance or whether or not there are other deductibles. My understanding is that if they decide not to come back, that they can sell their properties, and it is supposed to be at fair market value.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   This bill is about stabilizing families who have been displaced because of a natural disaster. These are people who are trying to return home. The people that he is referring to are people who come from various walks of life. Some of them do work, even though they live in public housing. Some of them are on fixed income, some are elderly, some are disabled and some of them are in welfare programs already. 
   This amendment is not needed. It is not proper. It is not the time that should be utilized to try and do something that really has already been taken care of in welfare reform. We should be about the business of returning people to their homes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver).

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, in closing on this opposition, I would simply like to say, I think that my colleagues have made a wonderful case for why we should not support this amendment. 
   And let me just say that this amendment is not in the spirit of the work that has been done on this bill. We have had wonderful cooperation with Ranking Member Bachus, Ranking Member of the subcommittee BIGGERT, and Mr. Neugebauer, who all attended the hearing and participated in the tours. And I think that everybody is bending over backwards to do the right thing. 
   We are not trying to penalize people, we are not trying to accuse people of trying to get something for nothing, we are not trying to treat people differently than we treat others. And I think this has been demonstrated throughout our work. 
   So the case that has been made here and the comparisons that have been made are legitimate. And I think you can see very clearly that there is some very deep feelings about any attempt to treat people differently, to try and penalize them in any unfair way, to try and put another welfare reform bill on top of the welfare reform bill that we already have that people are involved in. And I think that my colleagues in this Congress, too, will understand that. 
   I suppose I could always say to the gentleman, in the interest of us working together, perhaps you should withdraw the amendment, but that is not mine to say. Mine simply is to say that I am opposed to the amendment. I think it is disruptive, I think that it is polarizing, and I think it is not the kind of amendment we would like to see on a bill where we have had such tremendous cooperation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   First let me thank Mrs. Biggert for all the work that she has done in helping us to get this bill to the floor, and the time that she has taken to pay attention to this issue. And I certainly respect her thinking on this issue and the fact that she was there, she went through the units, she saw them. But I must respectfully disagree. 
   I must disagree because not only did we have 18,000 individuals on the waiting lists, waiting for public housing units; yes, these units were boarded up, these units were boarded up, and there had been a promise that there would be redevelopment that had not taken place. Not only do you have 18,000 on the waiting list, do you realize that many of the people that have been displaced because of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita are folks who were working, who had jobs? They lost their homes, they lost their jobs. They are living in temporary situations. They are in Houston, they are in Atlanta, they are in cities in Florida. They are all over. They now may qualify for public housing based on the fact that they have lost on their jobs. They want to return, they want to come back, and they should have an opportunity to apply for and receive public housing units that should be available to them. 
   So let me just say that we should have one-for-one replacement because it is needed. People are standing in line. They were standing in line before Katrina; they will be standing in line after Katrina. And, Mrs. Biggert, if you remember, the mayor of the city of New Orleans said he would love to contract for 1,000 units to have places for people who want to come back to New Orleans to work. 
   We are unleashing the possibilities for infrastructure rebuilding, with  some of the match requirements having been modified in the way that we have done them. They want to get started with the building, And people need places to live. So he would like to have units for people to come back and work in. When these units are replaced, we have enough people who want to live in them. And so it is not a fair way to determine how many units get replaced by simply saying only those that were occupied prior to Katrina, because that waiting list is a reminder to all of us of how badly those units are needed 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman and Members, I would like to reiterate something that the gentleman from North Carolina just said, and that is the fact that we are not trying to stop development. As a matter of fact, what we are doing is restoring units so that people can have some place to return. Their lives are in a temporary state of existence. Our residents that we talked to said they would be happy to work with the housing authority and HUD to talk about the future development. So I just wanted to make that clear.

   I am tired of the headlines at the end of one of these periods of time when the temporary assistance has run out, the headlines that say all of those people out there who are living in temporary situations are going to have to get off, they will not be supported any more, that their assistance has run out, and then legislators go running to beat up on FEMA. And then FEMA, after a few days or so, will make another extension. Time out. It is time for us to help people get some kind of permanency to their existence. This amendment will do that. 
   This amendment will simply say for those people who are living in trailers and all of this temporary housing, some of it is really not fit to live in, in places where we are spending money with the temporary vouchers, will now be given the opportunity with the passage of this amendment and this legislation to begin to reorder their lives and to go ahead and come home and get jobs, jobs that are needed, not only by those families but the infrastructures that need to be rebuilt by those people who will be there to do these jobs. All of this can happen with this kind of permanent voucher. 
   I think it is important to note, it has been said here that these vouchers will be given only to those people who are eligible for them. When they are no longer eligible, they will cease to exist. I don't know how you can be any fairer than that. 
   So we are talking about moving from temporary status to permanent status. When you don't need it any more, it is gone.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank the congresswoman from Ohio for initiating this memorial moment in the Congress of the United States for JULIA CARSON. This is a very special and important time because we're here this evening to talk about a woman that we truly loved and a woman who gave so much in public service to her country. I know that her family's saddened by her loss because it is a great loss. 
   She has been referred to this evening as a jewel, as the queen, and I came to understand this quite some time ago. 
   I've known JULIA for many years, long before I came to Congress and long before she came to Congress. I served in the State legislature of California, and she was a State legislator also, and like Diane Watson and others, we all worked with the Conference of State Legislators and the Conference of Black State Legislators. And so she knew legislators from all over the country. 
   And after I came here, I kept in contact with JULIA, and when she ran for office, she called me and she told me that she wanted me to help her. I thought she wanted me to raise some money or maybe come someplace to do something. And after talking with her for a few minutes, she made it very clear she wanted me to get Muhammad Ali to come to help her out. She didn't want me. She wanted Muhammad Ali, and so she said, Well, you know him, don't you? And I said, Yes, I do. She said, Well, if I could get Muhammad Ali here, then that would seal the deal. That's exactly what I need. 
   And of course, I asked him and he went to campaign with her, and he often asked after that how she was doing. And his award-winning photographer, Mr. Howard Binghan, would oftentimes ask me how she was doing, what she was doing so he could report to Muhammad Ali how his candidate that he had helped to win that election was doing in the Congress of the United States of America. 
   Well, let me just say, she was doing wonderfully well legislatively. Some people have referred to not only the fact that she was responsible for the recognition that Rosa Parks got getting the gold medal, but she was working on some tremendous legislation. And as I stand here before you this evening as the Chair of that Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, her legislation is really before us. It is known as HEARTH. It means the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act. And, you know, we've got to pass that legislation, and we've got to pass it, that is, H.R. 840, in the way that she wants it passed. 
   She was expanding the definition of homelessness. She was expanding it so that more people, many of whom who were not considered homeless, we should be qualifying for homeless assistance, that did not get it, could now be drawn in with this legislation. 
   So, it is important for all of us to give support to the work that she was involved in because, again, this very special woman really did not suffer fools. I mean, I know that you've heard the story about the time she stepped on the elevator and another Member of Congress, who had not been here maybe quite as long as JULIA, said to JULIA when she stepped on the elevator, This elevator is for Members of Congress. And of course, she got the look that only JULIA can give, and told somebody, Close the door, because that's how she handled someone who did not have the sense to be gracious enough to whomever was getting on the elevator, but certainly she should have known who her colleagues were getting on the elevator. 
   But there are many stories you will hear about JULIA CARSON, because not only was she brilliant, she had this sense of humor and she had this wit that was just undeniable. And of all of the people who spoke at Rosa Parks' funeral, and I was at the funeral in Washington, D.C., when JULIA spoke, she was the most engaging, the most memorable, the one that really caught the attention of everyone at that service.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (PUBLIC HOUSING IN NEW ORLEANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker and Members, I rise this evening to basically talk about what is happening in New Orleans and the fact that the city council is going to take a vote on Thursday to determine whether or not they're going to dismantle the big four public housing developments in that city. If they dismantle these public housing units, the City of New Orleans will lose 4,500 units. 
   These units have been boarded up for 2 years. The citizens who lived in these units were evacuated as a result of Katrina and Rita. They are now living in other cities, Houston and Dallas and Austin and Atlanta, all over the place, and they thought they would be able to return once these units were rehabbed. 
   These units, many of them, were not destroyed. Some of them had minimal damage. For example, the one housing development, La Fete, only had water damage on the first level. And they could have not only rehabbed that first level of La Fete projects, they could have opened up those other units, but  they did not. They have been boarded up. And people's lives have been in limbo living in these other cities, without the opportunity to come home and without the support that they needed. 
   In my committee, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, we worked and we put together a bill, H.R. 1227. That bill passed out of that committee and off the floor in March, and we sent it over to the Senate, where it has languished. 
   But basically, that bill laid out not only the fact that we would do a survey, because HUD was saying, well, many of the people had left, they did not want to come back. In that bill, we asked for a survey to be taken. We also placed in that bill that 3,000 units would be rehabbed right away, people would be given an opportunity to come back who wanted to come back, then the residents would be involved, working with HUD and HANO, that is the local housing authority, and the City of New Orleans to talk about the future of public housing development, what they would like to see. 
   We are not against redevelopment. We think that there should be planned development. We think that, first of all, they should look at these units and see which of them should remain. They should work with the residents and the local elected officials to talk about what would be redeveloped. And we were very surprised. We were very surprised when just a few days ago they started to dismantle the ``Big Four'' public housing units. 
   Well, because they started, two different entities went ahead and got restraining orders. They have been working with a non-profit group, the Advancement Project, and Ms. Tracy Washington and Mr. Bill Quigley, two lawyers that got involved and got a restraining order to stop the bulldozers. And then the AFL-CIO that had been working on one of the big developments known in New Orleans to stop that development. So now a lot of people have gotten involved. 
   The conservancy got involved because some of these are historic properties. And now the city council, it has been thrown into their laps because when they started to look at what HUD was doing in dismantling, they found that they were breaking any number of laws. They had not gotten the permits, and perhaps they don't even have the legal authority by which to do it because they had taken over these public housing projects. They were in receivership. But the time frame for the receivership had run out. And so we don't even know if they have the authority. 
   So now we have at least one restraining order that remains and the city council that is going to take a vote about each of those. AFL-CIO was involved in the one called St. Bernard, one of the biggest ones. 
   I have drafted a letter to the members of the city council explaining to them what we thought was an arrangement that we had worked out with the HUD Secretary, Mr. Jackson, that would do the rehab of a limited number of units and involve the tenants and the plan for the redevelopment of all these units. We are surprised they want to bulldoze them. We are very surprised because homelessness has doubled in New Orleans. There are no rental units. Many of those units were destroyed. People are still living in FEMA's trailers. And to think that they would dismantle 4,500 units of public housing is unconscionable when people are looking for places to live. 
   So I have developed a letter that is going to the members of the city council and will try to engage them as much as I can to explain what we have done here. We also asked Speaker Pelosi, along with Senator Reid, to put together a letter asking the President not to dismantle these units. That letter has gone out. My letter is going out. The telephone calls are going forth. But it is important for the people of this country to understand what is going on. 
   There were rumors following Rita and Katrina that perhaps some people wanted to change the make-up of New Orleans. Some people wanted to get rid of the poor people and thought that all of that city should really become the tourist attraction with all of the hotels and the gambling and all of the other things, and workers should live outside and not inside New Orleans. And some people think that they are carrying out that kind of a mission and that kind of program. I would just ask the Secretary to not demolish these public housing units. It is Christmastime. To give to the people of New Orleans a Christmas present of tearing down these units is unconscionable.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   First, I would like to congratulate Mr. Taylor not only for his passion, but for all of the work that he has done to try and help restore the gulf coast and his town and his city, and to get the kind of development that is necessary for people to restore their lives. He has worked very hard, as other Members of the gulf coast have. They were on the floor today, Mr. Melancon, Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Taylor, trying to make the case that this gulf coast catastrophe should not be penalized. 
   We do not know why and they do not know why they would be prohibited from using their CDBG, Community Development Block Grant, funds as a match. It is unheard of, it is unprecedented that any town, any city, any region that has been hit by this kind of disaster, and there is no other like it in the history of this country, would be prohibited from using as a match the Community Development Block Grant funds. 
   These communities have been virtually destroyed, their city halls, their water systems, their schools, their hospitals. They do not have any money. They are cash strapped. They do not have any money to use as a match, and we do not know why they would be singled out with this disaster and told that they could not use Community Development Block Grant funds. This is not new money. This would simply allow them to use that CDBG money as a match. 
   I would ask that this amendment be rejected, and I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to introduce the real author of this legislation, a gentleman who has worked very, very hard on the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007, an extremely important bill that will provide housing for Native Hawaiians who have been without decent, safe and secure housing for far too long.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I thank the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). She had been very passionate about what we were doing on the last legislation, and she took this opportunity, not only in support of this legislation, but to add some remarks for the record on behalf of the people of Houston, and I appreciate that. 
   Let me just say that I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Frank, for helping to focus our agenda in my subcommittee and in our overall committee, dealing with these very important housing issues, many of them that have been left unattended for far too long. 
   I want to thank Mr. Renzi for his attention to housing not only for Hawaiian Native Americans, but for Native Americans in Arizona where I had the opportunity to visit with him, where he is doing an awful lot for housing. 
   And so I am very pleased and proud about our Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, about the overall committee, and the way that we have been able to move so quickly and to have an agenda that we could bring to this floor on behalf of people who need us desperately, housing crises that exist not only in Hawaii but in other parts of the United States. And this is a representation of the work that we will be doing on this issue. 
   I know, again, that Mr. Abercrombie has been working very hard. Ms. Hirono came here with this on her agenda, and I just thank them all for being here on the floor with us this afternoon, and helping people to understand how appreciative they are for our help. 
   I would like to say that in addition to the work that he has done, he has invited many of us on more than one occasion not only to visit, but to understand that it is not just simply a beautiful island where people come to vacation. There are people who live there. There are people who live there. There are people who work there. There are people who need our assistance, people who have been without housing that they can afford for a long time. 
   And so, again, the work not only of our chairman and the members of my subcommittee, but the cooperation that we have had on the opposite side of the aisle, led by Mr. Renzi, is what gets us to this point today. 
   And I would urge all of my colleagues to please support this legislation. It is so important.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have worked with Mr. Neugebauer, and he has been exceptionally cooperative, understanding the plight of the poor and those people who have been displaced who were victims of Katrina and Rita, and I am convinced, having listened to this discussion and this debate, that there is simply a misunderstanding, because I don't think that he intends for those people who were already assisted by HUD, those people, for example, who were living in section 8 housing, they were renting from landlords and the building was destroyed, to somehow not be permanently assisted and get back on their section 8. 
   I don't think that he means that those people who were in public housing units who were assisted by HUD, if their unit does not get repaired, I don't think he means that they should not have a section 8. I don't think he means that for the disabled. I don't think he means that for the homeless. 
   So I am going to chalk this up to a misunderstanding and miscommunication, and, as we continue this debate, I hope that we are able to help my colleague on the opposite side of the aisle understand what he is proposing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think when the gentleman spoke, he said the people did not seem to be taking the first step to help themselves. That is an insult. I reject it. I speak on their behalf.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   I am so overwhelmed with the gentleman's statement that would deny to the people of New Orleans basic assistance that would allow them to use their Community Development Block Grant money as match, no new money, but simply the money that has already been allocated to them to be used as a match to FEMA money in order to help the area move forward with reconstruction, redevelopment and getting people's lives together. 
   I do not think that most people in America would believe that there was something wrong with giving this basic kind of assistance. Here we have cities where the city halls have been destroyed, water systems have been destroyed, schools, hospitals, roads, sewer systems, police departments, and we would then deny them the opportunity to use money that has already been granted as matching money so they could make use of the FEMA money that they are eligible for? I cannot believe that the gentleman would want to do that. 
   I am adamantly opposed to this amendment. It is one of the most mean-spirited amendments that I have heard that has been attempted to be attached to the bill that I have introduced. I would ask my colleagues to reject it out of hand. It does not make good sense. We do not gain anything from it. 
   We have not heard anybody come to this floor from the opposite side of the aisle, and certainly this gentleman, talk about fraud and abuse by Halliburton or any of those companies that are known to be ripping off the government, and here we have a Member of  this floor who would come to the floor and a Member of this Congress who would come to the floor and suggest to us that they may misuse it, they may abuse it. I do not think we want to entertain that. I do not think we want to be a part of denying basic help to people who need it so desperately. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Miller-Waters-Green amendment to H.R. 3074. On June 22, 2007, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, which I chair, held a hearing on homeowner down payment assistance programs. That hearing provided a window into down payment assistance programs that I had not seen before. 
   The hearing was prompted by the issuance of the HUD proposed rule on May 11, 2007, to terminate down payment assistance programs. I applaud HUD for extending the comment period for the proposed rule, but that is not enough. 
   Down payment assistance provided by charitable organizations to low- and moderate-income individuals and families to purchase homes has been a mainstay of HUD and FHA since 1999. In fact, we heard testimony that 30 to 40 percent of FHA loans used some type of down payment assistance. 
   What was even more astonishing was that HUD proposed a similar rule in 1999, only to have never finalized it. Indeed, HUD's failure to finalize a rule gave de facto approval for the continuation of many down payment assistance programs. 
   Down payment assistance is often used in conjunction with HUD's mortgage insurance under the 203(b) program administered by FHA. Down payment assistance programs have helped nearly 1 million low- and moderate-income persons become homeowners, providing an instant source of equity for them. Homeownership would be out of reach to thousands of homeowners without down payment assistance programs. 
   Unfortunately, HUD's issuance of the proposed rule on May 11, 2007, would eliminate the use of down payment assistance programs. FHA opposes the use of direct or indirect funding provided from the sale of property, and that is fine. But an across-the-board rejection of all down payment assistance programs without further review, analysis or clarification from HUD is unacceptable. 
   Down payment assistance programs do not need to be the scapegoat for, as what one HUD called it, the ``looming shortfall'' in HUD's fiscal year 2008 budget. I believe if HUD is left to its own devices, this is exactly what will happen to down payment assistance programs. 
   I support down payment assistance programs meeting Federal requirements. Therefore, I ask that you join Gary Miller, Al Green and me in supporting the amendment to prohibit HUD from implementing the proposed rule with any funds from this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. First I would like to thank Chairman Frank for the extraordinary work he has put into making sure we address this financial crisis, and do it in a way that will certainly protect our homeowners who are at risk. 
   There are a number of Members who have been worried about whether or not this bill is going to protect our citizens on Main Street, as they refer to it. I worked with Chairman Frank and others on the modifying of loans portions of this bill. We have three ways by which these loans can be modified. People forget that when we buy up this toxic paper, when we buy up these nonperforming loans, we are in charge. Not only can we write down the principal, we can write down the interest. We can do the kind of loan modification that we have been urging the Hope Now Alliance to get done. 
   In addition to that, we are coordinating the work of all of the agencies that own paper, whether it is the FDIC or either of the GSEs, Fannie or Freddie. Remember, we own them now. We will be able to coordinate and set some standards and be able to do again the kind of loan modification that takes into consideration whatever the circumstances are of the particular homeowner. And in some cases, we will provide a loan guarantee. When we go in and ask some of the institutions to do loan modifications on entire packages, those that fall out and they cannot do the loan modifications on that work very well, we will provide the loan guarantees for them to do so. 
   So for anybody who says there is nothing in this for homeowners, they are incorrect. Read the bill. The facts are there. This is the strongest part of this legislation, protecting homeowners and doing the kind of loan modifications that will keep people in their homes who have these adjustable rate mortgages even before they reset.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman and Members, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. And I would like to thank my colleague from Mississippi, Mr. GENE TAYLOR, for all of the work that he has put into this issue and the way that he helped to focus my committee and the overall Financial Services Committee on this very issue. 
   He will be speaking today. And I don't think there is anybody who can describe what happened as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and  Wilma and what happened in the gulf coast, in particular, his district, any better than Mr. Taylor will do. And by the time he finishes his presentation here today, I think all of the Members will very well understand why it is so necessary that we move with a real reform bill to deal with these kinds of catastrophes. 
   As you know, I introduced a bill on July 19, 2007, following substantial consideration by the Financial Services Committee on flood insurance and related issues. Specifically, the committee held two hearings on June 12, one examining the issues of the national flood insurance program raised by the gulf coast hurricanes, and a second hearing on the predecessor to this bill, H.R. 1682, introduced by Chairman Frank. Thereafter, on July 17, the committee held a hearing on related legislation, H.R. 920, the Multiple Peril Insurance Act of 2007, that was introduced by Mr. Taylor. 
   H.R. 3121 reflects this extensive committee analysis on the NFIP, wind insurance and related issues. Accordingly, on July 26, 2007, the Financial Services Committee reported out H.R. 3121 with a favorable recommendation. I hope that we're able to pass H.R. 3121 today because it makes critical improvements to the NFIP in light of the devastating lessons of the 2005 hurricane season. 
   In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, NFIP faced unprecedented financial and regulatory strains as it confronted approximately $21.9 billion in NFIP-insured losses. The program had to borrow in excess of $17.5 billion from the United States Treasury in order to pay claims and interest resulting from Hurricane Katrina alone. 
   Those of us concerned about NFIP in the wake of the 2005 storms saw the urgent need to put the program on sounder financial footing by addressing the issues stakeholders had raised around the substantial premium discounts and cross-subsidies among classes of its policyholders, outdated flood insurance rate maps, allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements, and questions as to the performance and efficiency of private insurers operating under the NFIP's Write Your Own program. 
   Additionally, the committee hearing on H.R. 920, the Multiple Peril Insurance Act of 2007, made it clear the need to address perverse incentives created by dual government and private insurance regimes when damage can be a result of wind and flood. I'm proud to say that H.R. 3121 prudently addresses these concerns. 
   Specifically, the bill would increase NFIP's borrowing authority to $21.5 billion from $20.8 billion, but require that it satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by phasing out discounted premiums; allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that is, FEMA, to increase flood policy rates by 15 percent a year, up from 10 percent; raise civil penalties on federally regulated lenders who fail to enforce mandatory purchase of flood insurance for mortgage holders; increase program participation incentives; encourage the revisions to flood maps; and starting in mid-2008, allow for the purchase of optional insurance for wind as well as water damage. 
   These reforms are desperately needed because, as we have seen, storms will become stronger and more intense. We need a program that can contend with the worst that Mother Nature can throw at us. Simply put, we cannot wait and let another hurricane season pass without putting the National Flood Insurance Program on solid footing. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. 
   And I thank you so very much, Mr. Chairman, for all of the time that you have put in trying to make us very credible as we relate to these reforms by not only giving us the leadership, but allowing us to hold the hearings that are so necessary to get the information that is so desperately needed to do this.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. First, I would like to thank BARNEY FRANK for his extraordinary work, accepting the impossible task of making sense of the economic crisis we are facing. 
   Madam Speaker, $700 billion is a lot of money. Bailout for Wall Street? I don't think so. I could care less about Wall Street and the high-priced schemers and their tricky products: hedge funds, short selling, and insider trading. I care about Main Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. 
   I am voting ``yes'' on this bill because this $700 billion will purchase the nonperforming loans, the bad debt, and the toxic paper which, if left to the market, could cause the greatest financial crisis our country has ever seen. These nonperforming loans represent people, real Americans in trouble. Yes, some got in over their heads. They contracted for mortgages they could not afford. But many Americans are the victims of predatory lending, suckered into adjustable rate mortgages that lured them with a low interest rate, no down payment, or no documentation loans that adjusted or reset within 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. Homeowners were not always told the truth. Upon reset, homeowners were then faced with mortgages that doubled, tripled, or quadrupled with the new interest rates and the margins that were added to the existing interest rates. 
   There's enough blame to go around. Greed, a regulatory system that turned a blind eye to these exotic schemes and products, brokers and banks who peddled these products, and investment banks who invested in these products all share some of the blame. We must correct the problems caused by these loans. We must modify these loans and stop the foreclosures and help American families keep their homes. We must reform our Federal regulatory agencies and never allow this subprime exploitation to occur again. 
   Today we have financial institutions that will fail if we do not act. Credit will dry up for home mortgages, auto purchases, student loans, and small businesses. More jobs will be lost and the economy will crash. 
   I would have preferred to have a strong bankruptcy provision in this bill, giving Americans a real option to work themselves out of debt. I would have also liked to have seen a provision  providing a substantial fee to Wall Street firms that participate in this program. But, unfortunately, there was not the support or political will to get these things done. 
   I have worked on this bill to strengthen the ability for the servicers who collect those mortgage payments and fees to modify these loans. I have worked to assist small regional and minority banks. I have included language to open up the ability for women and minorities to participate in asset management and all the other business opportunities, including opportunities for the newspapers, ad agencies, consulting firms, real estate professionals, legal services, financial managers, and information systems consulting services that will be created as we use these funds to clean up this mess.

   Finally, I cannot take the chance that people who have worked all of their lives to save for their retirement will lose their pension funds and 401(k) savings nor can I take the chance that the stock market will be weakened and Americans will lose their investments. There will be many who will say ``I don't believe the average person will be hurt if we do not act.'' I refuse to take that chance. Today we do what we truly believe must be done. But believe me, we must and we will tighten the screws on Wall Street. This bill will support the idea that we must get rid of these outrageous compensation packages for CEOs and executives. We must prosecute those who violate the law and ignore their responsibilities. 
   Today I vote ``yes,'' but there is much more to be done. We must never again allow the risk to our economy that's been created by greed to ever occur again.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, this evening I come to the floor to be with my friend and colleague Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY as she gives her 250th speech and Special Order on this floor. I come to be with her to commend her for the tremendous leadership that she has provided not only in speaking out against the war in Iraq, but because she has given numerous press conferences, she has been on numerous speaking engagements, she has spoken with editorial boards, she has written articles, she has done everything that could be done in order to provide leadership and to encourage and urge the Congress of the United States to bring our soldiers home. 
   Unfortunately, her messages have not always been heard. But there are those of us, those of us who work with her in the Progressive Caucus, those of us who work with her in the Out of Iraq Caucus, who have tried to not only give support but to do the same kinds of things that she has been doing in order to end this war. 
   The American people are tired of this war, and I find it disingenuous for some of the pundits to say that somehow this is off the radar screen, that this is not an issue that the American public cares about anymore, that somehow it is the economy. Of course it is the economy, but you cannot separate what is going on within our economy from the war. We must look at this war for what it is. 
   First of all, it is a war that we certainly should not be in. We were misled. There were never any weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein is dead. Four thousand of our American soldiers have been killed in this war. Countless Iraqis, Iraqi civilians, and others who have made up the coalition forces from other countries are also dead. And so here we are, and the pundits are talking about it is not about the war, it's not on the radar screen of the American public, that the economy is, when, in fact, our economy is in recession because of this mismanaged war. 
   We have a President of the United States who came in as a fiscal conservative supposedly belonging to the party of the fiscal conservatives who have been spending, spending, spending on this war in Iraq, over $500 billion on this war in Iraq, at the same time giving tax cuts to the richest 1 percent of the corporations of America and denying the dollars that we need to invest in our own domestic problems that need to be addressed. 
   We had a bridge fall down in Minneapolis, and people wondered why did that happen. And when we took a close look at the reviews, the assessments that had been done about the state of affairs of our bridges and our infrastructure, we learned that many of our bridges in America are in the same position that that bridge was in, and we know that they have been assessed to be dangerous, that they need repair. 
   Why don't we have the money to invest in our infrastructure? Why is it we cannot create the jobs by investing in our infrastructure? Why can't we repair the bridges and the roads and the highways and build credible transportation systems? It is because this administration has decided that we are going to spend a disproportionate amount of the taxpayers' dollars on this war in Iraq, and we don't know when we are going to get out of this war in Iraq. And this administration would have us believe, because they have sent more soldiers and spent more money in the so-called surge, that somehow we are winning the war. What are we winning? What does winning look like? I don't recognize it. 
   I know this: I know that these 4,000 soldiers that have been killed in Iraq are not with their families, that their families, many, are in disarray; many of them very patriotic, who went to war because the President said that they were needed; and many of them who are no longer with us, their families are suffering. And we have others who have been injured who have come home, and they have not gotten the best medical treatment that they should have received, even though they were promised that, if they serve, they would be taken care of. 
   So here we are. We have destabilized the Middle East and we have occupied Iraq. We have Iran that is threatening us, Syria, Lebanon destabilized, and Pakistan is a joke. 
   I will simply conclude by thanking Lynn Woolsey for all that she has done to try to convince this Congress we should bring our soldiers home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME NOW -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday I participated in a rally and march here in Washington, DC, on the Mall, organized by United for Peace and Justice. United for Peace and Justice is a coalition of over 1,300 groups from all over this country. 
   Citizens came from near and far. They came by car and bus and train and plane to urge this President and this Congress to end the war in Iraq. They were young. They were old. They were rich. They were poor. They were  every age, every ethnic group, all religions, all with one message: Bring our troops home now. 
   There were six Members of Congress who were present there, and we thanked all of the people who attended for caring enough to come to Washington, DC, to spend their money to urge their government to end this war. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, this was democracy at work. It was a beautiful day. People were in high spirits. We walked. We sang. We chanted. And we literally said we love this country, we love our soldiers, and we want the best for our people. 
   We were joined by many veterans. There were several veterans groups there. But the most moving and touching part of this march was the mothers who marched with us, and they had signs. Some of them had signs of their sons who had been killed in Iraq. Some of them brought the message that they had paid a huge sacrifice and they did not wish Americans to continue paying this high price for a war that we should not be in. 
   This is a war that it is easy to be against, because we were led into this war under false pretenses. There are no weapons of mass destruction. We have been told that we would be greeted with open arms. We were told that we would be seen as the liberators. None of that was true. We are occupiers, and they want us out of Iraq. It is not simply that the Sunnis want us out of Iraq. It is not simply that the Shiites want us out or the Kurds want us out. They all want us out of Iraq. 
   This was a wonderful weekend because not only did we march and we rallied, but the marchers came to Capitol Hill and they lobbied their legislators. They knocked on their doors. They came from all these towns and hamlets and cities all over America to talk with their legislators. This truly was democracy at work. 
   And today we filled 1100 Longworth, the Ways and Means room, where we had a forum with 11 book authors who have written about the war in Iraq, what is wrong with it and why we should get out, and did we have a discussion. It was one of the most beautiful discussions with highly intelligent authors who have done research, who have put a lot of work into producing these books. And they shared with us in a very profound way what they knew and why they had decided to take a part of their lives to stop and write about what is wrong with our being in Iraq. 
   So this was a wonderful weekend. This has been a wonderful time. I keep saying this is democracy at work because this is what the Constitution is all about. It is about participation of the citizens. 
   The citizens of this country are sick and tired of this war. I don't know why the Members of Congress are allowing the citizens to get way ahead of them. They elect us to come and represent them. They think that we have the resources to know what is going on. We give a lot of money to our intelligence agencies. We should be able to tell the people what is wrong and what is going on in Iraq. But, instead, they are ahead of us; and they are urging us to stop this war. 
   But, in the final analysis, they know everything about what we are doing. It is not enough to talk the talk. You have got to walk the walk. They know the difference between nuancing and posturing, and they want action. 
   And they know that we are about to have a resolution over in this House that will disagree with the surge, the escalation that is being advocated by this President. But they also understand that we can't stop that, that the President has already started to resend soldiers. These are not new boots on the ground. These are soldiers that have done their tours, that have been sent back a second and third time, and they say that is not enough. 
   They will know whether or not we mean business if we are prepared to stop funding this war.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1852, the Expanded American Homeownership Act of 2007. As you know, I introduced H.R. 1852 on March 29, 2007, and I want to take this time to thank Chairman Frank for his original cosponsorship. I also want to acknowledge each of my colleagues both on the Committee on Financial Services and in the House who have joined with me to see that this important legislation passes the House. 
   It has been a little over 4 months since the Committee on Financial Services considered this measure to revitalize the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA. On May 3, 2007, the  Expanding American Homeownership Act passed the Committee on Financial Services by a vote of 45-19. 
   The ensuing period has only made the need to enact H.R. 1852 clearer. We are all aware of the turmoil in the mortgage markets with the dramatic rise in foreclosures. Some predict as many as 2 million mortgage loan defaults by year's end. Equally troubling is the widening impact that the mortgage crisis is having within the domestic and global economy. We still don't know the full scope of that impact, but it is clear that we must take prudent steps to address the underlying issues in the housing markets. 
   H.R. 1852 is a necessary step in that direction. To be clear, this legislation will not by itself resolve the crisis. Indeed, later this week the Committee on Financial Services will hold a hearing to discuss the major players in government and the markets' other strategies to address this multi-faceted problem. 
   Revitalizing FHA, however, is an essential element of a comprehensive strategy. FHA is a federally insured loan program that for over 60 years has been a reliable source of affordable fixed-rate mortgage loans, especially for first-time home buyers. 
   At the end of funding year 2006, FHA had $338.6 billion of insurance in force on about 3.9 million loans. From 1934 through the end of funding year 2006, FHA had insured about $33.9 million home loans at a mortgage volume of about $1.9 trillion. 
   Once the preeminent provider of mortgage insurance to low- and moderate-income home buyers, FHA has seen a precipitous drop in its market share in recent years. In 1991, FHA loans accounted for about 11 percent of the market. By 2004, that share had dropped to about 3 percent. 
   Borrowers have increasingly turned to the private subprime market for loans, many of which contained adjustable rates that are now resetting, or will do so in the near future. In the absence of significant appreciation in the values of their homes, many of these borrowers will be unable to refinance to ensure affordable monthly payments into the future. 
   H.R. 1852 will enable FHA to serve more subprime borrowers at affordable rates and terms, recapture borrowers that have turned to problematic subprime loans in recent years, and offer refinancing loan opportunities to borrowers struggling to meet their mortgage payments in the midst of the current home price and mortgage market turbulence. 
   Specifically, this bill would authorize zero and lower down payment loans for borrowers that can afford mortgage payments but lack the cash for required down payment, a major reason that many low-income borrowers turn to private subprime markets rather than FHA-insured loans. It will increase loan limits to make FHA relevant in high-cost markets, direct FHA to provide mortgage loans to high-risk, but qualified, buyers; it will enhance the FHA reverse mortgage loan program, promote the sale of foreclosed FHA rental housing, loans to localities so that affordable housing can be maintained in local communities, authorize up to $300 million a year for the next 5 fiscal years from the bill's excess profits for an affordable housing fund instead of returning such funds to the general treasury. 
   Notably, H.R. 1852 also includes a number of important changes to the FHA bill that passed the House last year. First, it eliminates the fee increases from last year's bill for borrowers that continue to make a down payment, scaling back the maximum upfront fee from 3 percent to 2.5, and the maximum annual fee from 2 percent to .55 percent. 
   These reductions would reduce FHA closing costs premiums for a hypothetical family buying a $300,000 home by $2,250, and annual fees over a 5-year period by over $20,000 compared to last year's bill. 
   This bill also includes a provision authorizing loan limit increases for FHA rental housing loans in high-cost areas where current FHA loans do not keep pace with local construction costs. In this way we are ensuring that FHA contributes to the full range of affordable housing stock we so desperately need in this country, from homeownership to rental housing. 
   In that vein, H.R. 1852 also differs from H.R. 1752 in a final, absolutely critical respect. This bill recognizes the full scope of the affordable housing crisis facing the Nation by targeting up to $300 million annually for the next 5 years to an affordable housing fund for grants to provide affordable rental housing and homeownership opportunities for low-income families. 
   This measure is clearly needed. We can thank Barney Frank for all of the work and all of the attention and time that he put into making sure that this was a part of this bill. Simply put, this country faces an affordable housing crisis of epic proportions. According to Harvard University's State of the Nation's Housing in 2007 report, 17 million renters and homeowners are paying more than half their incomes in housing costs. There just isn't enough affordable housing stock to go around. 
   With that, and in closing, I have said for many years that there is an affordable housing crisis in America. In recent months that crisis has exploded beyond the poorest renters and homeowners, to threaten the domestic economy. H.R. 1852 is a necessary step, though not in itself a sufficient one, in walking us back from the brink and the direction of meeting the housing needs of all Americans. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to make sure that my colleague on the opposite side of the aisle, Mrs. Biggert, whom I've worked with so closely and enjoy working with so much, is clear on the fact that the housing trust fund does not take money from FHA. And I think Mr. Frank made it very clear before he left that HUD would have to certify that it is solvent before any of that money goes into the trust fund. I think that's very important. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa).

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman and Members of the House, first I would like to tell the subcommittee ranking member how sad I am that we're not going to be working as closely together on this Subcommittee on Housing. I have truly enjoyed working with her. And even though she will remain on the committee, we perhaps won't have an opportunity to sit together and chat and not only make decisions, but just make fun of some people from time to time.

   Ms. WATERS. I would also like to thank Mr. Bachus and Mr. Miller; Mr. Bachus, who has been so good to work with; Mr. Miller, who is an expert. We have been able to talk about things, to work out differences, and to move forward. 
   This is a very productive overall Financial Services Committee, a very productive Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development. With people working together on both sides of the aisle, we're getting things done. 
   This may be one of the most important pieces of legislation to pass this House in this session. We will be able to help people with refinancing. We will be able to help people stay out of foreclosure. We will be able to revitalize FHA, that really knows and understands how to provide insurance for moderate- and low-income folks who are desperate to be homeowners. And I am just delighted that I've had an opportunity to play a role. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. I appreciate Mr. Cardoza's amendment so much because it does have an important impact on high-cost markets like our home State of California. The FHA statute creates an artificial cap on the maximum home price, meaning that FHA does almost no loan business in certain high-cost markets. Now, this will put FHA back in the business of insuring loans in high-cost areas, not only in California, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other areas with a limited FHA presence. This amendment also puts FHA in a better position to help subprime borrowers and address temporary dislocations. 
   Even before the recent mortgage crisis developed, there was a bipartisan consensus shared by the administration that reformed H.R. 1852 would help get FHA back in the business of making loans at good terms and conditions to borrowers that turned to predatory loans in recent years. This amendment expands the extent to which this objective can be achieved. This is absolutely a great amendment, and I support it.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I hope that our chairman didn't confuse you with that convoluted definition of what the time is that we are claiming. 
   Madam Chairman, I am in strong support of this amendment. As a matter of fact, I would like to take this moment to commend and thank my colleague, Mr. Miller, for the work that he has done in helping other Members to understand what this is all about. 
   I can recall when we had the hearing and everybody said, well, this is such a wonderful idea. As a matter of fact, all of us voted for the American Dream Down Payment Act on both sides of the aisle. We can't understand why there would be any questions or any problems about the way that there is assistance being given to would-be homeowners by organizations such as the ones who were presented to us on that day of the hearing. So because of his expertise and his understanding and his appreciation, he has helped us all to come together, and it has support on both sides of the aisle. 
   As was mentioned, the amendment would allow qualified down payment assistance providers to participate in an FHA program if certain conditions are satisfied, that is, no obligation for the mortgagor to repay and net worth requirement. 
   The Secretary shall consider as cash or its equivalent any amounts gifted by a family member, the mortgagor's employer or labor union, or a qualified homeownership assistance entity, but only if there is no obligation on the part of the mortgagor to repay the gift. 
   I rise in support of this amendment. It is a major step in the direction of capturing the benefits of down payment assistance programs to over 1 million households since 1999, many of them FHA-insured borrowers, while safeguarding against bad actors in the field. The minimum capitalization requirement will protect borrowers from fly-by-night operations, which the explicit prohibition against requiring repayment of such assistance by the borrower will ensure that the benefit is indeed a gift. 
   Equally important, the additional measures to ensure the legitimacy of  appraisals in FHA-insured transactions contained in H.R. 1852 and the manager's amendment to the bill will help safeguard the entire progress. Inflated appraisals undercut the legitimacy of seller-financed down payment assistance. 
   Down payment assistance that is repaid from a seller's proceeds that derive from a borrower's ability to get a loan based on an inflated appraisal is no gift at all to the borrower. H.R. 1852 cracks down on such schemes, while preserving the field for legitimate down payment programs. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman and Members, earlier today we talked about how we worked together so well in order to get the best possible legislation. And I am just a little bit sad that this substitute amendment would reform for the Federal Housing Administration's FHA single-family mortgage insurance activities and would allow FHA to base each borrower's mortgage insurance premiums on the risk that the borrower poses to the FHA mortgage insurance fund with slight variations. 
   Under this proposal, mortgage insurance premiums will be based on the borrower's credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and on FHA's historical experience with similar borrowers. 
   This amendment maintains FHA reserves within the insurance fund to preserve the future solvency of the FHA program. I just rise in strong opposition to this amendment for the simple reason that H.R. 1852 is a better bill than the FHA reform bill that passed the House last year. And I could go on and on and on talking about why this is a much better bill, but I think this would be a step backwards, and I would ask my colleagues not to support this amendment. It is not a good amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (JENA SIX -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to see that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has tossed out the conviction of aggravated battery for 17-year-old Mychal Bell. I can no longer be silent about the ongoing struggle for justice for the six high school students in Jena, Louisiana, known as the Jena Six. These young boys, who were arrested after a racially charged school fight and charged with attempted murder following a noose hanging incident now face the prospect of losing much of their young lives to a tainted criminal justice system. 
   I have carefully reviewed all of the news accounts of the events surrounding this most troubling case. I have talked with the parents, and I have talked with the attorneys. I remain convinced that this case is a result of long-standing, deep-seated racial divisions in Jena, Louisiana. 
   It seems unreasonable that on a school campus the administration was unaware of the fact that white students had claimed the space under a tree and declared it off limits to black students. Even so, once the black students asked permission of the administration to sit under the tree and were granted permission to sit under the tree, the school should have recognized that a problem was brewing. The school should have initiated discussions surrounding the residual racial issues that existed in order to avoid a confrontation. 
   After the black students sat under the tree, it is reported that the white students responded by hanging three hangman's nooses in a tree. Given this country's history of racially motivated  violence, specifically lynchings, the black students were offended and threatened by the physical and emotional message sent by the nooses hanging in the tree. It seems unconscionable that this kind of Jim Crow era segregation, exclusion and emotional terrorism could be tolerated today. 
   There was tension on the campus and several fights took place. In one fight, a black student was beaten and the white student responsible was suspended. In another fight, a white student was beaten and the black students allegedly responsible were arrested and charged first with attempted murder and later charged with aggravated battery. These are serious criminal charges. 
   Let me be clear. I do not condone physical violence. I believe all of the students involved in the alleged fighting incidents should be held accountable by school officials. But school-age children all over this country get in fights every day and are appropriately disciplined by school administrators, whether it is a suspension or some other administrative punishment. Appropriate action is taken, and rarely do these incidents rise to the level of a criminal act. However, regardless of the charges and the unusually harsh approach that was taken by the district attorney, one young man, Mychal Bell, who is now still in jail, should never have been tried as an adult for this incident. That is why the Third Circuit Court of Appeals just ruled that that conviction must be tossed out and the other students should never have been incarcerated for the better part of a year awaiting their fate. This injustice cannot be swept under the rug and pacified simply by moving the case from the adult court. 
   The work here is not done. Along with Mychal Bell, there are five other students, Robert Bailey, Carwin Jones, Theodore Shaw, Jesse Beard and Bryant Ray Purvis, whose lives have been placed on hold awaiting their day in court. 
   I call on the district attorney to drop all charges against the Jena Six. The City of Jena must begin a reconciliation process which begins with the apology by and investigation of District Attorney Reed Walters for breach of ethics, false imprisonment and civil rights violations. His comments and actions have been both rogue and irresponsible and clearly demonstrate an agenda that is not in line with peace, justice or fairness. 
   Young people are traveling to Jena on Thursday led by Howard University students. They are coming from all over America to go to Jena, Louisiana to show support. These cases stand as the greatest civil rights challenges this Nation has faced in the 21st century. I will be traveling with them. I will be in Jena with the students. This is a new chapter in the civil rights movement led by young people to get America to do the right thing and to bring justice to Jena.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am compelled to come to the floor this evening to talk about the war in Iraq one more time. I know that this is the focus of this Congress, whether we want it to be or not. No matter what we do or what we try to do, we are met head-on with the fact of the matter that Iraq stands before us as an issue, as something that must be solved. 
   The fact of the matter is we have now over 3,600 soldiers who have been killed in Iraq. Over 27,000 soldiers have been seriously injured; wounded. I am talking about the kinds of injuries such as brain injuries, loss of limbs, eyes gouged out, the kind of injuries that certainly will interfere with these soldiers' ability to have a good quality of life, to be able to be employed, to  pursue the kinds of careers that many of them perhaps dreamed of because, unfortunately, they have found themselves in this war in Iraq. 
   Many of these soldiers are very patriotic. When their President told them that we were in danger, that we were at risk, that somehow Saddam Hussein was responsible for weapons of mass destruction and 9/11, they eagerly and gladly signed up to go to war to defend their country, only to learn that there were no weapons of mass destruction. 
   We say this over and over again. But the American people and we all must be reminded that many folks supported the President. Many of the Members of Congress supported the President because they believed the President. They believed him when he said that he had to wage this war on terrorism because we were at risk and Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11. 
   So here we are. No weapons of mass destruction. We have destabilized Iraq. There is a civil war that is going on. Many of us were in denial about the civil war even though we watched it developing. We watched the Sunnis and the Shias and the Kurds begin to turn on each other and to fight each other. We watched the militias grow. We watched as this country has simply been torn apart. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, we are now at a point in time where the American people are sick and tired of this war. The polls show it. They are not happy, certainly, with the President of the United States. But they are even less happy with the Congress of the United States. 
   I am a Democrat. The people of my party thought they voted for us to come here in November and end this war. While many of us would like very much to end the war, we still have some Members who are not so sure. They don't quite have the courage yet. They don't want to be thought of as unpatriotic. They don't want to be thought of as pulling the rug out from under the soldiers. But the American people will not tolerate this war much longer. They have said so in so many ways. 
   I am just hopeful, I am just hopeful that we will gather the courage that is needed and step up to the plate and let this President know there will be no more dollars, no more dollars appropriated by this Congress to continue this war in Iraq. 
   Now, I know a lot of people, and a lot of Members of this House don't want to go there yet. They are trying to say everything that they can possibly say in so many ways to let the President know that we should get out, that there should be a time certain. But they are not yet ready to talk about defunding this war. 
   Well, I stand here proudly this evening as one person, one Member of Congress, elected by the people of the 35th Congressional District. I am prepared to defund this war. I do not think we should spend another dime on this war that has destabilized Iraq. We have those who talk about the fact that, and the President of the United States has said, we must stay there until we train the soldiers in Iraq to provide the security for Iraq. That is laughable. Not only have we misled the people about the numbers that we were training in Iraq, the soldiers, many of whom that we have trained, have turned on our soldiers, have undermined them at the point of contact and confrontation. So I simply say this evening, we have to get out of this war.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3074, the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. 
   The distinguished chairman, Mr. Obey, and Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Mr. Olver, had to make many difficult decisions in drafting this bill, and I am pleased that most of our vital housing programs see increases over the President's budget request for funding year 2008. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, I believe this bill will preserve many of the housing programs we have fought for over the years. 
   On July 12, the House passed H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. A central purpose of H.R. 1851 is to provide reliable, adequate funding for the Nation's largest subsidized housing program, buffeted in recent fiscal years. 
   In light of this, I am troubled that the President once again grossly underfunded section 8 in his budget request, asking for a mere $8 million above last year's funding level for the renewal of section 8 housing vouchers, an amount that won't even cover the cost of inflation. I commend Chairman Olver for rejecting this abysmal funding level and putting the dollars needed back into the section 8 program. 
   I also urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act and to pass the companion bill so that we can make needed reforms and bring stability and security to this critical program. 
   I am honored to be an original cosponsor of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, H.R. 2895, which will provide for the preservation and construction of 1.5 million units of affordable housing over the next 10 years. Because preservation begins with funding the units we have now, I am pleased that the bill increases the funding for project-based rental assistance by $667 million over the President's request; however, I am dismayed at the news that the Department has not paid some project-based owners for the month of July. It isn't enough for us to appropriate the dollars; HUD has to get them out of the door. I urge the Department to make these payments on time so that we do not risk losing owners of precious affordable housing units. 
   For too many years, the Nation's public housing program has been grossly underfunded. In 2007, PHAs will only receive between 82 cents and 85 cents for every dollar it costs to run public housing, impacting their ability to repair and maintain public housing units. By increasing funding for public housing programs to levels above the President's request, this bill maintains our investment in public housing. I am also pleased that the committee has rejected the administration's attempt not only to kill the HOPE VI program, but to take back prior-year funds appropriated by this House. The HOPE VI program needs to be updated, but it is a valuable program. That is why we'll soon introduce a bill to reauthorize and improve HOPE VI providing for, among other things, one-for-one replacement and the right of residents to return to a revitalized public housing unit. 
   Again, I want to applaud the committee for ensuring that the CDBG program is not severely underfunded. The CDBG program is funded at $3.396 billion, representing a $225 million increase compared to funding year 2006 funding level and $959 million above the President's funding year 2008 request. CDBG is vital to communities all over the country, providing valuable resources for almost every program imaginable from seniors programs to gang violence eradication programs. Without this increased level of funding, one of the Federal Government's only poverty fighting tools would have been stretched to the limit, leaving many communities desperate. 
   In addition, the bill provides funding for other key programs the administration sought to zero out, including the Brownfields, the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, and rural housing and economic development. The bill also maintains critical funding for the HOME program, Native American and Hawaiian housing grants, fair housing enforcement, and housing counseling.     
   Some of these important programs were scheduled to expire without reauthorization, but reauthorization without funding is the equivalent of killing a program. 
   Finally, the House today passed a resolution that I was pleased to cosponsor with Congressman Shays commemorating the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. While this is not a birthday for any of us we would prefer to be celebrating, these programs remain effective and desperately needed. Therefore, I am pleased that the bill funds the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grant at $1.561 billion, a full $234 million over funding year 2006.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (<em>RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE McKINNEY-VENTO HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT </em> -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 561, recognizing the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. I was pleased to join my Housing Subcommittee colleague Mr. SHAYS, and Congresswoman MCCOLLUM, in introducing this resolution to honor their late predecessors--Stewart McKinney of Connecticut and Bruce Vento of Minnesota--for their work across party lines to create the McKinney-Vento programs in response to the widespread homelessness that had reoccurred in the early 1980's for the first time since the Great Depression. 
   Since then, the McKinney-Vento Act programs have helped thousands of homeless men, women, and children return to stable housing and lives in which they can reach their full potential. I am pleased that we will take up for consideration today a FY 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which administers the majority of McKinney-Vento grants, that provides for $1.561 billion for the HUD homeless assistance account, a $234 million increase over FY 2006. 
   But as national homeless organizations noted poignantly at an event a few of us attended last week, this is truly a ``bittersweet'' anniversary. While this groundbreaking homeless legislation is a highlight of the legacy I inherit as the Chair of the Housing Subcommittee, the sad fact is that the McKinney-Vento Act programs should not still be so desperately needed on their 20th birthday. 
   In fact, because the McKinney-Vento Act was debated a few years before I entered Congress--though I had certainly addressed homeless issues during my tenure in the California state legislature--I had my staff provide me with some of the legislative history surrounding the bill. A couple of points are worth noting. 
   First, nobody ever thought that the McKinney-Vento Act was the answer to homelessness, despite its ambitious creation of 15 separate programs and authorization of over $400 million in funding. Indeed, the original House bill was entitled the ``Urgent Relief for the Homeless Act.'' 
   Of it, my distinguished predecessor as Chair of the then-Housing and Community Development Subcommittee, the late Henry Gonzalez, said, ``The emergency assistance provided in this bill will not eradicate the causes of homelessness; but rather is an emergency short-term effort to assist homeless persons.'' 
   In other words, the McKinney-Vento programs were always meant as a first step--a first step toward a social safety net in which no person is forced to live on the streets or in shelters because of poverty, whether or not that poverty is coupled with additional challenges like mental illness, drug addiction or HIV/AIDS. 
   What is also striking, however, is how much the people involved then knew or suspected, even in the midst of a new crisis, about the real long-term solutions to homelessness. Of necessity, perhaps, given the rapid and overwhelming growth in homelessness at the time, the majority of early McKinney-Vento Act authorizations and appropriations funded emergency food and shelter assistance. Yet, from the start, the McKinney-Vento Act invested in a wide range of interventions--including permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, education, mental health and substance addiction services, job training, and other interventions. 
   Building on this basic infrastructure, academic research coupled with the hard-earned knowledge of practitioners and government have moved us to a place where we know much more about who the homeless are, and what it takes to end homelessness for them than we did in 1987. 
   I am proud that the McKinney-Vento Act itself grew out of Housing Subcommittee hearings then-Chairman Gonzales convened starting 25 years ago, and, after Congress returns from its August recess, I intend to hold a series of four in-depth Subcommittee hearings to examine lessons learned in the intervening period in order to formulate better federal housing policy, starting with an updated McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. 
   But reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento Act, no matter how perfectly, is only a small piece of a real federal agenda to end homelessness. Another glaring theme emerges from the 1987 Congressional Record--the increasing lack of affordable housing and the Federal government's progressive disinvestment in housing production programs. 
   Well, the situation has only gotten worse. As you know, the 800,000 people who experience homelessness on any given night--over 10 percent of them in my home city of Los Angeles--are only the most visible feature of an affordable housing crisis that has reached epic proportions across the country. 
   As Housing Subcommittee Chair, my response is simple. It's time to get the Federal government back in the affordable housing production business. I am hoping we start with enactment of H.R. 1851, The Section 8 Voucher Improvement Act and H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Simply put, if the Federal government does not re-engage on affordable housing at this scale, and more, our successors will face the prospect of introducing a resolution to mark the 40th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Act in 2027. Let us hope we can render such a sad event unnecessary.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, Chairman Miller, and I rise in support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. 
   I am pleased that the Democratic leadership has taken a straightforward, no-holds-barred approach to expediting consideration of this legislation. And frankly, I am ashamed that it has taken so long to increase the minimum wage by so little. 
   What we do here today is a clear indication of the philosophical difference between Democrats and Republicans. My party, the Democratic Party, has tried to raise the minimum wage for nearly 10 years because we believe in live and let live. We believe that families should be fairly paid for their labor. We believe that wage earners, the true backbone of this Nation, should be able to put food on the table, roofs over their families' heads, clothes on their families' back and to have basic health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, $5.15 is totally unacceptable. No family can live on $5.15 an hour. Many wage earners are working two and three jobs, both husbands and wives and even their children, trying to make ends meet. Americans deserve better, and Americans expect their representatives to assist them in their quest for a decent quality of life. 
   Today the story will be written about the difference between those who stood up for the least of these and the those who came to this floor and continued to bring unconscionable arguments to deny low-income wage earners a mere $2.10 increase over their income in a 2-year period. 
   Many States could not wait for Congress to act, and they have undertaken to increase their wages. In my own State of California, the minimum wage effective January 1 of this year has increased to $7.25. 
   Mr. Speaker, 6.6 million people will benefit from raising the minimum wage. The economic gap between the rich and poor is growing. Too many people are living at or below the poverty line. When we pass this bill, we will all feel better about ourselves.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (ESCALATION OF TROOPS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I come to the floor of the House this evening in advance of the President's speech that is scheduled for, I think, 9 p.m. this evening, where the President is going to announce his new approach to dealing with the debacle that he has created in Iraq. He has coined it, ``New Way Forward.'' He has referred to it as a surge, but we all know what this is. This is an escalation. 
   The President of the United States is probably going to announce that the surge has already started. There are reports in the news already that about 90 advanced troops from the 82nd Airborne will arrive in Baghdad today, I believe. And so this so-called surge that the President has begun is one that is taking place without the support of the American people, without the support of many of the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. 
   Americans, and elected officials, in particular, are sick and tired of being misled, of not being told the truth, and trying to explain to our constituents what this war in Iraq is all about. Americans, basically, have come to the conclusion that this war has been mismanaged, that they have not been told the truth, that there were no weapons of destruction. 
   Oh, there were promises made. We were told by Mr. Rumsfeld that we would be welcomed with open arms; we would be seen as the liberators. The Iraqis see us as occupiers, and they want us out of their country. 
   We were told that we didn't have to worry about the cost of this war because there would be profits from the oil in Iraq that would not only help pay for the war but it would help to reconstruct the damage that has been done to Iraq by the occupation. 
   Oh, we were told not only would we have oil resources that would repay or pay for some of this damage, we were told that enough troops were going to be, Iraqi troops were going to be trained and that the numbers were growing and that they would soon be able to take over the security of Iraq. 
   None of that has happened. As a matter of fact, what we are finding is that our troops are being deserted in times of crisis and confrontation by Iraqi soldiers, that they are being undermined, oftentimes, by Iraqi soldiers, and that our troops don't know a Shiite from a Sunni from a Kurd. And they are very much so in harm's way because they really don't know what they are fighting, why they are fighting and why they are in Iraq. 
   But this President plans on sending about 24,000 U.S. troops to Iraq. Five brigades of U.S. troops, about 20,000 soldiers will be deployed to Baghdad to suppress sectarian violence. An additional 4,000 troops will be sent to the Anwar Province to pursue insurgents. 
   Responsibility for security, he says, in all of the country's provinces will be turned over to Iraqi forces by November 2007. Oh, haven't we heard those kinds of promises before. 
   How can we put any faith in the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, who first refused to send adequate numbers into the war? They were being told by their commanders and their generals that they needed more troops, but, no, Mr. Rumsfeld convinced, I suppose, this President that we didn't need it, and so we didn't send them. And now, at the 12th hour, we are talking about sending more troops. 
   It is too late. It is too late to have this escalation. We have lost. We have mismanaged. We have created an untenable situation, and there is a civil war going on in Iraq, and we can't manage it. We cannot undo the harm that we have created, and it does not make good sense to send our troops into harm's way. 
   Not only is our Commander-in-Chief sending more troops, the length of Army deployments will be increased from 12 months to 15 months. Marine deployment will be increased to 12 months from 7 months. In addition, the amount of time they spend at home to rest before returning to Iraq will be shortened. 
   Mr. President, mothers, fathers and families want their children and their relatives home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (CONCLUDING OUR INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, today Representative Woolsey, Representative Lee and I introduced a bill that would conclude our involvement in Iraq and bring our troops home. The bill, H.R. 508, is entitled, Bring Our Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq Restoration Act of 2007. The bill has 16 original cosponsors. Representative Woolsey was on the floor a moment ago, and she shared with you some of the provisions of that bill. 
   I will reiterate, I will repeat, if enacted, the bill would repeal the use-of-force authorization passed by Congress in 2002 and requires a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors hired by the U.S. Government within 6 months of the enactment of this bill. 
   The bill authorizes the President to support an international stabilization force in Iraq, if the Iraq government requests such a force, but U.S. troops would not be permitted to participate in the international force. 
   It would turn security activities and military operations in Iraq over to the elected Iraqi government within 6 months of the date of enactment. 
   It would prohibit the U.S. from establishing permanent bases in Iraq. 
   It would cap the number of officers and employees of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at 500. 
   It would accelerate the training and equipping of Iraq military and security forces, and pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy. 
   It would provide assistance to the Iraqi government in recovering cultural and historical artifacts that have disappeared since the U.S. invaded in 2003. 
   It will do a number of other things, but let me wrap this up by saying it would fully fund veterans' health care, including mental health care, for our returning veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am spending an inordinate amount of time on this issue, along with many of my other colleagues, and I have chosen to be a major cosponsor on this bill because I feel it is absolutely my responsibility to not only articulate what is wrong with this war, but to do everything that I can to encourage the President of the United States, the commander in chief, to bring our troops home. 
   I think it is important to do this because we have lost over 3,000 American soldiers. As a matter of fact, I think it is about 3,034. 
   I look at the continuing devastation in Iraq, and I see that just day before yesterday I believe over 100 Iraqis were killed and maybe twice as many was injured and we lost four more American soldiers.     
   This has got to stop. We are in control. We can stop this. I am encouraging our Commander-in-Chief to bring our troops home, and to pursue diplomacy, save lives. Because I believe if they continue down the path that they are going, we are going to have a real blood bath in a short period of time. 
   This surge, this expansion of the war that has been advocated and pursued and pushed by this President is absolutely the wrong thing to do. I know that he has been advised and he has accepted the advice that he is to go into Sadr City and he is to confront al-Sadr, who is the head of a tremendous militia. They have over 50,000 signed up in that militia and more coming each day. I don't want our American soldiers to confront that militia. I don't want our American soldiers in the middle of this civil war. I don't want these young boys who come from our cities and our towns and these young girls who come from our villages and our hamlets of America to be caught in between Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds. They don't know a Sunni from a Shiite. We don't speak the language. We haven't trained people. Even the soldiers that are supposed to be embedded doing the training can't speak the language. They are depending on interpreters. And let me tell you, even some of the soldiers that we are training in Iraq are turning their backs on us. They desert our soldiers in the middle of a conflict, in a confrontation. These are the ones that we are training, that we are depending on to take over the security of Iraq somehow. It is not going to happen. 
   We have to leave, and we should not be deterred from the mission of leaving because someone is going to accuse us of cutting and running. We know how these sound bites take place. We know what people do when they want to promote their position. They will mischaracterize what is being done. We have got to have the courage to stand up and stand up for our American soldiers. 
   I support and cosponsor this new bill. I would ask my colleagues to support it.  
   Today, Representative Woolsey, Representative Lee and I introduced a bill today that would conclude our involvement in Iraq and bring our troops home. 
   The bill, H.R. 508 is titled ``Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2007.'' 
   The bill has 16 original cosponsors. 
   If enacted, the bill would: 
   Repeals the use of force authorization passed by Congress in 2002. 
   Requires the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors hired by the U.S. government within 6 months of the enactment of this bill. The bill authorizes the President to support an international stabilization force in Iraq, if the Iraqi government requests such a force, but U.S. troops would not be permitted to participate in the international force; 
   Turn security activities and military operations in Iraq over to the elected Iraqi government within 6 months of the date of enactment. 
   Prohibit the U.S. from establishing permanent bases in Iraq; 
   Cap the number of officers and employees of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at 500; 
   Accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi military and security forces; 
   Pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy; 
   Provide Iraqi government assistance in destroying/cleaning up land mines, unexploded ordnance and depleted uranium shells; 
   Provide assistance to the Iraqi government in recovering cultural and historic artifacts that have disappeared since the U.S. invaded in 2003; 
   Provide compensation for Iraqi noncombatant civilian casualties--except for those individuals that participated in the armed insurgency after May 1, 2003; and 
   Fully fund veterans healthcare, including mental health care, for our returning veterans. 
   This bill stands in stark contrast to President Bush's proposal to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq. 
   The President proposes more of the same, while we provide a way to remove our troops from the sectarian civil war in Iraq, return our troops to their loved ones and begin the process of restoring our credibility throughout the world.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. Miller, for this time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act, a bill that will lower the interest rates that college students pay for subsidized loans from the current fixed rate of 6.8 percent to 3.5 percent over 5 years. 
   This is a fair bill that pays for itself by reducing the profit that the top lenders make from subsidizing loan debt, and it gives help to lower and middle income students who want to go to college but cannot afford it. 
   The Project on Student Debt states that over the past 10 years debt for graduating college seniors has increased by 108 percent. For graduates from public universities it has more than doubled, increasing by 116 percent. 
   This bill is needed because we want students to receive a college education without the stress of leaving with massive amounts of debt that will force them into jobs just for the sake of saving their credit. Furthermore, we do not want students to decide not to enter college because they are afraid of acquiring unmanageable debt. 
   According to Baum and O'Malley, in 2002, loan debt caused 14 percent to postpone marriage, 30 percent to postpone buying a car, 21 percent to wait on having children and 38 percent to wait on buying a house. 
   This bill chips away at the opportunity gap that keeps students of needy families and communities of color at the bottom of the ladder of success. Half of the students with Federal loans come from families with incomes between $26,000 and $68,000. The lower end of this range is close to the national poverty level for a family of four of $20,000. 
   Many parents who want to send their children to college have to take on large debt, rather than invest in homes or their retirement. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for the strong position you have taken on the floor today as you have presented this bill, and I would like to ask my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, if they had an opportunity to reduce the interest rate on their mortgage loans by 50 percent, on their automobile also by 50 percent, or any of their other debt, would they think it was such a terrible thing, as they think about this that we are doing today? 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (HONORING MUHAMMAD ALI ON HIS 65TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 58, honoring a good friend, Muhammad Ali, on the occasion of his 65th birthday and to extend best wishes to him and his family. The Gentlelady from Indiana [Ms. CARSON] is to be commended for bringing this resolution to the House in celebration of an icon of sportsmanship, fortitude, perseverance, and peace. 
   On November 20, 2005, I was honored to have given remarks during the grand opening of the Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville. This educational and cultural center was established to give visitors a glimpse of Ali's life and experiences and to help inspire them to pursue their dreams by applying their maximum potential. 
   Ali is many things to many people: a world champion, an Olympian, an innovator, a world-class father, husband, and friend. In his 21 years of boxing, he won 56 fights out of 61 and is the first boxer to win the heavyweight championship three times. He achieved the incredible feat of winning an Olympic gold medal in the 1960 games at the age of 18. 
   However, his legendary charisma, charm, and genius did not stop in the ring or at press conferences. What makes him a true pioneer is the fact that he was principled enough to say no to the Vietnam War. The words he spoke in refusing the draft made a stark social commentary during that time and taught America a valuable way of thinking. Those words taught us that war should always be a last resort and that before we over-commit ourselves elsewhere, we must fix the problems that exist right at home. This philosophy has tremendous relevance to us today in the context of the War in Iraq. Many Americans feel that we should re-align our priorities to address problems at home instead of fighting a war in Iraq. 
   I wish Muhammad Ali a very happy birthday. For his outstanding contributions to sports and sportsmanship and for the lessons on peace and conviction to principles that he gave the world, I sincerely thank him. His legacy and record of achievement have earned him the title of ``the Greatest of All Time.'' I support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, today I'm proud to join with a unified Democratic Caucus to cast my vote in support of H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act. This legislation marks the first time redeployment language has been attached to funding, and includes the strongest worded language to date, by stating Congress's explicit commitment to end the war in Iraq as safely and quickly as possible and bring our troops home. 
   The letter my colleagues Lynn Woolsey, Barbara Lee and I sent to President Bush stating that we would only support funding for the redeployment of our troops has grown from 70 to 92  signatories. As the letter stated, and as the title of this legislation echoes, we choose to support our military and look out for the best interests of this country by funding an orderly and responsible redeployment from Iraq. 
   While this bill is far from perfect, there's a lot in this bill to be proud of. This bill requires the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq within 30 days. It prohibits the deployment of U.S. troops not deemed fully trained, and it effectively bans the awful practice of waterboarding by any affiliate of a U.S. agency. I applaud the shared commitment of the Democratic Members in both the House and Senate to end the war in Iraq. 
   I share the public's dismay at the slow pace of Congress's action to end President Bush's failed war. It is, of course, the administration, not Congress, who ultimately deserves the blame for this terrible war. Before every major debate on the Iraq war, like clockwork, President Bush fires up the propaganda machine to twist reality and obscure the facts on the ground. 
   Those who stand in the way of real change in Iraq must be held accountable. They must not be allowed to quietly throw wrenches in the gears of change slowly rotating within this country. 
   A large and growing majority of Americans now believe it was a mistake to invade Iraq and that Congress should force a change in the President's irresponsible policies.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much. 
   I would like to join with the head of our delegation, Representative Stark, and others, in paying tribute to an extraordinary man.  
   Gus Hawkins was one of the most profound public policymakers that ever served in this House. You heard PETE STARK allude to some of that legislation. That legislation has been good for America, it's been good for African Americans, it's been good for this House. 
   I am so proud that when Gus Hawkins decided that he was not going to stand for reelection in 1990, he called me and he said, ``I'm calling you first because I believe that you would do well representing this district by serving as a Member of Congress.'' And so I have tried to live up to his legacy. 
   Gus Hawkins, however, was very, very strong. He understood how government works. He was understated. He got along with everybody. He made a lot of friends in this House. And people responded to him in a terrific manner. 
   And so I am standing here in great sympathy and in pain, because I know that we wanted to get him up here one more time when we focused on the Hawkins-Humphrey Act with BARNEY FRANK in the Financial Services Committee. We were not able to do that. And so all that we can do now is honor him with this tribute and say, ``Rest well, Gus.'' 
   I would request a moment of silence, please, before we resume our schedule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you so very much, Madam Speaker, and Chairman JOHN CONYERS.  
   A lot of people want to know what difference does it make that Democrats are now in the majority. This is a fine example. Chairman Conyers and others have been working on this issue for so very long. 
   And I rise in support of H.R. 1433, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, of which I am a proud cosponsor.  
   In a country where basic human and civil rights were only incrementally given to similarly situated citizens throughout its history, I applaud my colleagues for their courage and integrity to consider this measure and support its passage after 200 years of injustice. 
   I thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis) for their leadership and tenacity. Ms. Norton has consistently fought for the 16 years since she was first elected to Congress as my classmate in the 102nd Congress. 
   Just like securing the right to vote, or securing civil rights, for that matter, for African Americans, women and other minorities was a long fight with slow rewards, seeking the franchisement of D.C. citizens has been equally as difficult. 
   Just as it was shameful and unconscionable for African Americans and women to not have a vote until the passage of the 19th amendment, and of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, it is unconscionable for tax-paying citizens in America not to have a vote in Congress in the 21st century. 
   It is even more ironic that D.C. citizens have no vote in Congress when it operates right in their back yard. To discriminate against tax-paying citizens for over 200 years is an embarrassment to our democracy and undermines fundamental constitutional principles. 
   Nowhere in the United States Constitution is the word ``State'' defined, but some of our colleagues now wish to gerrymander a definition that would somehow distinguish citizens of D.C. from citizens of every other voting State. 
   Furthermore, not only does the guaranty clause, which reads that ``the United States shall guarantee a republican form of government,'' but the fifth amendment equal protection clause, which insures that all persons of the United States enjoy equal protection of the laws, make it clear that D.C. citizens should receive voting representation. 
   Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government. And the Supreme Court has defined a republican form of government as one constructed on the principle that the superior power resides in the body of the people. Are D.C. citizens not a part of the people? 
   Mr. Chairman, in this new Congress we hope to rid America of all traces of disenfranchisement, of impediments to voting. And giving D.C. residents a vote in the Congress is a major part of this goal. 
   I thank you, Congressman JOHN CONYERS, for your leadership.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, thank you for allocating the time for me to come and basically disagree with you on this floor, but that is what democracy is all about. 
   I don't believe that this bill will do what it is intended to do. I don't believe it makes good sense to say that our troops should be well trained and well equipped, and then give the President the right to waive that. 
   I don't believe that the President will report to us in any fashion that we can rely on in July, which will determine whether or not we get out by December or whether we continue to give assistance to the Iraqis. 
   I don't believe that it is enforceable, and I don't believe that this war will end by next August even though I think that is what the leadership intends for it to do. 
   This war has been mismanaged. We have been misled. We have been made to believe we would be welcomed with open arms. There were no weapons of mass destruction. That the troops were getting trained and success was right around the corner, and even last week when carnage was taking place in Iraq and our soldiers were being killed, this administration was out in the media talking about we were succeeding. And we will continue to be misled. This war has been mismanaged. 
   We don't have any friends in Iraq. The Sunnis do not want us there. The Shiites don't like the occupation, and the Kurds don't like us. We are undermined on a daily basis. 
   Even Mr. Maliki, who is supposed to be our ally, is working with Sadr over in Sadr City, who controls the militias. The police departments that are supposedly working to secure the people  are part of the undermining that is going on. Our soldiers, when they are in confrontations, are deserted by the very people that they are supposed to train. 
   General said this cannot be won militarily, it must be done diplomatically. I don't see the diplomatic effort. 
   I don't believe that giving $100 billion to the President of the United States to continue this war will achieve the goal that we intend for it to achieve. I oppose this legislation. I will continue to work with the Out of Iraq Caucus, and I am hopeful we can end this war and bring our soldiers home.

Mr. Speaker and Members, I wanted very much to be on this floor this evening with ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON first because I want to show my strong support for her, her work, her love for the District of Columbia and for the way she has used every bit of her time and efforts to fight for voting rights for Washington, DC. 
   I admire her spirit, I admire her commitment and I admire the way she has educated the entire Congress of the United States on this issue and forged a relationship with people on the other side of the aisle to get us to the point where we are. 
   I know that it is disappointing sometimes to feel you have come so close, and it still hasn't happened, but I am convinced it will happen, because of you, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. It will happen because you will not allow it not to happen. 
   So I wanted to be here this evening more than to simply talk about the unfairness of not having voting rights. We all know that. I wanted to be here tonight to say to you, sister, I am with you. I have marched, and I will march again. I have sat in, and I will sit in again. 
   I started on this issue when I was in the California State legislature, and sometimes I feel a little guilty because I don't think I demonstrated long enough and hard enough to show how much I care about this. 
   I come from a time and place in St. Louis, MO, where I was educated in an elementary school called the James Weldon Johnson elementary school, with strong teachers who taught us the Constitution. We learned the Declaration of Independence. We learned what happened with the British and about the Boston Tea Party, and we learned about Patrick Henry, who declared, ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' 
   So, whether or not it was intended, it was instilled in us that in this America, despite the fact that we had witnessed discrimination, we had been marginalized, that we have a right in this democracy to participate fully. 
   I really believed that, and if it was not intended, then they shouldn't have taught it to us, because we didn't think they were talking about somebody else. We truly believed they were talking about all of us. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is not a day that passes as I look around this Capitol that I am not reminded of the slaves that happened to build these marvelous buildings. I am reminded on a daily basis of the people who work right here in the Capitol, in these buildings, who live in the District of Columbia, who hear us wax eloquently day in and day out about democracy and participation and the Voting Rights Act. 
   These are the people who serve us day in and day out, and serve us well. You come into this Capitol late in the evening and you see who is working and how hard they work and what they do for all of us. And yet we walk past  them every day, and we don't stop to say, ``I'm so sorry. You should have the right to have the representation in the Congress of the United States that you deserve and we thought would have been guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.'' 
   So, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, thank you. Thank you for the love that you have for the District. I know that your constituents know this. You don't have to prove anything to anybody, because your daily work proves who you are and what your values are and what you care about. 
   I want you to know, November 7th gave us a new opportunity here. The people have voted, and the people have said to us they want to see change. The people are angry about what happened with Katrina. They are angry about Iraq. They are angry basically about injustice. And even those folks who oftentimes have been silent on the issue, they know injustice when they see it and feel it very deeply. 
   So I am hopeful that we will be able to use this time that we have to provide the leadership, to give you the support, to make sure we do justice by the District of Columbia and ensure that you get your voting rights.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, last night the President of the United States addressed the Nation. He had promised us that he was going to come up with creative solutions because he acknowledged his failures. He has designed what he called ``a new way forward.'' That is another one of his sound bites. 
   He tried to cloud the escalation by saying sending 20,000 new troops was a surge of some kind. There was nothing new or creative about his message. 
   Remember, it was the President of the United States who promised us that they were going to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction, only for us to find out there were no weapons of mass destruction. 
   Remember when he rolled out on the battleship saying ``Mission Accomplished''? 
   Remember when he promised us that we would get the proceeds from the oil in Iraq and that would be used to rehabilitate Iraq? 
   Remember when they promised us that we would be welcomed with open arms and we were winning the war? 
   Well, there this is no new real exit strategy. This is no new way forward. As a matter of fact, this is a new way backwards. And then on top of that, he had the audacity to tell us he wants a billion dollars to give to the Iraqis for jobs and employment. Give me some of that money for our cities and our rural communities. We could really use it. We have to oppose the President on this escalation.

   Mr. Speaker and Members, I am here on the floor this evening along with some of my other colleagues who have been working for almost 4 years to bring to the attention of this House the mistakes, the errors, the misdirection of the President of the United States as relates to the war in Iraq. We have Members on this floor this evening, many of my colleagues, who have not only spoken time and time again about what is going on in Iraq, but they have spoken in their districts and around the country, helping people to understand that there are some of us here in the Congress of the United States who do not support this war. 
   We support our troops. They are there because they have been told by the President of the United States that they should volunteer to serve because our country was at risk. But we have been trying to help people to understand what is happening, what is not happening. 
   Last night the President addressed the Nation with a new plan that he called a ``new way forward.'' Now, Mr. Speaker and Members, the President of the United States has come up with a lot of proposals since this debacle in Iraq. What he announced last night has been tried before, and he has failed at almost everything that he has attempted. 
   Now the President is talking about sending 21,000 troops to Iraq. Where are they going to come from? Whose family is going to have to make the sacrifice? Who are these young people who continue to volunteer and are told that they are going to be serving for a certain period of time only to be stopped from going home when they thought they would be going home? Under the President's plan, troops will have shorter amounts of time between deployments and longer deployments to Iraq. The length of Army deployments will be increased from 12 months to 15 months. Marine deployments will be increased to 12 months from 7 months. So where are these troops going to come from? 
   The President had announced that the Iraqi Government had committed to a series of benchmarks, including another 8,000 Iraqi troops and policemen in Baghdad. So what if they have committed to a series of benchmarks? So what if they don't meet them? Then what? What do we do? The President did not say if they fail on the first benchmark that we are going to get out of there.     
   No. He just simply one more time said to the American people: Trust me. And I don't think that many of us are willing to continue to trust that the President of the United States has a vision for where he is going with all of this. 
   The President also said that they were going to force passage of long delayed legislation to share all revenues among Iraq's sects and ethnic groups. Now, we have heard this oil story before. If you can recall, when the President first went into Iraq, they said they were going to get the revenues from the oil; it would help pay for the cost of the war, and it would pay for the reconstruction of Iraq after we have torn it up. And then, of course, the President asked that the American people support him in getting $10 billion for jobs and reconstruction in Iraq. 
   Well, now that the oil revenues are not forthcoming, this is a President who has spent, spent, spent, created a deficit. This is a President that refuses to support many of the domestic programs that many of us would like to see. We would like to see more affordable housing. We would like to see better schools. We would like to see comprehensive universal health care. But we cannot get the support of the President of the United States for these domestic needs. But he tells us, now that he has messed up, led us into war under false pretenses, that we are now to pay for it, and there is no oil revenue there to do it. Well, I think that my friends are going to join me in helping to unfold what has taken place. 
   At this time I would like to yield to the gentleman from Michigan.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 422, which calls on China to use its leverage with the government of Sudan to end the genocide in Darfur. 
   The ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan already is believed to have caused the deaths of almost half a million people. More than 200,000 people have been killed by Sudanese Government forces and armed militias since 2003, and another 200,000 people have died as a result of the deliberate destruction of homes, crops and water supplies and the resulting conditions of famine and disease. Over one-third of the population of Darfur has been displaced, and the United Nations estimated that almost 250,000 people have been displaced in the past 6 months alone, due primarily to government-sponsored militia attacks. 
   China, unlike most nations in the international community, has cultivated a close relationship with the Government of Sudan. China maintains close military ties with Sudan and purchased almost $2 billion worth of Sudanese oil last year. China also has cancelled $100 million in Sudanese debt and provided an additional $20 million to finance the construction of a presidential palace in the capital city. As a result, China is in a unique position to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to stop the violence in Darfur. So far, it has failed or refused to do so. 
   This resolution urges China to acknowledge and condemn the atrocities in Darfur, cease all weapons sales to Sudan, and suspend economic cooperation with Sudan. The resolution also urges China to use its leverage to influence the Government of Sudan to: comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions providing for disarmament of militias in Darfur and deployment of a full-scale peacekeeping force; participate in peace negotiations to secure a legitimate peace agreement between all parties; and improve working conditions for humanitarian organizations operating in Sudan and ensure they have access to the 2.5 million people displaced by this genocide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I urge China to join with the international community and take a stand against genocide in Darfur.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION HAS FAILED DISPLACED GULF COAST RESIDENTS -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise today to share with this body the unbelievable circumstances surrounding the victims of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.  
   I thought the American people had been shocked at the lack of response by our Government to the victims of these hurricanes. I thought the American people could hardly ever get over the fact that they witnessed victims of a natural disaster held up in a convention center in New Orleans for days without food, without wa ter, begging for help. 
   It was unbelievable when we discovered that the head of FEMA, Mr. Brown at the time, said that he did not know that those victims were out in front of the convention center waving white flags, inside the convention center sick and even dying. 
   It was unbelievable to witness one of the richest, if not the richest country in the world with the lack of adequate response to its citizens at a time when we were needed most. 
   And so we're trying to work through this. We have been w orking to try and get money to the gulf coast, to New Orleans, to Mississippi. We have tried to work to save public housing so that residents could return who had been evacuated and told that the housing would be rehabilitated and they could return. 
   Many of us have been pushing not only on FEMA and our government, but working with the State and local government trying to correct the injustices that we have now come to know that have taken place in the gulf coast. 
   And now we're confronted with anothe r unbelievable situation. How much bungling can you do? How much mismanagement can you be responsible for? 
   Finally, we find there's more. The Federal Emergency Management Administration, that is, FEMA, has admitted what people living in trailers have known for several years: that these trailers contain high levels of formaldehyde that pose serious health risks for residents. Almost after moving in, trailer residents started to complain about respiratory and other formaldehyde-related health problems. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, we've got to force FEMA to rise to the challenge of getting these 38,000 families out of these toxic trailers as soon as possible and move them into safe, permanent, and affordable housing. Unfortunately, because affordable housing creation has not been a priority of this Bush administration, I know this is going to be a difficult task. 
   The Bush administration has failed to ensure that the gulf coast r egion has an adequate supply of affordable housing for its displaced persons, including those in trailers. The administration approved redevelopment plans in Mississippi and Louisiana that provide less affordable housing than was available before Hurricane Katrina. It even allowed, believe this, the State of Mississippi to move $600 million away from housing assistance to the redevelopment of the Port of Gulfport. 
   Now, mind you, there are still people who are out of State who want to come home. There ar e still people living in trailers. There are still people doubled up with family members. And this administration, this Housing Secretary said to the State of Mississippi, go ahead and take $600 million from housing assistance and you can go ahead and use it for the redevelopment of the port. 
   In New Orleans, the administration has approved the demolition of 4,500 units of public housing, with no regard to the fact that there are 12,000 homeless persons who could have benefited from having a roof over th eir heads. The demolition of New Orleans' public housing during an affordable housing crisis is a prime example of this administration's shortsightedness and lack of concern for our country's lowest income renters. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I simply close by saying, here we are, FEMA again, mismanagement, lives at stake. They have no answers.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I am indeed honored to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 3521, the Pu blic Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007; and I want to thank Mr. Sires and Chairman Frank for their dedication and commitment to resolving this, at times, perplexing and confusing process known as asset management to which our public housing agencies have been struggling to adapt for several years now. This struggle has been made all the worse by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's overly prescriptive guidance on some issues, lack of guidance on other issues, and contra dictory or insufficient guidance on everything in between. 
   I think we can all agree that public housing agencies can be better at managing our public housing resources and that asset management has the potential to improve how public housing is managed nationwide. However, in examining the issues behind the implementation of asset management, it has become clear that HUD's one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work. In addition, the Department's willful disregard of existing statute as a part of the i mplementation is eroding the trust of housing agencies' residents and some Members of this Congress. 
   In light of the Department's actions and the need to proceed with asset management, my friend from New Jersey who introduced this bill, H.R. 3521, maintains and respects the negotiated rulemaking agreed to by all parties, housing agencies, their industry representatives and HUD and still requires housing agencies to convert to asset management by 2011. 
   However, the bill settles three outstanding issu es that have slowed the implementation of asset management: number one, the amount of management fees; number two, the ability of housing agencies to use a portion of their capital funds while operating expenses as allowed under statute; and number three, the kind of housing agencies that must convert to asset management. These are all critical issues that must be decided before 2011. 
   H.R. 3521 would require negotiated rulemaking to settle the issue of management fees. The fees that the Department is at tempting to impose on housing agencies are, in many cases, insufficient and will not meet the needs of housing agencies that have been historically underfunded. 
   In addition, these fees appear to have been arrived at in an arbitrary manner. Negotiated rulemaking on the subject of management fees would allow the Nation's housing managers to work with HUD to determine a reasonable fee for managing public housing. Because the date for full implementation of asset management would stay the same, negotiated r ulemaking would not delay or stall conversion to asset management. 
   On the use of capital funds for operating expenses, the statute is very clear. Housing agencies have the ability to move 20 percent of their capital funds to their operating fund. However, in its guidance, the Department has disregarded this plain-as-day statute and has limited capital fund fungibility to 10 percent. The bill simply asserts what is already in law. 
   Large housing agencies will benefit the most from asset management due to the economies of scale that will result from streamlining their operations. By raising the threshold for conversion from housing agencies that manage 250 units to those that manage 500 units, the bill simply ensures that only those housing agencies with the ability to benefit from asset management are required to comply with it. 
   Furthermore, the bill makes sure that asset management does not stifle tenant participation and resident organization. Public housing residents are very concerned about how asset management will impact their ability to participate and to organize. The bill ensures that the ability of residents to remain involved and to be represented is not impinged upon. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill does not undo, reverse, or undermine the original negotiated rulemaking between housing agencies and the Department. It simply settles four outstanding issues so that asset management can move forward.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise almost in disbelief that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, led by Mrs. Bachmann, would dare bring to this floor a motion that basically would say to us that the Federal Government cannot direct this issue on Federal property. 
   We own these public housing authorities. The people who are here live under the rules that we develop for living in public housing. We are confronted with the problem in America, and that problem is, unfortunately, and painfully, we have poor people who are isolated, and they find their power and their strength in the gun. 
   There are far too many guns raging every night in America in public housing authorities, whether it is Los Ange les or New York or down south. 
   What you find are young jobless men in gangs who shoot throughout the  night where people are ducking under their beds, afraid to open their doors. Many of these public housing authorities are on main thoroughfares, next to shopping centers, on your way to the airport. 
   These bullets don't limit themselves to inside these public housing authorities. They could end up shooting people who are passing through the area. 
   I understand, perhaps, the argument that one wo uld make about constitutional rights. While I disagree with that, I think it is foolhardy and foolish to talk about we don't have the authority to determine what happens on our property. 
   There are those in this room who would shout down public housing authorities and not give people a place to live at all, because they said there is too much violence, there is too much joblessness, there is too much violence. There are those of us who have worked for years not only to clean up these public housing author ities but to make sure that the people who live there are abiding by the law. 
   I am in disbelief that anyone could believe it's all right to continue what is happening in America today in many of these public housing authorities where young people are dying. Of course we don't like it. Of course we are appalled at it. We are pained with it. But give me a break. All of us are much more responsible than this motion to recommit would have us believe. 
   I would yield to the gentleman from Maryland.

   Ms. WATERS. I would first like to thank our chairman, Barney Frank, for the leadership that he has provided on dealing with a serious problem in America. I would like to thank the Members once more for the support that they gave me on the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that we passed today. That, coupled with what is being done now, will go a long way to providing real assistance to our cities, to our counties, to our States and to our citizens. 
   I know that it has been said over and over again today that people are suffering, that there are people who got into these loans that did not understand what a no-doc loan, a no interest rate loan was, an ARM that was going to reset within 6 months, 1 year or 2 years, and that the mortgage would double, triple or quadruple. 
   They are innocent, hardworking Americans out there every day who simply want to live the American Dream. Many of them were steered into these loans because there was this big, big housing bubble. 
   We had these local initiators of loans through our banks and our mortgage brokers who discovered that they could package them, they could securitize them, they would be invested in Wall Street, and the Wall Street people invested mightily in them, and now the services have them all. The only thing that the services can do is foreclose on these properties. 
   Well, we can do something about it. I don't know why we have to argue and fight about whether or not we can help the American people. They sent us here to look after their best interests. 
   I don't understand why anybody can call this a bailout when, in fact, nobody has said anything about the bailout of the almost $30 billion for Bear Stearns. If we can help Wall Street, we certainly can help the people who vote for us every day and who sent us here. 
   We help people all over this Nation in different ways. Some people are confronted with a hurricane, or a flood or an earthquake. American citizens expect us to be there for the citizens when we are needed in different ways. This is a different way. 
   I ask everyone to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1427, FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule on this very important piece of legislation and to commend Chairman Frank and the members of the Financial Services Committee for the wonderful work that they have done in getting this important reform measure back to the floor of this House. 
   As it was said earlier, and I will simply repeat, that this is a good rule. This is a rule that has opened up opportunities for those who have amendments to get those amendments before the floor. As Mr. Frank said, there are more amendments that are being allowed on this bill today than were allowed on the bill that came before the House last year on the reform of these GSEs. 
   This is an important piece of legislation where a lot of work has been done to get a consensus about how to reform the GSEs and to open up more opportunities for those who need to be supported on the secondary market for mortgages. 
   This is important because we have had a lot of fights in the Congress of the United States about the GSEs. There were those who for many, many months simply defended the GSEs. We were frightened that we would lose this important resource, and we were suspicious of accusations that were being made about the way that they managed the GSEs, and we did not go along with some of the changes that were being recommended some time ago. 
   But we have all worked very hard and we have compromised. Not only have the defenders of the GSEs decided that it was time for strong regulation and that OFHEO had indeed not done the job and given the oversight that they should have given, we also looked very closely at what was going on with the FM Watch organization that had been created. And while we will agree that there were those in the financial services community who thought that the GSEs were creeping into the retail market, and we still believe that some of what was done was all about potential competition, the one thing that we have agreed on is this. 
   The GSEs are extremely important. They were organized to provide these opportunities to support them on the secondary market, and we cannot lose it, and there were some management problems. There were some accounting problems. Many careers have been destroyed in all of the fighting that has gone on. OFHEO has been dismantled. We have come up with good regulation and oversight, and it is time for us to move forward and not to simply oppose this bill and this rule because we think one has to be the loyal opposition, opposing whatever comes to the floor. 
   It's time to recognize that if we want to do something about creating and supporting housing opportunities, if we want to deal with what is happening in the subprime market, if we understand what we're going through in America today, with all of these foreclosures, with people being very frightened about whether or not they are going to be able to hold on to their home, if we understand all of this, we will move very quickly, not only to support the rule but to support the bill and a very important aspect of this bill, and that is the housing trust fund. 
   How can you be against helping Americans who just want a little piece of the American dream, to be able to own a home? We need to supply more spots. We need more housing. We need to build affordable housing. We're not taking any money away from our general fund. We're not taking any of the revenue that is being counted on to be used for other things in this huge budget. This is new money. This is money that's created from the after-profit taxes of these GSEs. It does not threaten our budget at all.  
   How can you be against building new affordable homes for people who need it all over this country, not just in the cities but in the towns and in the suburbs and certainly in the rural communities? We have people who are living in homes that are not fit for humans to live in. We have people still in some places in the deep South that don't have toilets and running water. We have folks who are living in some of the housing and trailers that are falling apart. We need the housing trust fund. We need this reform. We need this rule, and I would ask support for it all.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation, and I commend the chairman for the work that he has done, the leadership he has provided and the hard work of the Members of this committee to get this bill to the floor. 
   There are no great issues that separate us on this bill. We have worked out all of those issues. We all agree there should be stronger oversight. We all agree that we had to get rid of OFHEO, we had to have a stronger agency. We were all concerned about the tremendous debt of the GSEs. So that is all behind us. There is only one thing that separates us, and that is the Housing Trust Fund, and that is philosophical. 
   We believe that given the housing crisis in America we have a responsibility to assist those who cannot afford decent housing, who are living on the streets, who are paying much more than 30 percent of their income. We believe we have a responsibility to assist them, to help them.     
   The other side of the aisle does not believe that government should play any role in helping the least of these get into public housing. 
   The generally accepted definition of affordability is for a household to pay no more than 30 percent of its annual income on housing. Families who pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing are considered cost burdened, and often have difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing, transportation and medical care. 
   We are not talking about housing for any one section of this country. It is all over this country. In Mr. Boehner's district, the Eighth District: 64,759 renter households, including 14,713 extremely low-income households. Of these extremely poor households, 57 percent are paying more than half of their incomes for housing. In the Eighth District, there is a deficit of 7,497 units that are affordable and available to extremely poor households. 
   In Mr. Blunt's district, the Seventh District of Missouri: 76,034 rental households, including 13,885 extremely low-income households. Of these extremely poor households, 57 percent are paying more than half of their incomes for housing. In the Seventh District, there is a deficit of 7,580 units that are affordable and available to extremely poor households. 
   But let's not stop there. In Mr. Bachus' district, in the Sixth District of Alabama: 55,217 renter households, including 9,525 extremely low-income households. Of these extremely poor households, 50 percent are paying more than half of their incomes for housing. In the Sixth District, there is a deficit of 4,141 units that are affordable and available to extremely poor households. 
   I could go on and on. This is about the housing trust fund. I would ask my colleagues to support the least of us in America, and reject the argument from the other side of the aisle.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have reached a very interesting point in this debate and in this discussion. It has been a long one and it has been a rather interesting one. This amendment that my friend, Mr. Neugebauer, is attempting was attempted in committee and it was defeated. 
   I find it very interesting because we have seen all kinds of attempts here this evening by the opposite side of the aisle to deny this Housing Fund. We have seen attempts to try to diminish or cut the Housing Fund, to redefine the Housing Fund, to use it for economic development. We have seen everything. And we are at the point now that I guess if you can't stop it, somehow cap it. Cap it no matter how much money under this formula it will bring in. We are going to take an arbitrary amount at $520 million or so and just cap it, even if the actual funds under the formula exceed the estimated $600 million a year. I don't think so. 
   I would ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment again because it does not make good sense. This particular fund that has been developed by our chairman is one of the most creative items that have happened here in this House in a long time. 
   We don't have a lot of money to do some of the things we need to be doing for the domestic agenda. As a matter of fact, yes, we support PAYGO because our deficit has gotten out of hand. Our friends on the opposite side of the aisle, in cooperation with this administration, have been spending like drunken sailors. So now we have a way that we can help the least of these in our society attain quality, decent housing, low and moderate income people, and not tap the general fund at all. 
   And so we have this very, very creative way to do this led by our chairman. And a lot of people are going to benefit from it. And again, we have had attempts to deny it, and now we have an attempt to cap it. 
   I am saying we should not support this amendment. We should debate it in the way that we have been debating basically this Housing Trust Fund all evening. You have tried everything that you can possibly think of. You have tried to redefine it. You have tried to talk about it in different ways that certainly it was not meant to be described. And you are not winning at this. As a matter of fact, I am hoping that since you are now at the point where you see that there is a lot of support for this Housing Trust Fund, and that you have tried everything that you can possibly try and it hasn't worked, that you will just fold your tent, roll over, come on in, and in the final analysis, vote for this bill which will include this Housing Trust Fund. 
   I am so tired. I don't have another word that I can share about it. And I hope you feel the same way, too, so we can wrap it up and go home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members, I am surprised at the information that is being given from my friends on the opposite side of the aisle about this bill. Mr. Garrett from New Jersey gets up and talks about the mortgage tax increase. There is no MTI. He made that up. There is no MTI identified in and for this bill. I don't know where they're getting this from. They have vivid imaginations, and they would have you believe that somehow, in order to create this housing trust fund and have the GSEs participate in it, there must be something that they've made up called a mortgage tax increase. 
   Did anyone tell my friends on the opposite side of the aisle that the GSEs have many places they can take the money from? 
   First of all, it is important for everyone to know and understand, this money does not come from the general fund. This money does not come from something called an MTI. This is after-profit tax from the GSEs. And they have all of these programs, they have not only programs that they could eliminate, they could rearrange, and get millions of dollars from, but the investors, instead of getting huge profits, they could be reduced a little bit so that money could go into this housing trust fund. 
   You would think that the Members on the opposite side of the aisle don't have a housing crisis in their district. Well, I've been to Alabama. I've been in Mr. Bachus' district. I want to tell you, he's got some terrible housing problems. He's got a crisis. 
   But Mr. Hensarling does, too. I don't know where those letters are coming from, but let me tell you about his district. Renter households, 81,740 including 14,931 extremely low income households in Mr. Hensarling's district. 
   Of these extremely poor households, 56 percent of them are paying more than half of their incomes for housing. In this district, there's a deficit of 9,571 units that are affordable and available to extremely poor households. 
   I don't mind speaking up for the least of these and poor. I don't mind trying to help the people in my district. But I do mind carrying the burden for all over America, for districts where there are people in need, and somehow their representatives forget to represent them. 
   And my friend would have you believe that he's so concerned about the safety and soundness of these GSEs, and that they want independent world class regulation. And we've created that in this bill, we have compromised, we have worked with them, we have put a new agency in. We have done a great job. 
   Are you willing to sacrifice that because you don't believe the government should participate in helping the least of these get some low income housing? Are you willing to give up all that we have worked for to ensure that we have GSEs that are safe and sound because you don't want to help poor people, low income people, people who work every day but simply cannot afford to own a home or have a decent place to live?     
   I don't think so. I know some of my friends on the opposite side of the aisle may have some questions about how this is all going to work, but I really don't believe that what you mean is that you would give up this bill; that you would rather not see this bill passed, with all of the good that is in it, even FM Watch that was organized some time ago to deal with bringing down the GSEs or supporting this housing trust fund. These are your friends that you have worked with. They like the bill and they like the housing trust fund, and they have letters of support that they have passed out all over this Congress. 
   So I would say that even if you have some questions, you don't quite understand it, understand this: A housing crisis, people in need, moneys that can be gotten from GSEs that does not create something called an MTI, that can help people to have a decent quality of life. Just understand that. And couple that with the knowledge that you have worked very hard to make sure that these GSEs are safe and sound and you don't want to give that up at this point. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Hastings of Florida). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND RAPID TRANSITION TO HOUSING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7221, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act. This is a major piece of legislation that has taken an enormous amount of work to bring to this point. I believe that, if enacted, this bill would substantially improve HUD's McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance programs, by far the largest component of the Federal response to homelessness, with an annual appropriation in the last fiscal year of $1.586 billion. 
   Before getting to the substance of the bill, first I'd like to acknowledge the work of Senators REED and ALLARD, who both worked diligently for many years on S. 1518, the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act. Senator Reed and his staff, in particular, devoted enormous amounts of time to this issue. Due to scheduling factors beyond their control, the Senate was not able to send the bill over to us, but H.R. 7221 certainly reflects all of their work, including the personal commitment of time by the Senators to come over to this side to testify before my Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee last October. 
   I would also like to remember my late colleague, Representative Julia Carson, who introduced H.R. 840, the original HEARTH Act, and worked tirelessly on the bill until her untimely passing. I believe that she would be proud of the work we have undertaken to bring her bill to this consensus outcome. I am so pleased that her grandson, Representative ANDR&#201; CARSON, is an original cosponsor of H.R. 7221. 
   I would also like to thank Representative GWEN MOORE, who stepped into Representative Carson's shoes and spearheaded the further movement of this bill. I appreciate Representative Moore's commitment, because addressing homelessness--starting with reauthorizing the HUD's McKinney-Vento programs for the first time in 14 years--was a top priority for my subcommittee. This bill is informed by 2 days of subcommittee hearings in the fall, at which 26 witnesses testified on the HEARTH Act. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Representative GEOFF DAVIS and Representative JUDY BIGGERT for their tireless and passionate advocacy on behalf of homeless children and their families. Representative Davis is the lead Republican cosponsor of H.R. 840, the version of HEARTH that we marked up in the Financial Services Committee on July 31. Representative Biggert, formerly the ranking member of my subcommittee, is one of Congress's leading advocates for vulnerable families and their children. I am proud to say that both of them, as well as Ranking Member CAPITO, are also original cosponsors of H.R. 7221. 
   This is because we, as well as Chairman Frank, remained committed to continuing our dialogue on the heart-wrenching issue of who qualifies as ``homeless'' under the HUD McKinney-Vento programs, even after a challenging markup. Thanks to this shared commitment to improving HUD's homeless programs, despite strong disagreement among well-intentioned outside stakeholders, we were able to negotiate a compromise that allows us to move forward. 
   To be clear, the conversation around the definition is not over. Indeed, the leadership of the Financial Services and Education and Labor Committees, as well as Representatives BIGGERT and DAVIS, just sent a letter to the GAO to obtain the best information available so that we can continue the discussion productively. I look forward to working with them to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable families and children obtain the housing and social services they need. 
   Notably, while we were considering H.R. 840, they released important new data on homelessness. First, the number of chronically homeless people living in the Nation's streets and shelters has dropped by about 30 percent in the last 2 years. This impressive reduction of people stuck in the homeless system for literally years at a time is largely the result of targeting a portion of HUD McKinney-Vento resources over the last decade to an effective intervention--permanent supportive housing. Therefore, in reauthorizing these programs, we wanted to make sure not to lose this focus in HUD's homeless programs. 
   Unfortunately, HUD also reported a more discouraging statistic--that fully 1.6 million people experienced homelessness over the course of the year studied.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much. 
   Too many of these are families with children. Over time, we have learned that the best way to stop family homelessness is to prevent families from having to enter the homeless system at all, and to move those who do enter it back into permanent housing as quickly as possible. In reauthorization, then, we also wanted to increase resources available to homeless and at-risk families. 
   H.R. 7221 strikes the right balance between these two goals. In terms of permanent supportive housing, the bill ensures a continued commitment to this intervention, both by setting a floor on the annual investment HUD must make to new permanent supportive housing, and equally importantly, places the renewal funding of rental assistance and operating subsidies to existing permanent supportive housing on firm footing. 
   With respect to homeless families and children, the bill, first, revolutionizes the approach of HUD's formula ESG grant. Today, this program receives only 10 percent of the annual appropriation, and a mere third of that, about 3 percent of the total appropriation, can be spent on homeless prevention. The ``Emergency Solutions Program'' created by this bill emphasizes the solution we know works, namely, homelessness prevention. Therefore, a minimum of half of the now 20 percent of the annual appropriation dedicated to the new ESG program must be spent on homelessness prevention; that is, on households that don't fall into the HUD definition of homelessness. 
   Second, H.R. 7221 expands the definition of homelessness to include doubled-up and other poorly housed families who face the loss of their current housing within the next 2 weeks, as well as clarifying that anyone fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence or another dangerous condition is to be considered homeless. 
   Finally, as a result of our discussions after markup, we have also included doubled-up and otherwise poorly housed families who have not lived independently for a period of time, and have undergone a series of moves that harm children, and face significant obstacles--such as disabilities or multiple barriers to employment--to obtaining stable, independent permanent housing.  
   Third, the newly created flexibility to use up to 10 percent of their funding to serve families  with children and unaccompanied youth defined as homeless under other Federal statutes but not under the HUD definition, acknowledges the incredibly vulnerable status of these families--and our duty to prevent them from a cycle of falling from their current doubled-up or other poorly housed situations into the shelters or onto the streets, or continuing on a merry-go-round of doubled up housing situations that wreak havoc on their children. 
   This brings between 20 and 30 percent of the annual appropriation, and perhaps more, that will be available to homeless housing and services providers who want to serve families with children who are doubled up or otherwise don't meet the HUD definition of homelessness. Rural areas receive even more flexibility to serve households who don't fall under the expanded HUD definition of homelessness to rural communities, responding to what we heard at the hearings--that homelessness doesn't look the same in rural areas as in big cities. In sum, we have truly maximized the resources available to homeless children and families. And, let's be clear, it's a lot of new resources--a multiple of 10 or more times the 3 percent available under current law. 
   I would conclude simply by noting that the improvements I just described are coupled with a significant consolidation and streamlining of HUD's administration of the McKinney-Vento programs. In sum, this bill is a major step forward in Federal homeless policy and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (ALLOWING USE OF PASSENGER FACILITY FEES FOR NOISE REDUCTION AT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I would like first to thank Congresswoman Laura Richardson for allotting me time to speak on this bill that I have coauthored with Congresswoman Jane Harman. I thank her for her interest. 
   I had an opportunity to talk with Congresswoman Laura Richardson on our way to the floor, where she told me about similar problems that she has encountered in the Long Beach area dealing with the Long Beach Airport. So I know of her concern, and I thank her for the interest that she is showing in this bill. 
   Of course I rise in strong support of S. 996, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 1708, a bill, again, that was introduced by Congresswoman Jane Harman and myself. This bill permits funding for noise mitigation in local schools in the cities of Inglewood and Lennox.  
   The city of Inglewood is located in my district. Mr. Speaker and Members, this is a proud little city of 17,750 students. We have 13 elementary schools, six secondary schools, one preschool, and one community adult school in the Inglewood Unified School District. These schools are very, very important to this community. 
   In 2005, the City of Los Angeles settled a lawsuit with the Inglewood and Lennox School Districts. Under the settlement, the Los Angeles World Airports, known as LAWA, agreed to provide the two cities funding for noise mitigation in local schools; however, Federal Aviation Administration rules have prevented the funds from being paid. S. 996 will allow the 2005 agreement to go forward. 
   Specifically, S. 996 allows Los Angeles World Airports to use airport passenger facility fees for noise mitigation projects at Lennox and Inglewood schools. The bill permits funding of $111 million for the Lennox District and $118.5 million for the Inglewood School District over 10 years. 
   As you know, Los Angeles International Airport is in my district. And I represent not only Inglewood, but several other communities in this district and this very important economic engine, the Los Angeles International Airport. And there are many issues that we are confronted with. 
   I belong to a strong coalition in the district working to make sure that we, of course, maintain and support this economic engine, but at the same time, make sure that we attend to the needs of the people and deal with the noise and disruption that is caused by the Los Angeles International Airport. 
   It is sometimes a challenge, and we cannot always take the side of our international airport. We have to be concerned about the quality of life for all of the people in that area, and particularly our school children. Airplanes arriving at and departing from Los Angeles International Airport cause excessive noise in my district. Deafening noise and rattling windows frequently interfere with the education of school children. Noise causes disruptions in lessons, making it very difficult for students to learn and diminishing the opportunity to study in a stable and calm environment. Noise mitigation funding is essential to allow the school districts to construct permanent sound-proof facilities and help soundproof existing schools. 
   This bill was drafted with the assistance of the Federal Aviation Administration and has the support of the Inglewood and Lennox School Districts, the Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), and the mayor of the City of Los Angeles. 
   Again, I would like to thank Congresswoman Harman for initiating this much-needed solution to the problems of noise and disruption that interferes with our children's ability to learn in a noise-free school environment.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (DARFUR ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 180 and a member of the Financial  Services Committee, which passed this bill last week. 
   The ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan already is believed to have caused the deaths of almost half a million people. More than 200,000 people have been killed by Sudanese government forces and armed militias since 2003, and another 200,000 people have died as a result of the deliberate destruction of homes, crops and water supplies and the resulting conditions of famine and disease. More than 2.5 million people have been displaced. 
   According to a recent United Nations report, attacks against humanitarian aid workers have increased 150 percent in the past year. There are currently 13,000 humanitarian aid workers in Darfur, providing aid to more than 4 million people, and violence limits their ability to reach people in need. In June, approximately one in six humanitarian convoys leaving the capitals of Darfur provinces were ambushed by armed groups. About two-thirds of the population of Darfur is dependent upon these courageous aid workers and the aid they bring. 
   Early in 2006, I visited the Darfur region with my good friend from California, Speaker NANCY PELOSI, and I was deeply disturbed by what I saw. As far as the eyes could see, there were crowds of displaced people who had been driven from their homes, living literally on the ground with little tarps just covering them. That was over a year ago, and yet this genocide has been allowed to continue. 
   The world stood by and watched the genocide that occurred in Rwanda. The world has noted over and over again the atrocities of the Holocaust. Yet we cannot seem to get the international community to move fast enough to stop the genocide that is taking place in Darfur. 
   The Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act is a concrete proposal to impose sanctions on the Government of Sudan and on corporations that continue to do business with this genocidal regime. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I hope that it will be enacted and implemented in time to save lives, allow humanitarian aid to continue, and force the Government of Sudan to stop this genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. WATERS. (SHIRLEY A. CHISHOLM UNITED STATES-CARIBBEAN EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 176; the Shirley A. Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. 
   The Shirley A. Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act creates an educational exchange program to enable students from the countries of the Caribbean Community to come to the U.S. and study at an American college or university. The bill requires program participants to return to a Caribbean country or work for the growth, progress and development of the Caribbean Community after they complete their studies. The bill also creates a program to improve primary and secondary education in the Caribbean Community through teacher training, strengthening curriculum, and improving administration and management of schools. 
   Many Caribbean leaders have received post-secondary education in the U.S. and have used their education to strengthen Caribbean democracy and benefit Caribbean people. For example, from 2003 through 2005, a total of 217 Caribbean leaders participated in U.S. exchange programs dealing with counter-narcotics, anticorruption and good governance policies. The Shirley A. Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act would expand these efforts to include future Caribbean leaders. 
   It is entirely appropriate that this legislation is named after our former colleague, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. Congresswoman Chisholm was of Caribbean heritage and was a strong advocate for quality education. She graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946, received a Masters in Elementary Education from the Teachers College at Columbia University in 1952, and went on to work as a teacher. In 1968, she became the first African-American woman elected to Congress, where she served with distinction from 1969 to 1983. In 1972, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm ran for president in the Democratic primaries. As a Member of Congress, Shirley Chisholm served on the influential Education and Labor Committee and rose to be its third-highest ranking member. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to honor Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm and support educational exchange opportunities for Caribbean students by voting in favor of the Shirley A. Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Chairman Frank, who just spoke, is absolutely correct. This is a very exciting day, a day that so many housing advocates and working people and poor people have been waiting for. They get a chance to see their government responding to one of the most critical needs in our society. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2895, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, and I sincerely thank Chairman Frank for his unrelenting efforts to get the Federal Government back in the affordable housing production business. 
   I am so proud to be part of this committee, to be a cosponsor of this bill and to work with Chairman Frank in not only producing housing under this National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but for all the other work that has been coming out of this committee under his leadership. 
   The need for this bill could not be more urgent. Mr. Chairman, last week you joined me when I chaired a hearing in the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee that demonstrated that when affordable housing is not produced, homelessness is. The stark bottom line that emerged from the hearing, focused narrowly on reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, is that, nationwide, we haven't made demonstrable progress in reducing the number of households experiencing homelessness in the past two decades. While some homeless people face personal challenges that require social services or other support, every homeless individual and family shares one common need: Housing they can afford. And there simply is not enough of it. 
   For example, there are 9 million renter households who earn less than 30 percent of area median income, but only 6.2 million units affordable to them. This leaves an absolute deficit of 2.8 affordable rental housing units for our poorest families. This kind of math leads inevitably to widespread homelessness. But I want to emphasize that the National Housing Trust Fund addresses the affordable housing crisis as it affects every level of society. 
   Right now, housing costs are outstripping wages for more households than ever before in recent memory. According to the ``Harvard University Study on the State of the Nation's Housing in 2007,'' 17 million renters and homeowners are paying more than half their incomes in housing costs. 
   Working is simply no longer a guarantee of being able to afford housing. In Los Angeles, for example, it takes an hourly wage of over $22 an hour to afford a moderately priced two-bedroom apartment, when the minimum wage in California is only $7.50 an hour. Put another way, a two-parent family with both parents working full-time at minimum-wage jobs puts that family less than two-thirds of the way to being able to afford decent housing. 
   Finally, as a recent Center for Housing Policy study ``Paycheck to Paycheck'' dramatically shows, many of our Nation's essential workers cannot afford to live in or near the communities where they work. In high-cost communities like Los Angeles where the median home price is $523,000, the income needed to afford a home is far higher than that earned by teachers, police, firefighters, nurses and other key occupations studied. The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund addresses this full range of housing crises, providing relief to overburdened renters and homeowners, while targeting funds where the need is greatest. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize that H.R. 2895 does so at no additional cost to taxpayers. It is a trust fund in the truest sense, a dedicated source of revenue, separate and apart from the annual appropriations process, reflecting the need for the Federal Government to make a long overdue commitment to affordable housing production. 
   We have clearly demonstrated that the fund will be drawn from moneys from the affordable housing fund proposed as part of the GSE reform bill, H.R. 1427, from Federal Housing Administration savings and other existing revenue streams. I am prepared to debate with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle whether such revenues should be diverted to uses other than addressing the housing needs of America's working families and poorest, disabled individuals. I do not think there is any better use for them, particularly since both GSE and FHA revenues derive from housing activities that the Federal Government and government-sponsored enterprises engage in, at significant profit to both, I might add. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, it has been 17 years since the Federal Government last enacted a major affordable housing production program, spearheaded in 1990 by, Mr. Chairman, your predecessor, Chairman Gonzalez. The time has long since passed to enact another one. 
   I am so proud of this legislation. I am so thankful, Chairman Frank, for your leadership. And I am so proud and pleased to have the opportunity at this time in my career not only to work on the committee with you and to chair this subcommittee, but to be able to stand here today and see something about to happen that has been needed for so long.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. 
   Chairman Frank, I applaud you for your willingness to modify the trust fund proposal as it has moved through this Chamber to reflect the realities of the housing market while simultaneously keeping your eye on the prize, a significant increase in the production of affordable housing for the very poorest Americans. This amendment continues to maintain such a balance. 
   Let me share some simple math with my colleagues. The monthly SSI payment in California is $836. As the Brooke amendment established, the Federal Government considers an affordable rent to be 30 percent of that income, or $250 per month. Nobody can operate housing anywhere in California, much less in high-cost areas like Los Angeles, for $250 per unit monthly. It doesn't matter whether you're a nonprofit or for-profit or whether you have significant debt service on loans for the capital, or if someone has just handed you a brand new building for free. As the green eye shade types in the real estate business say, it just ``doesn't pencil out.'' 
   This need to address the operating cost shortfall in projects targeted to the lowest income folks, especially those at SSI income levels and below, is not news to those of us who have been fighting for a national affordable housing trust fund for over half a decade. Nor, to be clear, does it suggest that there's any shortage of need for plain old low-cost bricks and sticks capital grants which will comprise the vast majority of funding under H.R. 2895, even if this amendment is adopted. What has become clear, though, is that the State and local housing agencies need some flexibility with the trust fund dollars to address the operating shortfall issue in order for the trust fund to generate the greatest number of new units for the poorest, most disabled residents of trust fund projects. 
   Critically, neither this amendment nor the underlying bill discourages grantees from seeking other sources of operating subsidies or rental assistance. Indeed, it requires as much. Even the full 10 percent of the trust fund in a given year, should States and localities choose to use the maximum permitted to operate accounts, will not come close to providing the total amount of operating subsidy needed to achieve the trust fund's targeting goals. So grantees like my own California Housing Finance Agency or Los  Angeles City Housing Department will have no choice but to leverage trust funds with section 8, McKinney-Vento subsidies and State or local rental assistance programs. 
   But this flexibility will ensure that some projects can move forward that otherwise could not in the current environment, where section 8, for example, has been under attack since the moment the trust fund movement began. That is the essence of the trust fund bill that you have championed, Chairman Frank, recognizing and overcoming the obstacles to affordable housing production for the poorest people in this country. This amendment is wholly consistent with that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support that.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (IRAN -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. The subject of my Special Order is Iran. 
   Madam Speaker, at the time the war in Iraq began in March of 2003, who would have thought that we were being led into perhaps the worst foreign policy disaster in America's history? Many of us voted against the war authorization in the first place. But many more Members wish they had voted against it. We now know that this country was led into this war with faulty intelligence and a deafening war drum from the administration. 
   The question that we raise tonight is this: Could the Bush administration possibly be planning for a war with Iran? There isn't any empirical evidence to prove that the Bush administration is planning for war. But there are experts that are indeed worried that the same playbook that was used to bring this country into the Iraq war is now being used to toward Iran. The administration is pushing suspect intelligence. And it has severely increased and sharpened since their rhetoric first began toward Iran. 
   We come to the floor tonight to resist efforts by this administration to paint war with Iran as a necessary next step in our so-called war on terror. A vast majority of foreign policy and military experts agree that war with Iran would be a colossal error. 
   Allow me to spend a few minutes to explain why I feel that U.S. strikes against Iran are a real possibility. Let us look at some of the signs that we may be headed for war. The increased rhetoric. The administration is building the volume of inflammatory rhetoric toward Iran in a similar fashion to the run-up to the Iraq war. Strong statements about Iran's intervention in Iraq could set the stage for U.S. attack on Iranian military or nuclear facility. 
   Surrogates in the administration, including the President himself, have increasingly stressed a full range of negative Iranian behavior, including that Iran is killing U.S. soldiers in Iraq, supplying weapons, training and funding to special groups. 
   They also say that Iran is interfering with the peace process in the Middle  East. And they go on to talk about General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker as they argued that Iran is the major future threat to stability in Iraq. 
   Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons. When this point was dismissed by the recent National Intelligence Estimate stating that Iran had long since halted their nuclear enrichment, the administration criticized the report. 
   Allow me to read a short selection of clips from recent press clippings that expose the irresponsible rhetoric coming from the Bush administration. This headline from the Daily Telegraph on April 7, 2008: British Fear U.S. Commander is Beating the Drum for Iran Strikes. ``British officials gave warning yesterday that America's commander in Iraq will declare that Iran is waging war against the U.S.-backed Baghdad Government. A strong statement from General David Petraeus about Iran's intervention in Iraq could set the stage for a U.S. attack on Iranian military facilities, according to a Whitehall assessment.'' 
   Another headline: Petraeus Says Iranian-Backed Groups Are Greatest Threat to Iraq. This is in the Bloomberg News April 9, 2008. ``The so-called `special groups,' which are funded, trained and armed by Iran, played a `destructive role' in the recent clashes between extremist militias and Iraqi Government forces in Basra and Baghdad, Petraeus said. `Iran has fueled the violence in a particularly damaging way,' he told the House Armed Services Committee today in Washington, his second day of testimony to lawmakers. `Unchecked, the `special groups' pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a Democratic Iraq.'' 
   Again, that was the Bloomberg News, April 9, 2008. 
   Another headline, the Voice of America, April 2, 2008, Israel to Redistribute Gas Masks Amid Fears of War with Iran. 
   ``Israel's security Cabinet has decided to redistribute gas masks to the entire population amid fears of a nonconventional war with Iran. The last distribution was just before the U.S. invasion of Iraq 4 years ago.'' 
   Another headline in the New York Times, April 12, 2008. The headline reads, Iran Fighting Proxy War in Iraq, U.S. Envoy Says. 
   ``Iran is engaging in a proxy war with the United States in Iraq, adopting tactics similar to those it has used to back fighters in Lebanon, the United States ambassador to Iraq said Friday. While Bush administration officials have long denounced what they have described as Iran's meddling in Iraq, Mr. Crocker's language was unusually strong from Mr. Bush down, administration officials this week have been turning up the volume on Iran.'' 
   A further sign that the U.S. may be headed for war is Admiral Fallon's resignation. In the aftermath of the disastrous invasion of Iraq, there has been discussion within media and in the military that senior military officers should have resigned when they knew the White House to be heading to a reckless war in Iraq. 
   Some are speculating that the recent retirement of Admiral Fallon is a direct result of his steadfast opposition to war with Iran. He even made his disagreements with the administration public before his retirement. 
   In a now-famous profile that Admiral Fallon agreed to do for Esquire magazine, he was characterized as the only man standing between war with Iran. 
   Let me read an excerpt from that article. 
   This was Esquire magazine, March 11, 2008. The title is ``The Man Between War and Peace.'' The article goes on to say that if in the dying light of the Bush administration, we go to war with Iran, it will all come down to one man. If we do not go to war with Iran, it will all come down to one, that same man. So while Admiral Fallon's boss, President George W. Bush, regularly trash-talks his way to world war III and his administration casually casts Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as this century's Hitler, a crown it has awarded once before, to deadly effect, it's left to Fallon, and apparently Fallon alone, to argue that, as he told al Jazeera last fall, this constant drumbeat of conflict is not helpful and not useful. 
   Another sign that the U.S. may be thinking about war is the offensive against the Mahdi Army. Moqtada al Sadr has promised full-scale attacks on America's interests in Iraq in the event of strikes on Iran. As commander of the multinational force in Iraq, General David Petraeus still presides as the commander of the Iraqi security forces as well. Any operation against the Mahdi Army would have been authorized by him. What motivation did the United States have in fueling a violent confrontation with the powerful militia at a time when al Sadr had declared a truce and the progress of the surge was being reported to Congress? 
   One explanation is that recent operations against al Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army, may have been meant to neutralize possible resistance inside of Iraq in the event of a strike on Iran.     
   The following five reasons are taken verbatim from an article in U.S. News and World Report that was published on March 5th entitled ``Six Signs the U.S. May Be Headed For War in Iran.'' 
   Before I go into the five reasons that I have taken verbatim from this article in U.S. News and World Report, I am going to recognize the Congresswoman from Oakland, California, Barbara Lee, who is cochair of the Progressive Caucus. She is one of the co-founders of the Out of Iraq Caucus. She has been consistent in her resistance to this war in Iraq. 
   She is an organizer. She is a constant speaker on the speaking engagement circuit, speaking with groups and organizations all over this country who want to hear from Barbara Lee about what is going on in Congress. 
   The question she is most confronted with is when will this Congress end the war and bring our soldiers home? What are you going to do about a President who is ignoring the will of the people and ignoring the will of Congress in their attempts to resist the continued funding of the war? Every weekend, somewhere in this country, Barbara Lee is attempting to answer those questions and engage the American citizens about what is happening here. 
   I yield to Barbara Lee.

   We have been joined by another one of our colleagues who too has been consistent in his opposition to this war. From the very day that he first came to this chamber, he made it clear where he stood on this war. He has joined with us on the floor on many other occasions and it is a constant part of his agenda wherever he is to remind people that we are in a war that makes no sense, where lives are being lost, and hopes and dreams are being dashed. 
   He brings a special kind of understanding about what is going on because of his familiarity with the Arab nations and with Islam, and he has done a wonderful job of helping to teach and introduce to the Members of this Congress other cultures and helping us to understand how they operate, what they are all about, and helping us to gain respect for those that sometimes are singled out for war, when, of course, problems and issues could be handled with diplomacy. 
   I am proud to yield time to Representative Keith Ellison to sound the alarm.

   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much, I am so pleased and proud to have been joined by my colleagues here this evening to sound the alarm. Let me say that again, we are sounding the alarm. We are opening up the debate. We are raising the questions. We are challenging this administration on the issue of war with Iran. 
   We are saying, Mr. President, we have watched, we have listened, and we have learned. We are smarter people when we hear talk about war, when we hear accusations being made. When we hear a march to war we now recognize it for what it is. It is a given that we have this knowledge that we have acquired since we have been here since the start of the war with Iraq. We do not intend to sit idly by without opening up the discussion, without making the challenge, without raising the questions. 
   As I said, prior to the opening lines of the presentation that was just given by Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, there were signs of war that have been identified, not only by some of the experts that we have been talking to, but by those who have been writing and watching what has been going on. 
   As I mentioned before, there is talk, and there are news articles. 
   U.S. News & World Report, published on March 11, title, ``6 Signs the U.S. May Be Headed for War in Iran.'' Let me repeat that, U.S. News & World Report published on March 11 titled ``6 Signs the U.S. May Be Headed for War in Iran.'' 
   Warships off of Lebanon, with the Army fully engaged in Iraq, much the contingency planning for possible military action has fallen to the Navy, which has looked at the use of carrier-based war planes and sea launch missiles as the weapons to destroy Iran's air defenses and nuclear infrastructure. 
   ``Two U.S. warships took up positions off Lebanon earlier this month, replacing the USS Cole. The deployment was said to signal U.S. concern over the political stalemate in Lebanon and the influence of Syria in that country. But the United States also would want its warships in the eastern Mediterranean in the event of military action against Iran to keep Iranian ally Syria in check and to help provide air cover to Israel against Iranian missile reprisals. One of the newly deployed ships, the USS Ross, is an Aegis guided missile destroyer, a top system missile defense against air attacks.'' 
   This article goes on to talk about ``Vice President Cheney's peace trip: Cheney, who is seen as a leading hawk on Iran, is going on what is described as a Mid East trip to try to give a boost to stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he has also scheduled two other stops: One, Oman, is a key military and ally and logistics hub for military operations in the Persian Gulf. It also faces Iran across the narrow, vital Strait of Hormuz, the vulnerable oil transit choke point into and out of the Persian Gulf that Iran has threatened to blockade in the event of war. Cheney is also going to Saudi Arabia, whose support would be sought before any military action given its ability to increase oil supplies, if Iran's oil is cut off. Back in March, 2002, Cheney made a high-profile Mid East trip to Saudi Arabia and other nations that officials said at the time was about diplomacy to Iraq and not war, which began a year later.'' 
   Vice President Cheney has been on that trip, as we pretty well know, based on the advanced intelligence revealed by this very, very well-placed article. 
   They go on to talk about the Israeli air strike on Syria.     
   Israel's air strike deep in Syria last October was reported to have targeted a nuclear-related facility, but details have remained sketchy, and some experts have been skeptical that Syria had a covert nuclear program. 
   An alternative scenario floating in Israel and Lebanon is that the real purpose of the strike was to force Syria to switch on the targeted electronics for newly received Russian anti-aircraft defenses. The location of the strike is seen as on a likely flight path to Iran. That is also crossing the friendly Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Knowing the electronic signatures of the defensive systems is necessary to reduce the risk for warplanes heading to targets in Iran. 
   They go on to give the other identification markers that should be watched and should be vetted. 
   Israeli comments. Israeli President Shimon Peres said earlier this month that Israel will not consider unilateral action to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. In the past, though, Israeli officials have quite consistently said that they are prepared to act alone if that becomes necessary to ensure that Iran does not cross a nuclear weapons threshold. Was Peres speaking for himself, or has President Bush given the Israelis an assurance that they won't have to act alone? 
   Israel's war with Hezbollah. While this seems a bit old, Israel's July 2006 war in Lebanon against Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces was seen at the time as a step that Israel would want to take if it anticipated a clash with Iran. The radical Shiite group is seen not only as a threat on its own, but also as a possible Iranian surrogate force in the event of war with Iran. So it was important for Israel to push Hezbollah forces back from their positions on Lebanon's border with Israel and to do enough damage to Hezbollah's Iranian-supplied arsenals to reduce its capabilities. Since then, Hezbollah has been able to rearm through a United Nations force that polices a border buffer zone in southern Lebanon. 
   So as you can see, there is quite a bit of reason to be concerned about the administration's saber-rattling towards Iran. There is no way to prove their intentions, and I hope we are wrong, but we really can't afford to be wrong. 
   Another encounter like in January between the U.S. Navy and an Iranian speedboat could be used as an excuse for retaliation similar to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began the Vietnam War. The White House would simply claim that we were ``provoked'' and were defending ourselves. 
   I would like to stop at this time and yield time to the gentlelady from Houston, Texas, who has been consistent in her work with the Out-of-Iraq Caucus in an attempt to bring our soldiers home. It is with great pleasure that I yield to Congresswoman Jackson-Lee.

   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much to both SHEILA JACKSON-LEE and BARBARA LEE for, again, their constant and consistent struggle working in this House against the war. 
   Mr. Speaker, and Members, press reports have given us some indications of the thrust of current White House directed planning. The strike would be against Iranian terrorist facilities, the Revolutionary Guard units and/or nuclear production facilities, a limited air strike operation with the objective of changing Iranian behavior. Those who argue for the strike are saying there will be very few U.S. casualties and very few Iranian civilian casualties. Nevertheless, we all know that U.S. strikes against Iran would be disastrous. 
   Middle East experts generally agree that Iran would respond to a U.S. strike by attacking U.S. and Israeli interests throughout the region and possibly globally. These strikes would lead to a greater Middle East war, including greater loss of life, financial burden, over stretch of our military and worse. 
   We're sounding the alarm this evening and we are sending a message to the President of the United States of America and to the Vice President, particularly now to the Vice President, who, when he was reminded by an ABC News reporter that the recent polls show that two-thirds of Americans say the fight in Iraq is not worth it, his response, ``and so?'' 
   Well, Mr. Vice President, our ``and so'' to you tonight is, and so the American people do not want us to continue this war in Iraq and to air strike in Iran. We're sounding the alarm. And I will yield time to the gentleman who just left the Speaker's seat to complete this colloquy that we've had here this evening.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, and Members, I am pleased that we have  taken time from our schedules to come to the floor tonight to sound the alarm. The saber rattling is going on by this administration. The remarks that we're hearing day in and day out are more accusatory toward Iran. We are made to believe that we are somehow being placed at a great threat by Iran. 
   And so we know where this is going. We know what this means, and we're saying, we must not rule out diplomacy. We must believe that we can settle differences by way of diplomacy. 
   We know that we've still got work to do on Iraq. We've still got to make many Members of this House feel comfortable with the idea that they can confront their President, that they can still be very, very patriotic as they stand up against war and bringing our soldiers home. We know that the work has to be done, but we've got to add to that work the fact that we can stop an airstrike on Iran and we can stop the notion that somehow we must send more soldiers in.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in strong support of this resolution offered by my colleague, Mr. Green, from Houston commemorating the 40th anniversary of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the 20th anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. 
   The history of the Fair Housing Act embodies both our Nation's most noble instincts and recent behavior by our Federal Government, which should make none of us proud. 
   On April 11, 1968, one week to the day after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congress passed and the President signed into law the Federal Fair Housing Act which now prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, national origin, religion, color, sex, familial status and disability. 
   Acting on this legislation, which has been stalled in this body for over 2 years, was a fitting tribute to Dr. King and reflected a belief that something constructive could be achieved in the aftermath of days of unrest in cities across the country. 
   In 1988, the law was amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act, which significantly strengthened the enforcement powers of the act, giving the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Justice the authority to mandate and to enforce the expanded and comprehensive requirements of the act. Unfortunately, while we can be proud of passing these landmark statutes, the sad fact is that the Fair Housing Act remains the least enforced of our Nation's civil rights laws. 
   Through the work of local housing groups like the Housing Rights Center in my district in Los Angeles, we know that more than 3.7 million people are discriminated against in housing transactions every year, and we are on the brink of an economic crisis fueled by a failed subprime lending market built  primarily on borrowers and neighborhoods of color. 
   The current foreclosure crisis is the outgrowth of persistent discrimination in housing, lending and insurance markets that took place under the negligent eyes of the very Federal agencies charged with enforcing our Nation's antidiscrimination laws. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued only 31 charges of discrimination, and the Department of Justice filed just 35 cases. 
   Sadly, the risk posed by lax enforcement of the Fair Housing Act is no less than the resegregation of America. While we have made some progress in reducing levels of residential segregation, most Americans live in communities largely divided by race and ethnicity. Perhaps more distressingly, our children are attending increasingly segregated schools. Recent research demonstrates that by 2000, minority students were in schools with substantially fewer white students than was the case a decade earlier. We must reduce those troubling trends. 
   To that end, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution offered by Mr. Green, whose dedication to the housing needs of America and America's most vulnerable households is second to that of no other member of the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee, which I chair. 
   Additionally, in my role as Chair, I'm joining Mr. Green in rededicating myself to the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, starting with making plans for a joint hearing with the Constitution Subcommittee, chaired by Mr. Nadler of New York, to hold the inadequate efforts of both HUD and the Department of Justice up to congressional scrutiny.     
   The best way to celebrate the anniversary of the Fair Housing Act is to take concrete actions to enforce both its letter and spirit. 
   Mr. Chairman of our Judiciary Committee, whose lifelong work has been to end discrimination and to enforce fair housing and to enforce civil rights, I just thank you for having the opportunity to work with you.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, Members, last Friday, Retired Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, who led U.S. forces in Iraq following the invasion in  2003, became the latest in a growing list of retired military officers who harshly criticize the war in Iraq. He said that the United States is ``living a nightmare with no end in sight.'' General Sanchez also lambasted the latest strategy in Iraq calling it, again, ``a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war.'' 
   These startling revelations from the highest ranks of our military should shake us to our very core. The man who was personally responsible for conducting the war in Iraq is trying to convince us that we should have no faith in the administration now waging the war. 
   General Sanchez went on to say, ``There has been a glaring unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders,'' and that ``the American people must hold them accountable.'' 
   But, General Sanchez, how can the American people hold their elected officials accountable? As we all know, they can make a lot of noise by calling congressional offices, writing letters, and attending marches; but at the end of the day, the American people hold their elected officials accountable at the ballot box. 
   To my colleagues in the House of Representatives, our constituents have already made up their minds. An overwhelming majority of people think it was a mistake to invade Iraq and believe that setting a timetable for withdrawal is the correct course of action. Most Democrats and Republicans agree that an open-ended occupation of Iraq is an awful idea. But the Iraqi people don't want us there, and we have no timetable for withdrawal. 
   What do we have if not an open-ended occupation? What more do we need to learn before deciding that this war must be brought to a halt? Day after day, the grim realities unfolding in Iraq paint a picture of futility and mismanagement. More lives are lost, more money is squandered, and Iraq falls deeper and deeper into chaos and civil war. 
   President Bush has had our military in pursuit of a victory that is perpetually ``just around the corner.'' Well, we have been around the corner and back again. There is no victory to be found. The time to end this debacle has long since passed. The United States military presence has reinforced in the minds of the Iraqis the most damaging lesson an emerging nation can learn: that problems are solved with bullets and bombs instead of compromise and cooperation. Instead of encouraging compromise and fostering cooperation among the various warring tribes, we have done the exact opposite. We continue to spend billions of dollars blindly arming Iraqis who volunteer to serve in the Iraqi security forces with no thought as to where their loyalties might lie when we hand them weapons. 
   On one hand, as Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out, we have not addressed the degree to which all elements of the Iraqi security forces, from the Prime Minister's office down, have links to Shiite efforts to retain and expand power and carry out sectarian cleansing in mixed areas. 
   On the other hand, the bottom-up reconciliation that Bush brags about is arming and empowering the Sunni militias in Anbar province and elsewhere. This is, as a recent article in the Economist suggests, a recipe for civil war and only serves to undermine the central government of Iraq. 
   These irresponsible and dangerous tactics not only harm future prospects for stability in Iraq, but seriously erode our standing in the Middle East and larger international community. 
   I would like to commend General Sanchez for speaking out against the Bush administration. But how many more General Sanchezes will it take before the last Congressperson turns against the occupation of Iraq? How many more investigations of Blackwater's abuse, of Halliburton's fraud, how many more reports of our overstretched military at its breaking point, or about the damage our occupation is doing to our international standing? How much more of this debate do we need before our national leaders accept that the Iraq war is actually making our country less safe? 
   For the good of this great Nation and for the good of Iraq, it is time to bring our troops home and end the occupation of Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I know that there is an attempt to put a good face on the surge and to try and make us believe that the surge is working, but just read your newspapers every day and see the number of lives that are being lost, not only of our own soldiers, but of the Iraqis.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, today President Bush requested an additional $46 billion war request. This request is on top of an existing $142 billion request pending from earlier this year. 
   The President told reporters that the funding was simply for day-to-day military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. He said that the bill provides for basic needs like bullets and body armor, protection against IEDs, and mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles. 
   The President would lead us to believe that there are only two options in Iraq; Congress must either continue to fund the war indefinitely, or we must choose to pull the rug out from under the troops and strand them in the field without body armor and bullets. This, of course, is a ridiculous characterization of our position. We feel that continuing to referee a civil war in Iraq runs counter to our national security interests. 
   There is no military solution to the war in Iraq no matter how many soldiers, weapons and dollars you dump into the country. Bombs and bullets have not and will not bring us peace in Iraq. I believe there is only one answer to the war in Iraq: a fully funded redeployment of our troops and military contractors. 
   I think a reasonable Member of Congress would welcome a plan from the President on how we're going to safely leave Iraq, and we would be happy to fund it. But asking us to continue funding, providing funds for the occupation of Iraq until President Bush decides to change course is tantamount to asking us to just continue to support the war. 
   The choice is clear; it is time to face the facts: We either provide funds to continue the war or we provide funds to end the war. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I'm bothered by this request. I'm bothered by it because the President is playing politics with the issue. The President of the United States is saying, ``I want this $46 billion and I want it now, and I want to use it for very necessary armor and equipment,'' because he knows that the Members of Congress do not like to be seen in a bad light, having folks believe that somehow they're not providing support for the soldiers. And he keeps testing the will of this Congress with these kinds of antics. 
   We know that the American public wants us out of Iraq. We also know the American public wants to indicate its support for the soldiers who are not there because they've decided that we would go to war, but rather, they answered the President's call because they are patriotic, many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they're there. 
   Everybody supports the soldiers, but the President is trying to set us up. He is trying to set us up so that if we don't immediately vote on this $46 billion it will look as if we are not giving the soldiers the necessary equipment in order to wage the war. This is absolutely ridiculous. 
   And I don't know how long this President thinks he can get along with mismanaging this war in the way that he's doing. We have 101 questions we ought to be forcing on him. First of all, where are the 190,000 weapons that have been lost? Where is the money we were supposed to have been getting from the oil wells in Iraq? Where are the billions of dollars that they sent over in cash in the beginning of this war? What happened to all of that money? 
   We can go on and on and on with questions about Blackwater and the contractors and the mercenaries. We can go on and on about this government that they put together that does not function and will not function. We can ask them, whose side are you on, the Sunnis, the Shias? And now you're trying to manage what Turkey does with the Kurds. The Kurds killed Turkish soldiers. The Turks threatened to go over and invade the Kurdish territory, and now we're over there trying to manage that. It is complicated. We have no business there. 
   This occupation is draining us, not only the lives of young men and women who are there trying to answer the President's call, but the dollars that should be going into comprehensive universal health care, truly supporting Leave No Child Behind, truly supporting moderate and low-income housing, truly being used to rebuild the infrastructure that's falling apart all over America. 
   Come on, Mr. President, don't challenge us this way. There are some of us who know what we're going to do, and others are going to get wise very soon.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. You're certainly welcome, and I thank you for taking this time out this evening, Congresswoman Kaptur, to talk about what is happening in this country with this foreclosure mess that we're in, this sub prime meltdown that we are experiencing. 
   I really came to the floor to commend you and congratulate you for all of the time that you have put in on this issue unraveling some of the history of what has taken place with the banking community with what is going on in our economy today and trying to identify how we got into this situation and what we could do to get out of it. 
   Many of our Members--two are distressed about what is happening in their districts and in their communities, but they don't know nearly the information that you have discovered about this entire unfortunate situation that we are in. 
   Let me just say that I did come to Ohio at your invitation and your delegation's invitation, and I know that you were the leader in helping to pull that delegation together and getting me there to talk about what is going on in Ohio. I was joined, and we were joined, by several members of the Ohio Congressional Delegation each trying to bring attention to the foreclosure devastation that's spread across that State. 
   Again, you have been a persistent voice in our Democratic Caucus for taking bold action on the foreclosure crisis, generally. 
   Let me mention that Representative TUBBS JONES, Representative Kucinich, who was here on the floor, Representative Sutton, Representative Wilson was in attendance, and I think we all learned an awful lot that day. We had great witnesses who came and talked about what is going on in the State, and we discovered since 2005, Cuyahoga County has had the highest number of foreclosures in the State, with Montgomery, Summit, Lucas, and Preble counties rounding out the top five. The 10 largest counties in Ohio accounted for 64 percent of the foreclosure filings in Ohio last year. 
   And according to data from the Mortgage Banking Association, in the fourth quarter of 2007, 7.67 percent of Ohio home loans were past due with 2.01 percent 90 days or more overdue. And during the same period last year, 7.25 percent of Ohio loans were past due with 1.74 percent 90 or more days overdue. 
   Because of the challenges it has faced economically over the past few years with the loss of manufacturing jobs and population from certain parts of the State, Ohio was truly the ``canary in the coal mine'' of the foreclosure crisis--vulnerable to sub prime lending and its aftereffects much earlier than the rest of the Nation. 
   And the foreclosures have taken a toll on Ohio's neighborhoods and communities. Data that was provided by HUD showed that there is a direct correlation between the number of high-risk loans in a neighborhood and increase in the neighborhood's vacancy  rates. Cleveland has been especially hit hard. There are an estimated 10,000 vacant homes in the City of Cleveland. On one of Cleveland streets, 37 out of 123 homes are in the same stage of the foreclosure process, so they are in some stage of the foreclosure process. 
   The testimony we heard in Ohio only made me more certain in my belief that State, cities, and counties need help from the Federal Government to deal with the problems caused by abandoning foreclosed properties. And I could go on and on and on, but I was extremely moved; and on my way out there were some people there from east Cleveland who said that 40 percent of all of the homes in east Cleveland were in foreclosure. 
   And then I heard the story of Campbell where people owned their homes free and clear. They were not expensive homes, but they had been handed down. They were in the family. They were paid for, $40,000 homes, and the guys came in there, the best suede-shoed boys I call them, and increased the appraisals on those homes, ran those appraisals up to $150,000 or more and lent money. And people found themselves in a situation where they couldn't pay it back. People who thought, well, I could refinance this house, I can put on another room, I can put on a new roof. I can do these things. And they were told, ``Just sign on the dotted line. Don't worry about it. We can get you into this refinance. Even if it resets, we can take care of that.'' 
   But MARCY KAPTUR,  let me just say, people all over America are wondering what happened. Families have lost their homes, communities are being devastated, cities are using their precious general fund money and CDBG money trying to maintain these boarded-up and foreclosed properties. They have problems with the vacant properties being occupied sometimes by the homeless or gang members in some communities.     
   They have the thieves that are going in stripping out the copper. Weeds are growing up. There are dogs on the property, and so the neighborhoods are being driven down by the foreclosed properties, and the people who remain in the neighborhoods, who keep their properties up, are losing value, and that value is fast being lost on homes. And people are finding that their mortgages that they are paying far outweigh the real cost of that home now that the values have been driven down. 
   And so here we are in the Congress of the United States; what do we do? As you know, a number of ideas have come to the surface. BARNEY FRANK, who is the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, came up with another comprehensive bill, and in that bill they worked out an arrangement where the lenders, the bankers, would write down the property to 85 percent of value. 
   We've been working for months to strengthen the FHA, who found itself toothless when all these banks came into our cities with these fancy products that they had. They had what we call exotic products, the products with the teaser loan that says you need nothing or a little bit down, sign on the dotted line, 6 months from now, a year from now, it will reset, but don't worry, we'll refinance it. And people only find that they cannot refinance it and they're losing the homes. 
   And so we were supposed to come up with these bills and legislation to deal with it, and we find that the Senate side worked on this for quite some time. They agreed on some things. One of the things they agreed on was that they would indeed work with the lenders to write down the properties and have them refinanced by FHA which would now be strengthened, and this would keep people in their homes. 
   We don't know how all of that is going to work. We do know that if people get refinancing and they're able to stay in their homes, we hope that they're able to keep up on those payments because, if they don't, that debt will fall back on to the American taxpayer. And unless the FHA by way of its collection of certain kinds of rates are able to offset that, then that's another burden that we're going to have to be faced with. But it is a way by which we can begin to look at how we can perhaps give some help to the homeowner. 
   You know, I had a piece of legislation that was quite controversial because there was some people who did want to bail out the big boys, but they did not want to do anything for the little people and for the cities that are suffering. And my bill, as you know, is designed so that we have money that would go straight into those cities, working with nonprofits and others to grab those properties, rehabilitate those properties, put them back on the market for low- and moderate-income people to be able to afford. 
   Well, it got stuck for a while. I had $15 billion for the cities and the counties in that bill. It was scored at half that amount because 7.5 of that $15 billion was going to be in loans and 7.5 was going to be in grants.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Well, you're absolutely correct, and certainly, we had our supporters. But I want to thank the Ohio delegation for weighing in on this bill and giving support to it. We had all of our community groups and organizations all over the country working hard, making calls, talking to Senators, talking to Members, putting stuff in the newspapers about this bill because they see this bill, too, as hope for the neighborhoods and the communities. And it would stop the cities from having to spend their precious general fund moneys and CDBG moneys to try and maintain and keep up of these properties for God knows how long. 
   And so you are right. This will bring some measure of help, and we've got to keep working at this to find out how we can do more. 
   One of the things that we know, the regulators dropped the ball. The regulators should have seen these exotic products. They should have known about these ARMs. They should have known about these no-documentation loans. They should have known about these loans resetting with margins of 2 to 3 and 4 percent above the interest rate once the reset takes place. 
   Someone gets into a loan for 5, 6 percent, when it resets now they're 10, 11 percent, and people who are paying mortgages of $950, maybe even $1,000 a month, now they're told their mortgage is $3,000, $3,500. It is unconscionable. 
   And I see you have a picture up there of some of the giants of the banking industry. You know, Countrywide is a real poster child for what went wrong in this mortgage market. Mr. Mozilo really does have to take credit for having done extraordinary business with these mortgages. Mr. Mozilo is one of those bankers and one of those companies where he got the license as the broker, and then he hired people who didn't have a license, who didn't have any training, and put them out on the street, and they were all over the place. 
   Everywhere you look, every town hall you go into, where people are coming, begging us for help, and we ask them about where they got their loans, invariably Countrywide is going to show up all over this country. And so, you know, we have criticized him, and we have said how is it Mr. Mozilo can create this kind of devastation, walk away with millions of dollars that he's taken out of this company, and how is it that Bank of America could end up buying this company for pennies on the dollar and not be afraid that with somehow all of this portfolio of bad debt that they are going to make it? 
   Well, I think that they know more than we know. I think that they know  more than we know, and we've got to get smarter. We've got to have regulators who are prepared to do the job that they are supposed to do in protecting the American consumer from these rip-off artists and from these people who would steal their futures and steal the futures of their children with these rip-off products and the way that they design for everybody to make money along the way and leave that American homeowner not only holding the bag but with nothing at the end of this terrible situation. 
   So I want to thank you. We've got to put a lot of time in on this. We're going to get some legislation out. Of course, we're going to get some legislation, and as you know, with the GSEs now in trouble, Fannie and 
   Freddie, and the move to help them and to bail them out, to keep the whole economy from crashing on us, you better believe that we get a chance to get our little $4 billion in because it was put in on the Senate side. 
   But that's a drop in the bucket from what we're asking for and for what we need, but we must take this as a time when we never allow the American economy to be placed at risk because of a sub-prime crisis in the way that we are witnessing it now because we're going to be smarter. We're going to not only know what our regulators are supposed to be doing, we're going to provide the oversight for those regulators. We're going to unveil not only the schemes and the fancy products, but we want to know more about servicers, who they are and what they do. 
   Did you know that we have these banks with loss mitigation departments? Supposedly, if you're in trouble, you can call the bank and say I can't make my mortgage payment, I had a terrible illness and I had to pay out too much health money, and they're supposed to do kind of a workout with you to make sure they keep you in that home. Did you know that the people that they're talking to are offshore in India, in other countries, who are supposed to be responsible for loss mitigation activities for the banks? They have exported the loss mitigation departments offshore to foreigners who are talking to Americans about whether or not they can find a way for them to stay in their home.

   Ms. WATERS. If the gentlelady will yield for just a moment, wouldn't it be great to have community bankers in the community that you can talk to, people who hold your mortgage, that you can go and talk about what is happening, if you get in trouble, and they can work with you, but no, you know, they package all of these loans and securitize them. Wall Street invested in them, and the people can't get in touch with anybody. Now it's with a dispassionate servicer who has the ability to foreclose on your house, who could do a workout, but they make money. They make money by servicing and collecting the fees, the fees, the fees and more fees that's placed on top of these mortgages. 
   So I, too, yearn for the community banker.

   Ms. WATERS. We have not seen the final version of the bill, but today, in a discussion, one of the things that did interest me that I'm looking forward to seeing is that we are strengthening the oversight on the GSEs with OFHEO, the regulatory agency that has now been designed just to take care of these government enterprises. 
   But also what has been represented to us is that the investors will not be able to make any money off of this bailout; that GSEs, as you know, get input, they get money from investors and they go out to the market to get money. And so if we are going to allow them to go to the discount wonder at the Fed and to be invested in by Treasury Department, that we will be number one in line for the repayment. And the CEOs cannot get the big salaries that they have gotten in the past, that there will be a limit to what they will be able to do. 
   And so I'm looking to see the language in the bill that's going to make sure that we're first in line to get paid back, that the investors don't get paid dividends off of our money that we're putting in there, and that the CEOs and the top management of the GSEs don't get the fancy bonuses and the high salaries that they've been getting.

   Ms. WATERS. Thank you.  
   Wallets Open Up on Wall Street  
   Despite Wall Street's recent woes, people who work in the financial industry continue to dig deep for political donations to Republican and Democratic candidates for president. 
   Employees of Wall Street firms are the single largest source of campaign cash, accounting for a total of $50.4 million in financial contributions to the candidates so far this election cycle. That is more than any other industry sector, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of campaign-finance data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. 
   As candidates load up for advertising blitzes before ``Super Tuesday'' primaries on Feb. 5, candidates from both parties are again coming to New York seeking campaign donations. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, had a fund-raiser at the St. Regis Hotel last night that was hosted by Merrill Lynch & Co. Chief Executive John Thain, private-equity giant Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman John Whitehead. 
   Mr. McCain recently spent $1 million on advertising ahead of the Florida primary next Tuesday. Voters in more than 20 states, including California and New York, go to the polls Feb. 5. 
   New York Sen. Hillary Clinton heads to her home state tomorrow for two fund-raisers. The Clinton campaign hopes to raise $15 million through these and other means to fund her campaign through Feb. 5. 
   Contributions from Wall Street have favored Republicans, who have collected 54% of donations from financial companies. Wall Street is the No. 1 source of donations to every major presidential candidate in both parties, except former North Carolina Democratic Sen. John Edwards, who is favored by the legal industry, according to the data. 
   Lawyers and lobbyists are the second-largest source of contributions to the candidates, with $34.8 million in donations. Together, the finance and legal industries are responsible for nearly a quarter of the $354 million donated to the presidential candidates as of Sept. 30. The next round of campaign-finance information, covering the three-month period ending Dec. 31, will be released at the end of the month. 
   Employees of financial firms, lawyers and lobbyists make up 46% of all large donations--contributions of $200 or more--to the presidential candidates. Each of the other industry sectors is responsible for just a fraction of the donations to the candidates. 
   According to the data, people who work in Hollywood, communications or electronics rank a distant third with $13.3 million in donations to the candidates. Other top sources of donations were employees of the health-care industry with $9.5 million, construction with $6.1 million and energy with $3.1 million. People who work in the defense industry gave $502,000, according to the data. 
   Not surprisingly, the two candidates from New York are winning the race for donations on Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton and former New York City Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani lead with $12.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, in campaign donations from employees of Wall Street firms. 
   Employees of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley rank as the top individual sources of donations to the presidential candidates, according to the data. 
   Goldman employees were the largest contributor to Mr. Obama, the second-largest giver to Mrs. Clinton and the fifth-largest to Mr. Edwards. Goldman employees donated $369,000 to Mr. Obama and $350,000 to Mrs. Clinton. 
   Other top Wall Street givers to Mr. Obama include employees of Lehman Brothers ($229,000), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ($217,000) and Citigroup Inc. ($181,000). 
   The top seven companies that have produced the most money for Mr. Giuliani are all financial firms, including Ernst & Young LLP, hedge fund Elliott Management and Credit Suisse Group. 
   Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney also has fared well on Wall Street. A founder of Bain Capital, Mr. Romney has scored with employees of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Employees of his former company have donated $112,000 to his campaign, according to the data. 
   Unlike Wall Street, lawyers heavily favor Democrats with their political donations.  Lawyers have donated $9.6 million to Mrs. Clinton, $8.2 million to Mr. Edwards and $7.9 million to Mr. Obama. 
   Mr. Giuliani, a former prosecutor and partner with Bracewell & Giuliani LLP, raised $3.2 million from others in his profession. That was more than any other Republican but less than half as much as the leading Democratic candidates. 
   Pennsylvania-based law firm Blank Rome LLP was the top source of donations to Mr. McCain, who collected $141,000 from employees of the firm. Mr. McCain fared well with employees of Greenberg Traurig LLP, a Miami firm that ranks as his third-largest contributor. As the chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. McCain took the lead in investigating convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was a lobbyist with Greenberg Traurig. 
   Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton led all others with donations from lobbyists. Mrs. Clinton collected $568,000 from lobbyists, while Mr. McCain has $340,000.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (CHAIRWOMAN JUANITA MILLENDER-<b>MCDONALD </b> -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I come to the floor today to join with my colleagues in recognition of a public servant who served in this august body, who served in the California State legislature, who served the city of Compton as a city councilwoman, who served as head of the NAACP in the city of Compton, who was a community activist, a legislator and not only a committed servant but a woman who was determined to make sure that she did everything possible to bring about justice and equality, not only for our people but for all people. 
   I have known Juanita Millender-McDonald for over 35 years. I knew her before she was the president of the Compton chapter of the NAACP. She contacted me when she became the president and we worked on some projects together. We went on to work on many projects together. When my son ran for the California State legislature, she was involved with his campaign. When her son made an attempt to get back into professional football, my husband who was a professional football player, having played for the Cleveland Browns, helped to connect him with some recruiters in order to get him into professional football. And so we have interacted on a professional level, on a personal level and in so many ways for such a long period of time. 
   We have been involved in some of the same kind of issues over the years. I can recall, it was not so many years ago when it was revealed that perhaps our government had known about drugs that were being transported from Nicaragua into south central Los Angeles, and, of course, that revelation kicked off a firestorm in this country. Juanita McDonald invited the head of the CIA to come to south central Los Angeles to speak to the people and tell them what he knew about the Contras and about the Sandinistas and our involvement with the drug trade, this government. Did this government turn a blind eye while drugs were being transported across our borders? 
   It was an unusual event. Never had the head of the CIA been to a community to speak with the people, and people were everywhere. The FBI, the CIA, everybody was standing on roofs all over the place. It was a spectacular event. But that was her style. 
   Juanita McDonald and I not only worked on that issue in different ways. We have been involved in trying to save Martin Luther King Hospital for a number of years now. This has been a tough, tough battle. This hospital was born out of the ashes of the insurrection of 1965 in south Los Angeles. This is an institution that is so very much needed but is such at risk at this point. This institution has been threatened by the Federal Government to withdraw all of its Federal funds and we have fought day in and day out, month in and month out, year in and year out to maintain the funding from the Federal Government so that that hospital could stay there for people who need it so desperately. 
   Juanita McDonald has organized many meetings. She has interacted not only with CMS and the Federal Government but all of the county officials. Time after time we have sat before the board of supervisors, imploring them to do everything that they could to straighten out the problems at Martin Luther King Hospital, to work harder, to make sure there was the management and the supervision. 
   Juanita McDonald cared about health issues. Not only was she involved with trying to save Martin Luther King Hospital, she organized an AIDS walk that took place every year. She and her women's group organized and each year they went to one of the stadiums in the south Los Angeles area and they held their walk. It got a lot of attention, but this was her way of saying to the community, not only do I care about AIDS, I'm willing to put some quality time and attention on this issue. I want you to get tested. I want you to get involved in learning how you can protect yourself from being infected with HIV/AIDS. And so it is just a small example of the care and commitment that she has demonstrated over the years, whether we talk about health care or education or voting rights that she was so very much involved in before she took her leave of absence. 
   She cared about justice. She cared that this democracy would truly act in ways that supported the proposition that everybody has the right to a decent quality of life. Everybody must be protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. Everybody must enjoy the benefits of living in this great country. And she reached beyond with care for the mother continent of Africa. She was involved in those issues, also. 
   And so I stand here today to say, Juanita McDonald has taken her place in history and she did it her way. Sometimes we did it different ways, but she knew what she was doing and why she was doing it the way that she did. Her husband can be proud. Her children can be proud. And we can all be proud that we had the blessing and the opportunity to live and work with a woman of substance, a woman who cared, a woman who gave of herself and a woman who left us with dignity, a woman who never complained, a woman who never said, I feel bad, I have pain, I can't do it today. She worked right up until she took a leave of absence just a few days ago. 
   I am proud to stand here and say that I knew her, that I worked with her, that I have appreciated everything  that she has contributed to our great society.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (SUBPRIME LENDING -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for reserving this time tonight to bring to the attention of the American people our deep concern about subprime lending and the rising foreclosure rate across our Nation. 
   Last week, we learned that the foreclosure rate jumped 47 percent in March of 2007 from just 1 year ago. Several weeks ago, Freddie Mac, which buys loans from lenders and sets underwriting standards, stopped purchasing 2/28 and 3/27 loans, or loans on which interest rates are fixed for only the first 2 years or 3 years of a 30-year loan. 
   Freddie Mac, recognizing the increase in number of defaults on these exotic loans because of rising rates and falling real estate prices, cut its losses short and got out of the subprime business. 
   Within the last month, the Nation's second largest subprime lender, New Century Financial Corporation, suspended making any new subprime loans because of the huge number of defaults on subprime mortgage loans and has since filed for bankruptcy protection. Incidentally, the executives of First Century have asked for an exit package of some $6.5 million. 
   Countrywide, the largest subprime lender in the United States, also has problems with its subprime and prime portfolios. 
   Numerous subprime lenders have been forced into bankruptcy or have been sold to larger lenders. 
   General Motors Acceptance Corporation is out of the subprime business altogether. The list continues to grow with each passing day. 
   Defaults on subprime mortgage loans have prompted investors to turn their backs on mortgage-backed securities, making it more difficult for subprime lenders to sell their loans and to raise the cash for new loans. This has created a liquidity trap for many borrowers who want to refinance out of the nontraditional mortgage products. Huge amounts of cash that once sought the high yields tied to mortgage-backed securities creating easy money for borrowers, many of whom had less than stellar credit, or lacked loan documentation, or sought zero down payment products, is no longer available. No one knows for sure what the extent of the exposure is and exactly who is exposed because the way mortgages are packaged into pools and sold to investors makes it difficult to determine who owns the loans and how much money is lost. 
   One estimate by Lehman Brothers suggests that approximately $19 billion in losses are parked in loan pools put together in 2005, 2006 and this year, representing 5.5 percent of all mortgages. 
   The Center for Responsible Lending December 2006 report entitled, ``Losing Ground: Foreclosures in the Subprime Market and Their Cost to Homeowners,'' documents the relationship between subprime lending and foreclosures and suggests that by the end of 2006, 2.2 million households in the subprime market either will have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold subprime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 billion, primarily in home equity. 
   One out of five, or 20 percent, of the subprime mortgages originated during the first 2 years will end in foreclosure. So rather than wealth creation that we expect with homeownership, we will witness wealth evaporation tied to foreclosures. 
   Federal regulators issued guidance last year acknowledging that subprime loans were a problem. The guidance speaks to loans where the rates can change dramatically after the second or third year of the mortgage, such as from 7 percent to 11.5 percent. That guidance suggests that lenders be required to take into account the borrower's ability to make monthly payments at higher rates and also property taxes and homeowners insurance which are often not escrowed in the subprime loans. 
   I applaud the guidance, but what we really need is for there to be forbearance on the part of lenders while we get this mess straightened out and before it leads to something catastrophic in the financial markets. It has already spilled over into the home building industry, and the fallout is far from over. 
   Congress must still balance the interest of assisting home buyers who are low- and moderate-income first-time buyers, while ensuring that they avoid the pitfalls of the subprime market and that they have safe options. Providing assistance to existing subprime borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes is key. 
   I believe that FHA modernization is part of the solution, and so we will mark up H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007, a bill that I have introduced, next week in the Committee on Financial Services. Reasonable workout plans represent another mechanism that can assist homeowners from falling into foreclosure. 
   In effect, the lenders know that they are better off not losing these borrowers to foreclosure since it is very costly to the lenders. It only creates a ripple effect in the communities where the properties are located, creating vacancies, blight, arson and other social ills. In addition, the cycle of predatory lending activity continues with investors purchasing foreclosed property at depressed prices only to turn around and sell the properties quickly at inflated prices.  
   I have asked Freddie to take a look at prohibiting the use of its resources to finance this type of mortgage lending. 
   A big plus is that Freddie Mac just took proactive steps, announcing that it will make $20 billion available to assist borrowers by the summer with refinancing. Fannie Mae will join this effort. I can not predict what will happen in the subprime lending market, but I do believe that we can stem the tide of foreclosures by working closely with Freddie, Fannie and the lenders. One thing that I do know is that we will have to correct this problem if the markets can not fix it. We can not sit by and watch Americans, many through no fault of their own, lose their homes. Every time there is a victim to foreclosure, the rate of homeownership in American falls and the gap between the rich and the poor worsens. No one wants to reverse the progress that we have made in this country on homeownership, certainly not me.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (STRATEGY FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, last night the President reiterated his plans to send more troops to Iraq, despite bipartisan opposition in Congress and the opposition of most Americans. 
   Iraq is in a civil war. The violence that plagues Iraq is increasing, and our troops are caught in the middle of Iraqi sectarian violence. We have lost 3,032 of our brave men and women in this war. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, despite the fact that the President talks about his surge, or what we know it to be, an expansion, we have to remember, these are not new boots on the ground. These tours are being extended. These tours are being extended, and some of our men and women in the military are being asked to extend their tours two and three times. They are also shortening the length of time that these soldiers have at home. Many of them, who have been on two tours and expect to go home and spend a little time with their families, are being told, no, you won't be able to spend the time that you thought you were going to be able to spend. You have got to come back after having been home a shorter period of time. Even the National Guard. They are now eliminating the limitations on how many times they can be called up for Active Duty. So these are not new boots on the ground. 
   As the Iraq Study Group noted in its report, ``Attacks against U.S. coalition and Iraqi security forces are persistent and growing. Total attacks in October 2006 averaged 180 per day, up from 70 per day in January 2006. Daily attacks against Iraqi security forces in October were more than double the level in January. Attacks against civilians in October were four times higher than in January. Some 3,000 Iraqi civilians are killed every month.'' 
   The United Nations estimated that more than 34,000 civilians were violently killed across Iraq in 2006, with an average of 94 killed every day.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (HOUSING ASSISTANCE COUNCIL AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1980, the Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act of 2007. 
   This bill authorizes $10 million for the Housing Assistance Council, HAC, in Fiscal Year 2008 and $15 million in Fiscal Years 2009-2014. HAC, a nonprofit corporation, is the only national intermediary focused solely on the tremendous affordable housing needs of rural areas and small towns. 
   HAC assists in the development of both single-family homes and multi-family housing, and promotes homeownership for working low-income rural families. HAC maintains a special focus on high-need groups and regions: Indian country, the Mississippi Delta, farm workers, the Southwest border colonias, and Appalachia. In just the past 8 years, HAC has provided over $105 million in aid to hundreds of organizations in 160 Congressional districts. Since inception in 1971, HAC has helped build 60,000 affordable homes in 49 states and 2 territories. 
   The funds authorized by H.R. 1980 will allow HAC to continue successfully assisting a national network of rural nonprofit, public and for profit builders. Specifically, HAC could continue providing grants, loans, technical assistance, training, and other support to build the capacity of rural community-based housing development organizations to create and sustain safe affordable housing. The bill also enables HAC to offer vital help to specific housing projects and initiatives these groups undertake. 
   I am especially pleased that this funding will enable HAC to bring its expertise to bear on the problem of rural homelessness. While my District does not encompass rural areas, it does have as many as 10,000 persons on any given night. And though it may not seem so at first blush, homelessness in central Los Angeles is related to rural homelessness. 
   Specifically, in the absence of an adequately resourced network of housing and service providers in their home communities, poor rural folks who fall into homelessness often leave their family and social networks and move to larger urban areas in the hope of finding jobs, housing, and social services. 
   While migrating from the countryside to the city, and vice versa, is an important and time-honored American tradition, these vulnerable households--often with few skills and suffering from disabilities or chronic health problems--too often experience homelessness again in the destination city. There, they enter public and private systems of care already stressed to the breaking point--as tragically exemplified by a recent ``60 Minutes'' story on so-called ``hospital patient-dumping'' in Los Angeles. 
   H.R. 1980 will enable HAC to help interrupt this tragic cycle, by building the capacity of their network of housing developers and social service providers to care for the homeless and at-risk in their own hometowns--where they are most likely to escape homelessness and re-enter the economic mainstream.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1982, the Rural Housing and Economic Development Improvement Act of 2007. This bill authorizes $30 million for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's, HUD, Rural Housing and Economic Development, RHED, program in FY 2008 and $40 million for Fiscal Years 2009-2013. 
   Although Congress has funded RHED since 1999, this bill finally gives the program formal authorization. Such authorization is long overdue, as this competitive grant program has long-since proven its worthiness. According to the Office of Management and Budget, RHED grants have created more than 9,100 jobs and more than 112,000 housing units. 
   RHED grants are desperately needed to address the growing affordable housing crisis in rural America. While housing costs are lower in rural America, so too are household incomes. As a result, rural America faces a growing affordability concern, particularly among renters. According to the 2005 American Housing Survey, nearly 3.6 million rural households are cost burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their monthly income for housing costs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's biennial ``worst case housing needs'' survey reveals that, in 2005, nearly 1 million rural households paid more than half their incomes in housing costs and/or lived in substandard housing--a dramatic 51 percent increase since 2003. 
   RHED funding is prudently allocated--based on community need measured by poverty and unemployment rates, as well as by other indicators including rates of substandard housing and percentage of households facing affordability problems. 
   The RHED program also emphasizes specific high needs regions and populations. Over 60 percent of the organizations that have received RHED funds over the program's history serve high needs regions, which include Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the Border Colonias, Native American lands, and farmworkers. 
   The RHED program also targets smallest, most isolated rural communities, giving extra weight to applications proposing to serve areas with populations of 2,500 or less. Because of this targeting, the Housing Assistance Council estimates that almost one-third of RHED grants have been allocated to organizations serving the most remote rural counties. 
   RHED is an especially important housing resource for rural America because of its exclusive focus on rural communities--a unique niche among HUD programs, and one that helps redress the challenges rural communities face in obtaining funding in many other federal housing programs. For example, only 12 percent of section 8 funds go to non-metropolitan areas and the HOME program has no set-aide for rural communities, with the result that they receive a disproportionately small portion of formula grants. Less than 7 percent of FHA assistance goes to non-metropolitan areas. On a per-capita basis, rural counties fare worse with FHA, getting only $25 per capita versus $264 per capita in metro areas. Only about 10 percent of Veterans Affairs housing programs reach non-metropolitan areas and per capita spending in rural counties is only one-third that of metropolitan areas. 
   RHED fills such critical gaps left by other Federal housing and community development programs. Its flexible design supports comprehensive community development efforts that address the interconnected housing and economic development needs of rural communities. This targeted resource has enabled rural community organizations across the country to design and implement innovative programs and stabilize their communities. The ongoing need for the RHED programs is clear and I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1982, the Rural Housing and Economic Development Improvement Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 644, the Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act, a bill of which I am an original cosponsor. I certainly applaud the distinguished chairman of Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Frank, for working to get this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Mr. Gary Miller, who introduced the bill and who has been working on this subject for quite some time, as well as all of the other cosponsors of this bill. 
   The House passed a bill identical to H.R. 644 in the 109th Congress because many of us recognized the importance of preserving a means of remedying the numerous hazardous sites that remain in this country. 
   Under the Brownfields Act, the Environmental Protection Agency awards grants for the assessment and cleanup of sites that pose a serious threat to human health and the environment than sites addressed by the Superfund. 
   Many of these sites thwart the development and revitalization of communities in distressed areas of the country, including the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. In fact, it is these sites that make development efforts impossible because of the potential risks. 
   The Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act becomes a powerful economic development tool when used in conjunction with other Federal economic redevelopment resources, CDBG and section 108 loan guarantees. It is precisely the kind of leveraging tool that we must utilize to spur development in places where development costs are uncertain given the presence of hazardous materials. 
   The Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act, if passed, will continue to provide four types of competitive grants: Assessment grants used as planning tools by grantees to conduct due diligence related to the affected sites; revolving loan fund grants to capitalize the loans for the cleanup of the sites; cleanup grants that provide for the recipient to undertake cleanup activities; and job training grants made available to nonprofits and educational entities to develop environmental job training programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to postpone passage of this bill any longer. It sends a bad signal to the communities across the Nation who are trying to rebuild, reinvest and strengthen their economic local economies. Any Federal tool to leverage private investment must be preserved, particularly in this pay-as-you-go economic environment. The Brownfields Enhancement Act is a tool, and therefore I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Reassessing complex and outdated accounting standards; improving the understandability, consistency, and overall usability of the existing accounting and auditing literature; developing principles-based accounting standards; encouraging the use and acceptance of interactive data; and promoting disclosures in plain English. 
   In view of the different accounting standards being used in the private sector and government, it is clear that we need to have information that is reliable and credible. Financial information that does not meet rigorous and acceptable standards sends the wrong signals to investors as well as to the public about the real the financial condition of a business. 
   As we have witnessed over the past several years, the quality of financial information can make the difference between the true value of a company and what the public perceives to be its condition. H.R. 755 is an important first step towards making sure that the information being reported to investors and to the public is believable. As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you and Mel Watt, Mr. Bachus and Mr. Miller and others who have worked so hard on this bill. It is a very complicated issue. You have done a spectacular job. 
   I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Act of 2007. Each month brings figures, new figures, that reinforce the importance of putting in place a Federal legislative and regulatory framework that prevents us from reliving this crisis in the mortgage markets. I have a keen interest in this legislation because of the disproportionate impact of the foreclosure wave on my home State. California's third quarter foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for every 88 households ranked second highest in all States and reflects a near quadrupling of the number reported for the same period last year. Five of the top 10 metropolitan areas in foreclosure filings are in California. 
   Clearly, we need to prevent the now widespread practice of getting people into loans they simply can't afford. H.R. 3915 takes critical steps in this respect, including, for the first time, imposing a Federal duty of care on all mortgage originators and setting minimum Federal standards on all mortgages. Anchoring the bill's approach are newly established minimum standards regarding the borrower's ability to repay and net tangible benefit to the consumer. This is a sound strategy given that federally regulated mortgage originators have long had to meet similar benchmarks, and not coincidentally, we have seen few problems in that sector of the market. 
   H.R. 3915 also seeks to reduce the incentives to market inappropriate credit products to borrowers. I am particularly pleased that H.R. 3915, again for the first time, removes the most destructive of such incentives, severing the link between the compensation of the originator and the terms of the loan. Minority borrowers have been disproportionately steered to costly loans, in part because the fees such loans generate for originators are higher than more appropriate products. H.R. 3915 correctly prohibits this practice outright. 
   I am proud to have been an operational cosponsor of this very ambitious legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this passage today. However, I would not be telling the truth if I said I lacked any concerns about the potential impact of our ambition over time. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to thank you, Ranking Member Bachus, Mr. Watt and others for your diligent work in the manager's amendment to address one such concern that I raised during the Financial Services Committee markup of the bill, namely, the extent to which the assignee liability and remedies this bill creates should preempt State law.     
   We want to make sure that consumers are protected to the greatest extent possible. Historically, many of these protections have been initiated by States, especially in the subprime market. 
   With that, I would like to conclude. I would like to be clear that this groundbreaking bill should be passed today, and I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3915.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. Each month brings new figures that reinforce the importance of putting in place a Federal legislative and regulatory framework that prevents us from reliving this crisis in the mortgage markets. I have a keen interest in this legislation because of the disproportionate impact of the foreclosure wave on my home State.

I am particularly pleased that H.R. 3915--again for the first time--removes the most destructive of such incentives, severing the link between the compensation of the originator and the terms of the loan. Minority borrowers have been disproportionately steered to costly loans, in part because the fees such loans generate for originators are higher than more appropriate products. H.R. 3915 correctly prohibits this practice outright. 
   I am proud to have been an original co-sponsor of this ambitious legislation, and urge my colleagues to support its passage today.  But I would not be telling the truth if I said I lacked any concerns about the potential 
   impact of our ambition over time. Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank you and Ranking Member BACHUS for your diligent work in the Manager's Amendment to address one such concern I raised during the Financial Services Committee markup of the bill, namely, the extent to which the assignee liability and remedies this bill creates should preempt State law. We want to make sure that consumers are protected to the greatest extent possible--and, historically, many of these protections have been initiated by States, especially in the sub-prime market. But we also don't want to shut down the secondary mortgage market that has critical to expanding homeownership nationally. 
   I appreciate the effort that the Manager's Amendment makes to better strike this delicate balance. The Manager's Amendment now clarifies that the bill does not preempt state laws such as fraud and civil rights statutes. In particular, I appreciate that the Manager's Amendment makes crystal clear that securitizers will be held to account when they directly participate in a fraud--as in the egregious First Alliance case I mentioned at Committee markup. However, attorneys who have been working on predatory lending issues in my district and State for decades, continue to be concerned that the legal meaning of this provision is unclear. As such, federal courts may impart this meaning in ways that roll back important consumer remedies under State law. 
   This, in turn, raises the question of whether we have yet reached the right balance of Federal rights and remedies in the bill, given that we may be displacing a lot of State and private activity in this financial sector. Certainly, national organizations representing consumers remain concerned about this, and many have declined to endorse the bill. As you have noted, Mr. Chairman, that industry groups seem equally ambivalent about the bill suggests that perhaps we are approaching the proper ``unhappiness quotient'' among the stakeholders. As this bill moves to the Senate and to conference, though, I urge that continue to take seriously and re-examine issues surrounding preemption and strength of remedies. 
   To conclude, however, I want to be clear that I believe this groundbreaking bill should be passed today. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3915. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for all of your work on this bill.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was a remarkably committed legislator. As the first African-American woman to chair a full committee in Congress, she was deeply dedicated to the work of the House Administration Committee. Through her chair, she was working on landmark legislation to ensure the integrity of our voting system. 
   At home, Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD worked every day for her constituents on the issues of healthcare, economic development and housing. Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD was engaged in a serious effort to revitalize the public housing in her district and was involved in a series of tours and meetings with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Alphonso Jackson, at both Imperial Courts and Nickerson Gardens aimed at providing better housing options for her constituents. 
   Recently, we joined together to lend our voices to the chorus of community leaders and residents in a successful effort to extend funding for Martin Luther King Hospital. 
   Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be missed not only by her constituents in the 37th district, but by all of the people who were touched by her service.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I would like to commend those who have worked so hard for so long to try and right the wrong of our occupation in Iraq. I would like to thank the leadership for all the attempts that they have made to try and engage people on the opposite side of the aisle and those who don't have enough courage to do the right thing. 
   We find ourselves here at a moment with an omnibus bill that we have had to support, and many people have many things in the bill that they would like to have back home. I understand that. But in the final analysis, we are never going to end this war until we stop feeding this war with the taxpayers' dollars after they have told us to bring our soldiers home. 
   I stand here today in support of our soldiers. I support them coming home. Young men and women are dying in Iraq, the victims of IEDs, not even knowing how to protect themselves. And they come home, and we have to struggle to make sure that they are taken care of, that their health care needs are met. 
   When are we going to come to our senses? We are fighting a war that we never should have been in in the first place. We are fighting a war where we  were told there were weapons of mass destruction and there were none. We are fighting a war where we have contractors who are abusing civilians in Iraq. We have contractors who are stealing the taxpayers' money in Iraq. And yet we continue to nuance this debacle. We continue to say, I didn't understand. I didn't know. Well, let me make it perfectly clear. 
   There is $70 billion in this bill for Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is fungible. We don't know how much of it is going to be spent where. But don't go away saying, I didn't understand, I didn't know, that is not what I intended to do. There is $70 billion here. If you don't want to continue this war, don't vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Mr. Scott for the tremendous effort that he has put forward to help develop this CBC alternative budget. 
   We have before us perhaps the most important piece of legislation that we will vote on all year; the budget resolution that sets forth the priorities this House will pursue for the remainder of the year. 
   I am very pleased to join with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to present an alternative budget, a budget that is wise, prudent, responsible and balanced. I have many concerns, deep concerns with health care, education, criminal justice elements of the resolution. But I think I want to focus my time on housing and community development, given my position as the chair of the subcommittee that bears that name. 
   We have all witnessed the instability of our economy in the face of turmoil directly resulting from the housing and mortgage market. Incredibly, at a time when we should be focusing more resources on this area, the President's budget slashes programs that provide housing and supportive services to our country's poorest disabled and elderly households. It starves the local housing authorities of funds they need to sustain and modernize public housing stock, and once again seeks to cripple the Community Development Block Grant program. 
   Specifically, the President's budget reduces funding for HUD 202 supportive housing for the elderly by 27 percent. If enacted, this cut would leave funding for this program at a level 40 percent below its fiscal year 2001 appropriations. The CBC adds $300 million to the President's request to rectify this cut. 
   There are a number of other cuts, but let me draw your attention to the proposed elimination of the HOPE VI program, which the House of Representatives recently voted to reauthorize on a bipartisan vote of 271-130. The CBC budget adds $1 billion to restore this program. 
   Let me also bring to your attention a cut in the Community Development Block Grant program of $657 million and a zeroing out of the section 108 Loan Guarantee program. If enacted, the President's budget would culminate a multi-year attack on CDBG that could put the program at a funding level of about one-half of its appropriation in fiscal year 2001. 
   I ask support of the CBC budget. I believe that all of America would be served well by this budget.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY for their leadership on the Progressive Caucus for all of the work that they do, not only putting this alternative budget together, but the leadership they have provided to this Congress and trying to get this Congress moving in the right direction and representing all of the people. 
   I certainly did not want to take my time responding to the gentleman from Wisconsin, but we need to understand the definitions. When he talks about raising taxes, what he's really talking about is the fact that both of these budgets, the Congressional Black Caucus budget and the Progressive Caucus budget simply will eliminate the tax giveaways to the richest corporations in America. And that's what he calls raising taxes, the very people who are responsible for getting us in this sub-prime mess that we are in now where we have people who are losing their homes to foreclosures. 
   Having said all of that, I have already spoken about my support for the Congressional Black Caucus. And I'm offering today my very, very strong support for the Progressive Caucus budget. 
   Many of the priorities are the same in these two budgets, including vastly increasing funds for housing and community development, veterans education, health programs, and energy independence. I strongly support these increases. 
   As I said, when I talked about the Congressional Black Caucus budget, they had eliminated HOPE VI, a program that would provide decent housing for the most vulnerable people in our society in a responsible way. They tried to reduce the CDBG program, the program that goes to these small cities and to these towns that are using them for infrastructure and helping senior citizens and youth. And this budget would put the money back in to make them continue to be credible programs. 
   Let me talk a little bit about the economic stimulus. The components of the economic stimulus package included in the Progressive Caucus budget, for which we have been advocating for many weeks now, are certainly needed to help those Americans hardest hit by the worsening economic situation. 
   Most importantly, stimulation will come from increased funds for housing assistance and community development. The economic downturn came from the devastating housing market, and that is where we need to focus our resources. 
   The Progressive Caucus also targets unemployment, insurance, food stamps, FMAP and health care aid and large infrastructure projects in each of our States to invest in our cities and create new jobs. With well-founded fears of a recession being discussed at dinner tables across the country, these investments are absolutely necessary to support our constituents and stimulate our economy. 
   The Progressive Caucus also focuses on cutting the fat from our bloated Pentagon budget. Our military is still preparing to fight the Cold War against the USSR. I won't go any further than that. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for the time, and I'd like to express my support for the Progressive Caucus.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, according to the World Bank, more than 10 million children in developing countries die every year before the age of 5, most from preventable illnesses. More than 1 billion people in developing countries do not have access to save drinking water. And approximately 100 million school-age children do not attend school. 
   In sub-Saharan Africa, 41 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day. 
   It was because of these injustices that I first got involved in the issue of debt relief, and I would like to thank many of my colleagues who have been working with me over the years on debt relief and who have joined with me to present this legislation. 
   First, I'd like to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK, who's always been a big supporter and a fighter, and who's worked very hard in the past to ensure that we are on record doing the right thing for poor children and poor families all over the world. 
   And of course I've been very pleased to work with the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. SPENCER BACHUS, who worked with me on Jubilee 2000, and who's been involved in debt relief for many, many years. 
   I'd like to thank the original cosponsors, Mr. Emanuel Cleaver, Mr. LUIS GUTIERREZ, Ms. CAROLYN MALONEY, Mr. DONALD PAYNE, Ms. BARBARA LEE, and others such as Ms. JUDY BIGGERT, who serves on our Financial Services Committee, and Ms. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, who is the Ranking Member on Foreign Affairs, for all of the work and the assistance and the cosponsorship for this legislation.     
   In 1999, I worked with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee to pass legislation to provide debt relief to the world's poorest countries. Our legislation provided complete debt cancellation for the bilateral debt that certain poor countries owed to the United States. Several other donor countries followed our example and cancelled the debts that were owed to them as well. 
   Our legislation also directed the Clinton administration to negotiate with other world leaders to significantly reduce poor countries' multilateral debts. The following year, the House passed my amendment to the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which increased funding for debt relief from $69 million to $225 million. This amendment proved that Congress supported full funding for the debt relief programs. 
   Since then, we have continued to work together in a bipartisan way to urge not only the Clinton administration but the Bush administration as well, the IMF, the World Bank, and other multilateral financial institutions to expand debt relief. As a result of our efforts, 23 heavily indebted poor countries have received complete cancellation of their debts. 
   Debt cancellation has proven to be effective in freeing up resources for poverty reduction. Cameroon is using its savings of $29.8 million from debt cancellation in 2006 for national poverty reduction priorities including infrastructure, social sector, and governance reforms. Uganda is using its savings of $57.9 million to improve energy infrastructure, to ease acute electricity shortages, as well as primary education, malaria control, health care, and water infrastructure. Zambia is using its savings of $23.8 million to increase spending on agricultural projects and to eliminate fees for health care in rural areas. 
   I'm proud to report that debt relief has made a real difference in the lives of millions of impoverished people. This came to pass because our country showed leadership, and our country showed leadership because this Congress showed leadership. 
   We are here today to continue our efforts. We are here today to enable additional needy and deserving poor countries to benefit from the cancellation of their debts. The Jubilee Act would make up to an additional 25 low-income countries eligible for debt relief, provided these countries meet strict criteria and use the savings for poverty reduction programs such as improvements to economic infrastructure, basic education, nutrition and health services, and programs to redress environmental degradation. 
   I would like to share with you a few of the observations and perhaps comments that I have learned about since I have been involved with debt cancellation. 
   Julius Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania, once asked, ``Must we starve our children to pay our debts?'' For Tanzania, the answer to this question is, ``not anymore.'' That is because Tanzania is one of the lucky ones. It is one of the 23 countries that have already received complete debt cancellation. Tragically, many other countries are still starving their children in order to pay their debts. 
   Debt forgiveness is a moral imperative, and it is encouraged by many religious traditions. The Bible instructs the people of ancient Israel to cancel debts periodically through the celebration of a sabbath year every 7 years and a jubilee every 50 years. 
   Leviticus 25:10 says, ``Proclaim liberty throughout the lands and to all the inhabitants thereof. It shall be a jubilee for you.'' 
   Let us once again proclaim a jubilee for millions of people in some of the poorest countries in the world. 
   I would ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this Jubilee Act. 
   Before yielding the balance of my time, I would like to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for urging us to get this bill up and get it on the floor so that we could go on record in support of debt cancellations for the poor countries of the world. 
   At this time, I would like to yield the balance of my time to Chairman Frank, and I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to control the time.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 94, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of the Ninth Annual National Consumer Protection Week to highlight the importance of consumer protection, and I thank the Gentleman from Texas (Mr. HINOJOSA) for introducing it. 
   This resolution is important because it calls on governmental officials, industry leaders, schools, nonprofit organizations, and consumer advocates to provide citizens with valuable information and because it encourages the American people to utilize consumer protection information that is made available to them. 
   I hope that this message resonates in my home State of California because our students are in the midst of a consumer crisis. Unless the State acts expeditiously, the consumer protection statute and the agency responsible for protecting postsecondary students from fraudulent institutions whose misrepresentations cause them to default on tens of thousands of dollars in Federal student loans will expire on June 30, 2007. The statute set to expire is called the Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education Act and it authorizes a regulatory and enforcement bureau to scrutinize institutions that receive Federal higher education funds. 
   In the 1980s and 1990s, numerous abuses by unlawful institutions cost taxpayers billions of dollars in defaulted student loan debt--in fact, there was $3.2 billion in defaulted student loans in 1992 alone. More recently, in August and October 2006, two San Diego trade schools closed without notice to its students, setting 400 to 800 of them on the path to default on Federal and private student loans--many totaling $20,000 or more per student--with no education to justify it. 
   I hope that the State of California sees passage of this important resolution as Congress' call to take whatever measures necessary to uphold the consumer rights of the American people and works quickly to reauthorize the Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education Act. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York for bringing this resolution before this House. His work is very important on this issue. 
   And I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 35, supporting the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. 
   The first annual National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day was organized on February 23, 2001, with the message ``Get Educated, Get Involved, Get Tested.'' 
   Unfortunately, African Americans have been gravely impacted by the AIDS epidemic. Unfortunately, African Americans account for half of the new AIDS cases, although we are only 13 percent of the population. Worse yet is the fact that African American women represent 67 percent of new AIDS cases among women, and black teenagers represent 66 percent of new AIDS cases among teenagers. 
   That is why back in 1998 I established the Minority AIDS Initiative, with the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Clinton administration. At that time we received $166 million in funding the new initiative, and this initiative for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs serving African American and other minority communities was very helpful in helping to build capacity in these communities to deal with the problem. 
   However, it is not enough. Last year I asked for $610 million, and I am renewing my call with the support of the Congressional Black Caucus for that amount. But the message ``Get Educated, Get Involved, Get Tested'' is an important message for all Americans. Over 1 million Americans are living with HIV/AIDS, and 24 to 27 percent of them do not know they are infected. 
   That is why today I am reintroducing the Routine HIV/AIDS Screening Coverage Act. This bill requires health insurance plans to cover routine HIV/AIDS tests under the same terms and conditions as other routine health screenings. 
   I also plan to reintroduce the Stop AIDS in Prison Act, a bill to require routine HIV/AIDS screening of all Federal prison inmates upon entering prison and again prior to release from prison, as well as comprehensive treatment for those who test positive. Routine HIV/AIDS screening will allow thousands of African Americans and other infected individuals to find out about their infection, begin life-extending treatment, and avoid spreading the virus to others. 
   I urge my colleagues to support National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, and I urge all Americans to educate themselves, act responsibly, get involved, and get tested for HIV/AIDS. 
   I thank Representative Towns for the attention that he has given to this issue.

   Do you believe that it would be helpful if we took this resolution and made a comprehensive effort, focused effort, to get to the churches and to some of the other institutions that are so important in our community, disseminate it widely so that we could broaden the individuals and groups who are involved in this whole discussion and fight against HIV and AIDS?

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, Members, I would like to commend all of our authors and co-authors on this legislation. We learned a lot because of Hurricane Katrina. We learned that FEMA and HUD are confused. They don't work together. As a matter of fact, they work against each other. And the most vulnerable of those who were victimized by Hurricane Katrina, the public housing residents, were so negatively impacted by all of this. 
   We found that when there was a subcommittee hearing that we held, this joint hearing with Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency, Communications, Preparedness, and Response, we talked about the roles of HUD and FEMA in responding to affordable housing needs following natural disasters and emergencies. At that hearing, we learned that HUD Section 9 program, the public housing reconstruction, has never been funded because of language in appropriations acts that has barred the program from receiving any appropriations. Although HUD has been providing a limited amount of funds from its already underfunded capital fund this year, the department proposes not to provide any emergency capital funds. 
   In addition, because section 9(k) is authorized, FEMA has refused to allow PHAs to access funds under its section 406 reconstruction program. This is in spite of the fact that there is no statutory or other prohibition on PHAs using these funds. FEMA is simply refusing to grant PHAs access to section 406 funding because it says that PHAs have another source for this purpose, section 9(k), which has never been funded. 
   You've heard a lot from Members here today about this, and I'm going to yield back my time so that the gentleman can do a close appropriate to this legislation that he so courageously authored. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Childers).

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago, Thomas Friedman wrote an op ed in the New York Times titled, ``Remember Iraq.'' 
   In the article, Mr. Friedman laments that in the last couple of months ``the air has gone out of the Iraq debate.'' Mr. Friedman, unfortunately, seems to be correct. We haven't been talking about Iraq as much lately. 
   The media is partly to blame for this, but the consumers of the media take some responsibility as well. Without new sensational stories to run, war coverage becomes monotonous, and we can be desensitized to the depictions of war. But it is the media's ethical responsibility to focus on the issues that matter the most rather than what sells the most papers and boosts ratings. 
   When reports of the terrible toll of the Iraq war fall off the front page and disappear from nightly TV coverage, it can be easier to put the sacrifices our men and women in uniform are making in Iraq out of one's mind. It can be easy to forget the suffering of the Iraq people, whose lives continue to be plagued by violence. The enormous costs of the war don't seem as real when they are not thrust in our faces every day. 
   But it is also the ethical responsibility of this Congress to continue to debate an issue as important as the war. We are partly to blame for letting the air out of the Iraq debate as well. 
   In the absence of the required number of votes needed to override an inevitable Bush veto on any Iraq-related legislation, we in Congress must do a better job of challenging the administration's false rhetoric about the Iraq war. While the war in Iraq is disappearing from the newspapers, problems in Pakistan, Turkey and Iran are sure getting a lot of attention. 
   Why aren't we making the connection between the problems in these countries with the problems we have created in Iraq? An enduring foreign military presence will destabilize any region. An enormous endless American military presence in the heart of the Middle East is a recipe for disaster. 
   We in Congress need to do more to educate our constituents of the incredible costs of this misguided war in Iraq and the danger it presents to the peace and security of the entire region. 
   The Middle East is a house of cards, and we are shaking the table. It is no accident that since we began our misguided war in Iraq, we have seen more problems among Iraq's neighbors. Turkey is a very important ally to the United States, and the threat of a Turkish invasion into the Kurdish region of Iraq is a real problem for us. The last thing we need is another front opening in an already unmanageable war. 
   We must also discuss the connection between the President's so-called war on terror, with the problems we are watching unfold in Pakistan. We must not forget that the al Qaeda forces, who might long ago have been defeated if we hadn't been distracted in Iraq, have invaded northern Pakistan and hundreds of Pakistani soldiers have been killed. Most experts agree that Osama bin Laden is probably hiding in that region in northern Pakistan. 
   Meanwhile, General Musharraf has imposed a state of emergency through Pakistan dissolving the courts and suspending the constitution. Thousands of angry lawyers in Lahore and other cities Monday have taken to the streets to protest the embattled Pakistani President. Pictures in our newspapers of the lawyers being beaten and arrested by the police are ominous warnings of further trouble to come. 
   This is worrisome when it happens in any country, but down right terrifying when it happens in a country that possesses nuclear weapons. It is difficult for anyone to say exactly how this connects to our failed war in Iraq, but it surely isn't helping. 
   The point is that President Bush's irresponsible policy in the Middle East has destabilized the entire region. He has created a ticking time bomb. Rather than trying to defuse the situation with the diplomatic surge, Bush's answer was a military surge and to ratchet up the rhetoric against those who dare oppose him. 
   We must make it clear every single day that it is because we care so strongly about the safety of our country, the wellness of our military and the help of those who serve, that we demand an end to the war in Iraq. As Mr. Friedman pointed out, when we, as a country, allowed the debate over Iraq to fizzle, we are not merely procrastinating and delaying the eventual confrontation. We are committing negligence. 
   The daily cost of the war is staggering and cannot be ignored. For every day the war in Iraq continues, more American lives are lost, more Iraqis are killed, more of our tax dollars are spent, and political reconciliation in Iraq becomes less and less likely as the vital struggle for power continues to rage. Perhaps the most important measure of progress, the stability of the region, seems to be slipping further and further out of balance. 
   Countless proposals have been offered to change the course of this President's war in Iraq. There is no shortage of good ideas on how, when, and why we need to end the war in Iraq. I am of the opinion that we must end the war in Iraq as soon as possible and only provide funding to bring our troops home safely and quickly. 
   Others in the Democratic Caucus offer different answers but remain committed to the ultimate goal of ending the war. We demand a new direction. Let's bring our troops home to their families as soon as possible and refocus this country's resources on the issues that matter the most to the American people. It's time to end the war in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3524, the HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2007. As you know, I introduced H.R. 3524 on September 11 of 2007. 
   I want to thank each of my colleagues both on the Committee on Financial Services and in the House who have joined with me to see that this important legislation passes the House. I want to especially thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK, MELVIN WATT, and CHRISTOPHER SHAYS for their original coauthorship, cosponsorship, and support of H.R. 3524. 
   In drafting this bill, we worked closely with the minority, resident organizations, housing advocacy groups, public housing agencies, housing developers, bankers, green building experts, and practitioners, and other Members with an interest in the HOPE VI program. The end result is a bill that I believe takes into account the needs of residents, the community, the investors and lenders, and our public housing managers. Most importantly, we have a bill that preserves and revitalizes our public housing stock. 
   H.R. 3524 reauthorizes and improves the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program by requiring the one-for-one replacement of all demolished public housing units, providing residents with meaningful and substantive involvement in the planning and development of the HOPE VI plan, expanding community and supportive services from 15 percent of grants that amount to 25 percent of grant amount; prohibiting HOPE VI specific screening criteria so that public housing residents and HOPE VI aren't held to a higher standard than non-HOPE VI residents, requiring housing agencies to monitor and track the whereabouts of relocated families, and mandating that developments be built in accordance with green building standards. 
   Public housing residents, including those not yet impacted by HOPE VI, and housing advocates have said that this bill has been a long time in coming, and I agree with them. I would like to note why the bill before us today is so important. 
   First, it preserves public housing. The administration eliminated the one-for-one replacement requirement in 1996, effectively triggering a national sloughing off of our Nation's public housing inventory. 
   Housing authorities have consistently built back fewer units than they have torn down and, as a result, over 30,000 units have been lost as a direct result of the HOPE VI program. Stopping this bleeding was paramount in the drafting of this legislation. One-for-one replacement is not only a part of the bill; it is the heart of this bill. Limiting one-for-one to only occupied units does a disservice to families on waiting lists and to families waiting to get on waiting lists. Public housing is a community resource, and units can be unoccupied because they are not fit for humans to live in. That does not mean that there is no need for them. 
   Second, because of strict screening criteria, HOPE VI has become limited to the cream of the public housing crop. Some people think that the HOPE VI development represents a new and better community and should have new and better people. However, as a Congress, we must be clear that public housing is for the most in need, not just the easiest to serve.

   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Barney Frank, and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Mel Watt for their strong support of the manager's amendment to H.R. 3524. 
   In the manager's amendment filed before this committee, we worked very hard to address concerns that had been raised by the minority, housing advocates, resident organizations, housing authorities, and others to ensure that we have a bill that is achievable and responsive to the needs of low-income families and communities. 
   In the manager's amendment we maintain more of our public housing stock by requiring the replacement of any units in existence as of January 1, 2005; provide an extremely limited waiver of the one-for-one requirement in special circumstances, such as a court decree or a severe shortage of land, and impose a penalty on those housing authorities who receive a waiver but fail to meet their obligations under it; allow replacement units to be built outside the jurisdiction of the housing authority in the event the housing authority's jurisdiction is limited in the number of low-poverty areas; extend the timeline for rebuilding from 12 to 54 months; increase resident involvement in decisions surrounding significant changes to HOPE VI plans; exclude green building from total development costs; provide flexibility in nonresidential green development standards; protect grantees affected by cost increases and project delays as a result of the 2005 hurricanes from recapture of their funds; and provide that HOPE VI housing assistance is only for persons who are legally present in the United States. 
   These changes will greatly improve the bill and build upon the success of the HOPE VI program. Since this program's inception in 1992, we have all watched it at work in our districts and wondered how it could work better. We have all seen families displaced and heard stories about families disappearing into thin air because of these developments. We have seen the units come down and seen a reduced number come back up. We know that HOPE VI can and must do better. 
   This manager's amendment as well as the underlying bill will go far into making this a program that truly gives hope to low-income families. I urge you to support the manager's amendment and the underlying bill and to remember that this bill is about maintaining housing for our low-income families. They need our support. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank all of the people that I have identified on this side of the aisle today, plus people I have not identified on the opposite side of the aisle. It has been very enjoyable working with Mrs. Capito, I have appreciated the work of Mr. Shays, and of course my old friend, Mr. Bachus, even though we disagree on some things; and Mr. Neugebauer. We have all come to the conclusion certainly that HOPE VI is a valuable program and that all of our communities can benefit from it. 
   We have a few different views about one-for-one, we have a few different views about Davis-Bacon maybe, the destruction of units, and the green requirements. But this is one bill that both sides of the aisle understand very thoroughly that America is going to benefit. Mr. Bachus reminded us, even though I know that he understands, that the reason for HOPE VI is to deal with those public housing projects, those developments that were in great disrepair, that needed to be replaced, that needed to be restored, and not just the physical makeup, not just the buildings; but we also understood that what was wrong with our public housing developments was lack of services. 
   Many of these developments are like little towns, little cities without services. We all know and appreciate they need after-school, they need health care, they need all kinds of support for families, and job development. All of those things we all support, and I would not challenge my Members on the opposite side of the aisle on any of those issues.  
   I would like to thank them for the tremendous cooperation they have given, and the staffs have worked so well together to resolve a lot of questions to get us to the point that we are today; and while we will go through a few amendments, I feel very, very good that this very, very big and complicated bill has received such wonderful support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Holden). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, tonight the President of the United States will address a joint session of Congress to offer his assessment of the state of the Union. He is expected to spend a lot of time talking about domestic issues and will reportedly spend some time on the war on terror. However, very little, if any, of his State of the Union address will discuss the war in Iraq. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States has bungled the management of this war, and he certainly needs to explain further why he feels that escalation will suddenly turn the situation in Iraq around. The reality is that escalation will not bring us success. The President pushed forward against the advice of many Members of Congress, the joint chiefs of staff, and many experts in and outside of government. Even the Iraqi Prime Minister did not want more U.S. troops sent to his country. 
   Since Friday, January 19, 2007, 27 members of our armed services have died in Iraq. These deaths bring the total number of U.S. servicemembers that have died in Iraq since the war in Iraq began to 3,029. More than 22,000 others have been seriously injured. 
   The insurgent attacks against the United States military have become more and more brazen. In one of the attacks over the past weekend, insurgents wore uniforms that looked like official U.S. uniforms and used vehicles that the U.S. and Iraqi officials use. According to press accounts, Iraqi guards at a government compound allowed several vehicles traveling in a caravan through checkpoints because they were wearing what appeared to be legitimate U.S. military uniforms and driving cars commonly used by foreigners. Once the insurgents were inside the compound, they attacked and killed five of our troops. Witnesses say that the attackers targeted only U.S. servicemembers and not the Iraqis who were in the room. Elsewhere in Iraq, 12 Americans were killed when their Blackhawk helicopter was attacked, and 10 others were killed in fire fights with insurgents. 
   Mr. Speaker, Iraq is in a civil war. The level of violence is growing each day, and increasingly our troops are caught in the middle of it. By adding more troops, as the President plans to do, we will only increase the risk of more U.S. deaths and injuries. 
   Nearly everyone agrees that the war will not be won through military means. Instead, there is general agreement that stability in Iraq and the Middle East will only come about through intense diplomatic efforts. 
   The President's Iraq policy has failed. Sending more troops to Iraq will only make the situation worse. As the saying goes: when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. Mr. President, I would urge you to stop digging and bring our troops home. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is what bothers me about what is happening in Iraq. Our military, our troops don't know a Sunni from a Shiite from a Kurd. They are with Iraqi soldiers who don't like them oftentimes, who desert us when there is a confrontation, and who undermine us. There are those who believe that the way that the insurgents got into the compound was they were allowed in there by Iraqi soldiers. 
   How can we win in the middle of a civil war? We can't win. It is time for the President of the United States to come up with a reasonable exit plan. We have not asked, and nobody is saying, Quick withdrawal. Withdrawal in 24 hours. Some would make you believe we are saying that, but we are not. We are talking about a well thought through reasonable plan for getting out of Iraq. Some people would like to say, Oh, if you don't continue to support the President's request for additional funds, that you are deserting the soldiers. Not so. 
   And the Members of this Congress have got to have the courage to stand up and explain the difference between the sound bites and what those on the opposite side of this issue would describe as our efforts of getting the soldiers out and the truth. The truth of the matter is we all know there is enough money in the pipeline to credibly come out of Iraq in a timely way.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I take this opportunity to thank the leadership for honoring the work and the request of the progressives of this House to place a bill before this body that we could feel good about supporting. 
   Some of us have been against this war. We have come to the floor. We have done interviews. We have worked the floor. We have done everything that we possibly can to communicate what we believe are the feelings of the American public about this war. The November vote indicated to us, and should have to others, that Americans are sick and tired of this war. They want to bring our soldiers home. They want to stop the loss of lives. They want to stop the money that is being spent, over $400 billion on Iraq and Afghanistan; 3,200 or more lives that have been lost; over 25,000 soldiers who have been seriously injured.     
   Some of us are not willing to spend other another dime on this war. And this bill that is before us, thanks to Barbara Lee and Mr. McGovern and to Lynn Woolsey and I, we have this bill that represents the thinking of the progressives of this House that simply says, we will give no more money to continue fighting this war, but rather, any money that is expended would simply be funds to help wind down this war and to bring our soldiers out; no permanent bases left in Iraq; and basically that no money would be spent on a surge. This surge that the President has initiated is placing our soldiers at  great risk. As a matter of fact, there is no safety in the Green Zone. As a matter of fact, we do not have friends in Iraq. The Sunnis are against us. The Shias are against us. The Kurds are against us. And those Iraqi soldiers that are embedded are undermining our soldiers. I would ask for an ``aye'' vote on this very progressive piece of legislation.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise in support of H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, and I am proud and pleased to do so. 
   I was elected in 1991; and one of my colleagues, who was elected at the same time, Ms. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, she has been in this battle ever since she has been here trying to educate this House and the Members of this Congress about the disenfranchisement of the people of the District of Columbia, and she has done a magnificent job of doing that. 
   That brings us to the point that we are today. We have worked out an agreement. We have bipartisan support. We have a piece of legislation that makes good sense. It will give representation to the people who live and work in this District, people who pay taxes. 
   When I rode in this morning, I rode in a taxicab with an elderly woman who has been driving a cab for 28 years. I struck up a conversation with her, and she told me that she had two sons in Iraq. I could not tell her about what we were doing on the floor today. I did not want to engage her in that conversation because I was too ashamed to even talk about the fact that she did not have representation, she did not have a voting representative because this body had not decided to use its power to give the vote to the people of the District of Columbia. But I am proud to stand here today because I think something wonderful is about to happen. 
   No matter the distortions about the Constitution, no matter the misunderstanding that I am hearing from the opposite side of the aisle, we are about to embark on something that is historical, that is constitutional, and is the right thing to do. And I am so pleased and proud to be a part of it as I stand here, looking in the eyes of my friend, Eleanor Holmes Norton, where I will be casting my vote with her today to give voting rights to the people of this District.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (CBC BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. I would like to begin by congratulating Congresswoman CAROLYN KILPATRICK, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Congressman BOBBY SCOTT, Chair of the CBC Budget Task Force, for their leadership in developing the CBC budget. 
   I strongly support the CBC budget because it provides sufficient funding for critical domestic priorities such as health care, education, and community development. For example, the CBC budget spends $112 billion more than the Budget Committee's budget and $158 billion more than the President's budget on education, training, employment, and social services. Yet the CBC budget still eliminates the deficit by 2012. 
   As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, I am deeply concerned about the need for affordable housing in America. The CBC budget recognizes that affordable housing is all but out of reach for many Americans. Just imagine, the 2006 average minimum wage required to rent affordable housing is $16.31 an hour, more than three times the Federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, putting most housing out of reach for many American families. 
   Approximately 6 million persons in this country are very needy, paying more than 50 percent of their income for housing. This is a real threat to families trying to educate their children and make ends meet. Affordable rental housing is critical to communities across this Nation. Public housing is still part of the solution, community development programs are part of the solution, and the renewal of the section 8 voucher and many other housing programs is part of the solution. 
   The President's fiscal year 2008 budget request would cut overall net funding for public housing by $477 million, from $6.4 billion to $5.9 billion, a cut of 7 percent. While the budget increases the operating fund by $136 million, public housing authorities are estimated to receive only 80 percent of their total operating expenses. The budget decreases the capital fund used to repair  and modernize public housing units by $415 million, to only $2.0 billion. 
   Continuing a downward spiral in funding, this is part of the effort to dismantle public housing as we know it. We cannot sit idly by and let this happen. The community development programs would be seriously eroded and undermined if left to this administration. The Brownfields and the section 108 loan guarantee program would also be eliminated. The Community Development Block Grant Program would be cut by 20 percent, losing $735 million. And the list goes on and on. 
   In addition, Section 202 and 811 housing programs for the elderly and disabled would be cut drastically in the administration budget proposal. Rural housing programs would also suffer serious cutbacks faring no better. 
   The administration's budget proposes to terminate the major Rural Section 515 rental housing program, which would leave thousands of families living in rural communities, many poor, working families with children, and the disabled and elderly without affordable housing. 
   There is another issue that I feel strongly about that is addressed in this budget. As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I am highly concerned about the origin and proliferation of gangs in communities throughout the United States. Along with full committee chairman JOHN CONYERS and Crime Subcommittee chairman BOBBY SCOTT, I plan to retool existing authorized Federal programs to comprehensively address this problem. This requires full funding of the following programs: the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant, the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program, the Youth Violence Reduction Demonstration Projects that are administered by the Department of Justice, and the Compassion Capital Fund, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
   In the city of Los Angeles, there are approximately 4,000 gangs and 39,000 gang members. For 2006, there were about 470 homicides, and 250 were gang related. Of the shootings in the city last year, 70 percent were gang related. According to a September 1, 2006, report by Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, it costs about $287 million to treat and hospitalize victims of nonfatal gang assaults countywide in one year. 
   This is not only in Los Angeles. There are gang problems all over America, and not simply in our cities but in our rural communities, in our suburban communities. 
   It is about time that we focus some efforts on dealing with the gangs from two perspectives: 
   Number one, we have got to have prevention. We have got to be able to provide social services. We have got to be able to meet the needs of people in communities that have no hope. 
   Number two, yes, we must be tough. But the answer is not simply lock them up and throw the key away. The answer is, how do we prevent young people, young children, from connecting and getting involved with gangs in the first place? We need serious funding and smart assembly of existing programs to effectively halt the recruitment of new gang members.  
   We need serious funding and smart assembly of existing programs to effectively halt the recruitment of new gang members; to reduce the incidence of homicide and violence between gangs; to implement programs that deliver support services and job training; and to enable communities to solve problems that lead to race-related gang tensions. 
   CONCLUSION
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the CBC Budget so that we can begin to tackle important issues like gang violence and the need for affordable housing in our communities.

   The revamped case management system, the toll-free complaint hotline, and record transfer process from the Defense Department to the Veterans Administration will provide timely and serious response to the medical needs of our veterans. 
   Through repeated tours of duty, our troops have been made more vulnerable to injury and serious health complications. The U.S. Veteran healthcare system desperately needs the improvements that this bill provides in order to accommodate the soldiers who will be returning from these multiple tours. 
   In the 35th Congressional District, I have assigned staff specifically to the task of fielding the many calls of veterans who need assistance. Out of all veteran calls that we receive in our District office, the number one reason is to help them get a live response and to navigate through the bureaucracy to obtain the medical benefits that they earned serving our country. Therefore, in Los Angeles, we have living proof that our system is broken and in need of the fixes that this legislation offers. 
   Congress has appropriated more than enough funds to give our veterans decent medical care when they come home. 
   I commend Mr. SKELTON for his leadership on these issues and support H.R. 1538. I ask my colleagues to pass this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $50 billion over the next five years for international health programs, including $41 billion for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, $4 billion for tuberculosis programs, and $5 billion for malaria programs. 
   I just returned from South Africa, where I received the ``OR Tambo Award,'' from South African President Thabo Mbeki. I received this award because of my efforts to end the brutal system of apartheid in South Africa and to obtain the release of South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison. Apartheid was dismantled and Nelson Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, when South Africa held its first democratic elections. 
   I was very proud to receive the OR Tambo Award because I have always been and continue to be a friend to South Africa. However, in South Africa today, the enemy is HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that 5.5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. That is more than any other country in the world. Over 18 percent of the adult population of South Africa is infected by HIV. Infected persons include thousands of well-educated professionals, such as doctors, nurses, civil servants and teachers. 
   Everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problem they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work. 
   The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers, and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS. That is why I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure in countries like South Africa and train at least 140,000 new health care professionals and workers for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care. The bill also includes prevention funds to stop the spread of HIV and treatment funds to allow infected individuals to live productive lives and continue to serve their communities. 
   It is impossible to address HIV without also addressing tuberculosis. Almost 9 million people develop tuberculosis every year. At least 2.4 million are killed by the disease. According to the World Health Organization, HIV and tuberculosis form a lethal combination, each speeding the progress of the other. In the past 15 years, tuberculosis rates have doubled in Africa overall and tripled in areas with high HIV concentrations. In some areas of Africa, up to 80 percent of tuberculosis patients also test positive for HIV. This makes tuberculosis clinics an ideal location for HIV prevention, treatment, and care. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in South Africa and around the world.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug companies for lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   American seniors are not getting the best possible prices for the drugs that keep them alive and in good health. A study by Families USA shows that the median drug prices among Medicare plans for the top 20 drugs prescribed for seniors is increasing at a rate of 7.4 percent per year. That's more than twice the rate of inflation. These price increases are passed on to seniors in the form of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. 
   Clearly, the Medicare prescription drug program has not resulted in the lowest possible prices for seniors. But it has resulted in record profits for drug companies. In November, the New York Times reported that the Medicare prescription drug program has proven to be a bigger financial windfall for big drug companies than even the most optimistic of Wall Street predictions. 
   The Veterans' Administration already negotiates with drug companies for lower drug prices for American veterans. In the Families USA study, the lowest price charged by Medicare prescription drug plans for all 20 of the top drugs was always higher than the lowest price obtained by the Veterans' Administration. 
   I am a great defender of our Nation's veterans. They have served our country with honor, and they deserve the lowest possible prices for their drugs. But so do our Nation's seniors. There is no reason why the U.S. Government should negotiate lower drug prices for veterans and not for seniors. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I urge the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate in good faith for lower prescription drug prices for American seniors.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. As you know, I introduced H.R. 1851 on March 29, 2007. I want to thank each of my colleagues, both on the Committee on Financial Services and in the House, who have joined with me to see that this important legislation passes the House. I especially want to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK for his leadership, Ranking Member JUDY BIGGERT, and CHRISTOPHER SHAYS for their original cosponsorship and support of H.R. 1851. 
   It has been less than 2 months since the Committee on Financial Services considered major reforms to the section 8 program. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, which passed the Committee on Financial Services by a vote of 52-9, is truly the culmination of work that began in the 109th Congress. 
   There are many Members of Congress who have expressed major concerns to me about the future stability of the section 8 voucher program, given the recent changes in the funding formula and its impact on tenants. This bill addresses many of those problems and will return much needed stability to the section 8 program and the 2 million low-income families who rely upon it. 
   We heard from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, public housing agencies, national housing interest groups and advocates, and other housing experts about the importance of reforming the section 8 program. While there is consensus that the section 8 program needed to be reformed, HUD disagrees on how to reform the program. 
   National housing organizations like the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities which represent those directly affected by the change in the funding formula agree that basing the funding for a program as important as the voucher program on data that is 3 years old is just simply bad policy. 
   In 2004, Congress changed how we paid public housing authorities for vouchers under lease. Instead of paying the actual cost of the voucher, the decision was made to pay for what the  voucher cost during a 3-month period in the previous year. This had disastrous consequences for PHAs. Many saw a cut in their funding. 
   While section 8 recipients had to bear the brunt of this policy change as waiting lists closed, many low-income families who had been waiting for affordable housing for years suddenly found housing denied to them. Because of cost concerns, some families were denied their right to move to areas that may have been a bit more expensive but had better job and educational opportunities. Some families saw an increase in rent as many PHAs scrambled to cut costs. 
   As families struggled under this formula, so did some of our Nation's largest PHAs. The snapshot funding system had consistently and has consistently underpaid some PHAs to the benefit of others. Because of the funding instability, these PHAs had no reason to house more families. As a result, housing authorities are sitting on $1.4 billion in unspent voucher funds. This nonuse of our voucher dollars is unacceptable because we have lost 150,000 vouchers as a direct result of the funding formula. 
   Clearly, this formula must be changed for the good of public housing agencies and the families they serve. HUD is just wrong in this issue. I flatly reject their just-released statement of policy on the bill. H.R. 1851 updates the voucher formula by basing funding for vouchers on the previous year's leasing and cost data. 
   The use of more accurate data will ensure that we stop overpaying and underpaying PHAs for vouchers, but instead come as close as we can to paying the actual cost of the voucher. This will enable HUD to better control costs than the section 8 voucher program. This funding approach was recently embraced by both Houses of Congress in H.J. Res. 20. 
   Vouchers are a scarce resource, but are even scarcer since the funding formula changed in 2004. Only one out of four families who are eligible for housing assistance, including vouchers, actually receive it. H.R. 1851 provides PHAs with several resources for increasing the number of families they serve. 
   First, the bill provides for the recapture and redistribution of most unspent voucher funds for housing agencies that have chosen not to use these dollars to PHAs that are capable and willing to spend them. This reallocation system will provide PHAs with an incentive to house more families. 
   Second, the bill provides tools for PHAs to pay for increased costs or emergencies without having to cut assistance to families or to request new funding from the HUD or the Congress. The bill allows PHAs to retain up to a 1-month reserve in the formula's first year. For those PHAs that need additional funds, the bill allows them to borrow up to 2 percent of their budget authority, to be repaid within the first 3 months of the following year. 
   Third, the bill provides an authorization of appropriation for 20,000 new incremental vouchers per year for 5 years. Congress has not authorized new vouchers since 2002. 
   During this period, we all know that the need for voucher assistance has grown, not declined. We are not meeting the need for housing vouchers for very low-income persons in this country, working families, the disabled and elderly. Additional vouchers are needed to make sure that the voucher program continues to keep up with the ever-expanding need for affordable housing in this Nation. 
   Fourth, the bill provides incentives for PHAs to increase families served by tying administrative funding to the number of families housed. 
   Fifth, the bill restores housing choice, an important feature of the voucher program which has been lost because of cost concerns. H.R. 1851 would eliminate the complex billing process between PHAs using portable vouchers. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a bill that will restore stability and predictability to the Nation's largest 
   Federal housing program by fixing the broken funding formula. H.R. 1851 provides for the needs of the families, public housing agencies and landlords who participate in this program. 
   The funding formula, however, is not the only aspect of the section 8 program in need of reform. Today, housing agencies and program recipients must deal with the complicated set of rules for the determination of rent, recertification of income and inspection of housing units. H.R. 1851 simplifies those requirements, while maintaining current affordable standards. 
   H.R. 1851 also includes tools to encourage voucher families to move to economic self-sufficiency. Families should not have to pay more in rent because they want to work to provide for their families. By disregarding a portion of earned income, H.R. 1851 would protect families from any resultant increases in rent. 
   Families also shouldn't be penalized for pursuing educational opportunities. Currently, many families in the voucher and public housing programs can find themselves excluded from work and economic opportunities because of a lack of credit history or low credit scores. The bill would allow the Department to work with the Nation's credit bureaus to allow for the reporting of the rental payment history of voucher and public housing recipients. 
   In addition, the bill will increase homeownership opportunities for voucher families by allowing them to use a section 8 voucher to make a down payment on their first home. Importantly, the bill provides for a change to the funding structure for family self-sufficiency coordinated to ensure that families have the tools to take advantage of these opportunities. 
   Without going into all of what is taken care of and what is reformed, I have tried to share the major reforms that we have created for our families who will be receiving assistance through the section 8 program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman and Members, I am so very proud of the work of this committee. 
   I am so very, very pleased and honored to have the opportunity to work with BARNEY FRANK. Not only is he a committed public policy maker, he is smart, and he is creative. And he is helping us to understand how to use this wonderful opportunity that has been afforded to us to do good for the people of this country. 
   I am so pleased about this particular bill, because I am so keenly aware of the housing crisis that we have in this country. 
   As we stand here this evening, there are people who are sleeping under bridges; living with them are families, children. Some of them are veterans. I come from a time and place where people did not have decent housing. I know, too, that not only has this occurred for many years in this country, where people have been living in substandard housing, even today we have people without running water. We have people without proper health facilities of any kind in their homes. 
   We have families that are crowded into one and two rooms. We have people whose roofs were leaking this evening. But because of this government and our ability to help government understand what it can do to help the least fortunate, we are able to pass this kind of legislation. 
   I want to thank my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, again, Mrs. Biggert, for the cooperation that I have enjoyed working with her. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this moment to thank someone who is not here in the Congress with us at this time. 
   When we first started this legislation in the previous Congress, it was with Mr. Bob Ney who served as chair of the subcommittee; I was the ranking member; and we put this bill out on the floor where it passed this House, and he deserves credit for all the work that was done. 
   I would also like to thank some of the other members who we have not heard from this evening in general debate and hopefully we will hear from a little later on. Mr. Green from Texas who insisted that we expand the vouchers to make them available to the needy families who certainly have been standing in line waiting on section 8 vouchers. 
   I would like to thank Mr. DAVID SCOTT for being one of the most adamant and fierce defenders of the work that we have done and who has taken on the work of trying to educate some of our Members from the other side of the aisle, not only about the need, but how not to penalize the victims and people who are looking for housing opportunities who would not be able to get them but for section 8 and the work that we are doing. 
   With that, I would like to close by thanking the chairman who is so committed to helping those who need us most. He is certainly the kind of leader that we can depend on to make sure that everything possible is done, to utilize the time that we have been given in this committee to work for people who oftentimes have been dropped off of America's agenda. Again, he provides strong leadership. He is generous with sharing opportunities with everybody that serves on that committee. And it is because of that kind of leadership and, again, the cooperation from my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, Mrs. Biggert, Mr. Miller, Mr. Shays, and others that we come to this floor tonight with a good strong bill that is going to help so very many people in this country, and it is the kind of public policy that makes us all feel very good about being elected officials.

   Ms. WATERS. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. BARNEY FRANK, and Ranking Member JUDY BIGGERT for their strong support of the manager's amendment to H.R. 1851. 
   The purpose of the amendment is to reform and improve the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, regarding inspections, flexibility in rent-setting, transitional funding for the Nation's Public Housing Agencies, administrative fee calculations, limited English proficiency requirements, and the Housing Innovation Program. It also makes technical corrections to the bill. 
   The amendment provides more flexibility to make inspections by requiring them less frequently than every 2 years. This change will allow PHAs in areas with a deteriorating housing stock to conduct additional inspections in order to make sure families are housed in safe and decent units. In addition, the amendment fills the need for inspections that can be conducted at the request of the tenant within a specific amount of time. 
   My amendment solves a real catch-22 that often arises in the section 8 program. Many section 8 landlords are not large real estate concerns, but mom-and-pop operations that are not getting rich. Where units operated by a landlord fail inspection, right now there is a real danger that the landlord will choose to leave the program rather than make the repairs. This benefits nobody. And there is the catch-22. The landlord wants to stay in the program; the tenant certainly wants to stay in the unit if it can be repaired; but current law makes this positive resolution difficult to achieve. 
   PHAs will have the option to make repairs on the landlord's behalf. If the PHA or the landlord choose not to make the repair, the amendment protects tenants who will have to move to a new unit through no fault of their own. In the event a PHA chooses not to make a repair and the landlord still declines to repair the unit, the amendment provides important tenant protections. 
   There is rent flexibility. Sometimes the rigid section 8 rent structure just  doesn't work. In order to find a rent mechanism that works, the amendment gives PHAs flexibility in setting rents. While the calculations may be different, the amendment preserves affordability standards that limit the amount of rent a tenant pays to 30 percent of his or her income. The 30 percent threshold is sacred, because we all know that if the rent exceeds this amount, tenants lose the ability to make ends meet. 
   When we move to a new funding formula, PHAs will need sufficient reserves to allow them to make the change smoothly and with little disruption for tenants. H.R. 1851 provides a 1-month reserve for the first year of the formula. But to ensure that PHAs are able to serve additional families in the formula's first year, the amendment moderately increases this reserve from the 1-month level to the 1 1/2 -month level. This ensures PHAs will have adequate funds to transition. 
   The amendment corrects the disparity between the calculation of the administrative fees for project-based units owned by PHAs and other units in the PHA's inventory. Units owned by PHAs would receive the same fee as other units receiving project-based assistance in the PHA's inventory, providing an incentive for PHAs to create housing opportunities by project-basing its own units. 
   The amendment also addresses HUD's problematic implementation of Limitation of English Proficiency requirements. The manager's amendment seeks to remedy this problem. The amendment calls for HUD to convene a task force of interested parties and stakeholders who will determine the documents that need to be translated, and to make these translations available in various languages within 6 months. HUD is also required to maintain a housing information resource center, including a 24-hour toll-free number and a document clearinghouse. 
   We also include Housing Innovation Program, that is HIP program, formerly known as Moving to Work, and this amendment makes several corrections to the Housing Innovation Program formerly called Moving to Work. These changes clarify that troubled agencies are not eligible to participate in the program, clarifies resident participation requirements, specifies job opportunities to be made for residents, and ensures that following demolition or replacement of public housing units, that families cannot be screened out of public housing unless they are otherwise ineligible under Federal law. 
   I ask support for the manager's amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Ike Skelton for getting us to this point today, 1,581 days, 53 months, over 4 years since this President led this Nation to war in Iraq; 3,600 American soldiers killed, 27,000 American soldiers seriously injured, 60,000 to 100,000 Iraqis killed; $10 billion per month, $500 billion American dollars spent on this war. 
   A civil war is raging in Iraq; there is no credible government in Iraq; Iraq is  totally destabilized and Iraq refugees are flooding into neighboring countries; there is no coalition of the willing supporting the U.S. in this war; and we are well on our way to destabilizing the entire Middle East. 
   President Bush and the chief architect of this war, Vice President Dick Cheney, are in denial about the disastrous mess they have created. Some of us have known for quite some time this war must end. BARBARA LEE, LYNN WOOLSEY and I and several other Members of Congress created the Out of Iraq Caucus over 2 years ago. We organized this caucus, but we were dismissed as bleeding heart liberals. 
   It has taken too long to get to this point we are at today. This bill will at least demand a strategy to get us out of Iraq and a deadline will be set. This has been a long time in coming. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. President Bush will apply all kinds of pressure, threaten, mislead, spend us blind and continue to pursue this immoral war, unless we decide that we are not going to fund this war anymore. 
   In the words of the people on the street who are organized against this war, Mr. President, not another nickel, not another dime, not another soldier, not this time. 
   Vote for this bill. It is a good start. And remember, in the final analysis, we have got to defund this war.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to support this rule because it is so important that we move to deal with the sub-prime crisis in this country. It is not getting better. It is getting worse. And we find that community after community is being destroyed because we have boarded up, foreclosed homes that are driving down the property values, driving down the cost of the houses that are now upside down on their mortgages, and they cannot sell them and they're stuck. 
   And so the Rules Committee has worked hard, understanding the many aspects of this issue, and they have heard the legislation that is before us today that would simply mark down these properties by 15 percent. FHA, which we have strengthened, will do the refinance on these properties. We've also learned that FHA has been strengthened substantially with this legislation, and that part of the bill that I've been very much involved in will provide about $4 billion to cities and counties so that they can have money to rehabilitate these properties, put them back on the market for sale and for rent, and help to stabilize these neighborhoods. 
   And so the GSEs are in the bill, and you're going to hear a lot about the GSEs. But the fact of the matter is this bill is about stabilizing this economy, and we cannot afford to have the largest two semi-government agencies unprotected. While some people know that there's more work to be done on the GSEs, we're talking about now making sure that we put confidence in the market and that we send a message out there that we're not going to have disruption in the market at this time, that we're going to do something about the foreclosures and about the problems that we're confronted with. 
   I thank you.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   I want to thank Barney Frank for the wonderful work that he has done negotiating some very difficult parts of this bill. This bill is urgently needed to help our Nation address the current foreclosure crisis and its impact on world financial markets. I want to thank a number of people, the members of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity and the bipartisan members who voted for many aspects of this bill when that legislation came before our committee. I want to thank the Black Caucus for standing strong and insisting that we have money to help those communities that were targeted by the lenders for this subprime mess that they put us in. 
   Do I like everything in this bill? No, I don't. I'm frankly disappointed that we were unable to strike the language that was placed in this bill on the Senate side that effectively killed one of the most successful programs to help poor and low-income would-be homeowners, the down payment assistance program. But this is not the end of that. We shall be back so that we can continue that program. 
   Do I support some of the more controversial aspects of this bill? I do. I stand here today in support of the GSEs. I think it is very, very important that we maintain support for the GSEs so that we can stabilize this economy. It's absolutely unthinkable that we would allow these GSEs to go down in any shape, form or fashion when they hold 50 percent of all of the mortgages in this country and about $6 trillion in debt. 
   And so, I must commend the President--I have never thanked him for anything--for understanding the best interests of this country and removing his veto threat because of the $4 billion that we have in CDBG money. They say politics makes strange bedfellows from time to time and this bill may be the finest example of that. 
   I was most active on the modernization of the Federal Housing Administration and the $4 billion in the CDBG funding for States and localities to purchase, rehabilitate and resell or rent out abandoned and foreclosed homes. The modernization of FHA has long been a priority of mine because in recent years FHA had become obsolete in many parts of the country due to its low loan limits, outdated rules and slow bureaucracy. I saw too many low-income home buyers in California with little choice but to turn to the subprime mortgage market for assistance. 
   This Congress, I introduced H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Home Ownership Act of 2007, to give FHA the tools and resources to allow it to assist more low-income homebuyers. H.R. 1852 passed the House on September 18, 2007, on a bipartisan vote of 348-72, and again on May 8 of this year, as part of the H.R. 3221, the first go-round on this housing rescue package. 
   I want to thank all of the coalition of groups, the mayors and the organizations that supported this bill.

   Ms. WATERS. As we wind down this debate, I again want to thank BARNEY FRANK for his tremendous leadership. I want to thank Nancy Pelosi for listening to BARNEY FRANK and coming together to take a very strong stand to help us to realize this very comprehensive and relevant piece of legislation. 
   This legislation does a lot of good things: first-time home buyers assistance, tax credits, low-income housing tax credits, counseling funds that are targeted to the most needy neighborhoods, the strengthening of FHA, the refinancing of troubled mortgages by FHA, $4 billion to the cities, standby authority for the GSEs help to create more confidence in the markets. 
   The sub-prime meltdown created a crisis. This is a comprehensive, realistic response, and I'm proud of the work not only of Chairman Frank but of CHARLIE RANGEL and Senator Dodd who left the $4 billion in from the Senate side, the Financial Services Committee, my Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. 
   We did not get the seller funded downpayment assistance program, but my subcommittee will start immediately to work on this legislation so that we can come back in a few months with a stand-alone piece of legislation to do what needs to be done. 
   This is an important program. This program that's helped over 730,000 homeowners between the year 2000 and 2007 is extremely important to helping those who can't afford to pay the mortgage every month. They cannot afford that downpayment to get into the home. It works. It works well. It needs to be understood. We need to put it in law and do it correctly.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones for the leadership that she's providing this evening, having taken out the time on the floor to have the members of the Congressional Black Caucus engage this body on this issue of the war in Iraq. I thank you for your leadership, and I'm proud to work with you to help bring our Congress to the conclusion that we must get out of Iraq. 
   Last week, President Bush and his White House propaganda machine made another attempt at misleading the Nation. Yet again, unsubstantiated anecdotal claims of progress were used to support a continued occupation of Iraq. 
   However, the President's claims of progress ran contrary to multiple independent reports recently published, including, from the Government Accountability Office, General Jones, and the National Intelligence Estimate. These reports painted a bleak picture of Iraq: continued high levels of violence, a dysfunctional Iraqi government, and sectarian influence that continue to plague the Iraqi security forces. 
   President Bush's vision of an enduring relationship with Iraq amounts to an endless and unlimited military occupation. Instead of a significant change of policy, the President has reaffirmed his commitment to a dangerous continuation of a failed policy in Iraq. 
   Deepening sectarian divisions in Iraq make the American military presence increasingly obsolete. In fact, our presence may actually be making the situation worse as Iraqi political leaders hide behind our troops and refuse to make the necessary compromises. 
   Meanwhile, we continue to train and equip Iraqi security forces and so-called volunteer Sunni sectarian militias across Iraq. Experts suggest that we're merely training different sides of a violent civil war, and losing track of over 190,000 weapons meant for the security forces is surely only adding fuel to the fires raging in Iraq. That is why my colleagues and I recently introduced H.R. 3134, the Responsible Security in Iraq Act. This legislation will halt the dangerous practice of training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, at least until the Iraqi Government matures. 
   At the cost of precious American lives, the President seeks only to disguise the fact that he has no exit strategy for Iraq. It becomes increasingly clear that George Bush seeks only to protect his own legacy and saddle the next President with the mess he's created in the Middle East. 
   Let us not forget that, in addition to almost 3,800 troops who have died, 800 of those troops who have died in Iraq have died since the surge was announced in January, including 16 troops since General Petraeus came to Congress to testify just last week. 
   I know that the media, many in the media have blamed the wonderful, wonderful support group of the Democratic Caucus and people who want to get us out of Iraq for attacking General Petraeus. But I join with them, not in an attack on General Petraeus, but in telling the truth about what has been happening. 
   Moveon.org need not be ashamed of its advocacy. They need not be a shame of its ads. They are telling the truth, and we need to speak truth to power on this issue. 
   President Bush sought to appease those who oppose the war by announcing that 5,700 troops will be coming home this year, and another few brigades will possibly return by summer of next year. But these reductions were scheduled to occur with or without Bush's consent. Deployment limits are being reached, and the military has no trained and ready troops to replace the ones leaving. 
   As the New York Times stated, it's like George Bush dropping an object and then taking credit for gravity. 
   Regardless, these planned reductions would merely lower our troop levels to 130,000 by summer of 2008. It is absolutely unacceptable that our military presence in Iraq by next summer will still be the same as pre-surge levels. 
   I'm delighted for the families of the troops who will be leaving Iraq. Many of these troops will be returning from a second, third or even fourth deployment. However, without a significant change in strategy, the President is  signaling that these troops should not get too comfortable at home. President Bush will surely have them deployed back to Iraq as soon as possible. 
   As Chair of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I, along with my colleagues, have been advocating for a different direction for years now. In stark contrast to the direction of the President, we understand that the only acceptable option for Iraq is a fully funded withdrawal of all of our troops and military contracts. 
   The other day, my friend, Congressman John Murtha said, and I quote, ``Yes, many Iraqis consider us the occupiers. But it is also true that Iraq is really occupying us.'' We couldn't be more right. He couldn't be more right. 
   Let's bring our troops home to their families as soon as possible and refocus this country's resources on the issues that matter the most to the American people. It is time to end this war in Iraq. 
   And to those who are getting a little bit disgusted with the fact that we don't seem to be making as much progress as we should here in the Congress of the United States, I would like to encourage them not to give up. 
   I know that it appears that Petraeus and the President organized a presentation and tried to win over the hearts of Americans by putting a general out there, just as he put Colin Powell out when Colin Powell went up to the U.N. and pointed to the buildings where weapons of mass destruction were being manufactured. Colin Powell has said since that time, it was perhaps the worst thing that he could have done in his career. And of course, people respect generals, and they respect Petraeus because he has a long history of having made sacrifice and having been a good warrior. 
   But ladies and gentlemen, he's wrong on this one. 
   We don't have to back up. We don't have to shy away from this fight. We don't have to give in and think somehow we're going to be thought of as unpatriotic. Patriotism is to stand up for what is right, what is right for the security of this Nation. 
   We're at greater risk now than we were before we went in to invade Iraq. As a matter of fact, this President and this war has unsettled the entire Middle East. We know that since we've been there, not only have we created a civil war and all of the sectarian violence, we also know that we have pulled in to this war Iran, and we also know that we are on the verge of pulling in Syria to this war. We also know that this entire Middle East is unsettled because of our occupation. 
   Despite the fact that the President of the United States said we would be welcomed with open arms, they want us out of Iraq. They want to end the occupation. 
   Yes, we have some responsibilities there. Yes, we should help to rebuild Iraq, but first, we must bring our soldiers home. We must stop the carnage. We must stop the killings. We must bring our soldiers home. 
   And I join with Barbara Lee and Lynn Woolsey and members of the Congressional Black Caucus who support the idea that we will vote for funding to bring the troops home safely and securely. We will not vote for funding to continue this war. 
   We know that the President of the United States has made another request in a supplemental. I will not be voting for any funding to continue the war. And for those of us who really, really believe in what we're saying, for those of us who are committed to the proposition that we can end this war, we will not give him another dime to continue the war.

   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to note in the Record that I mistakenly voted ``aye'' on Roll Call 632, that was H.R. 2368, the Consolidated Security Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009. I mistakenly voted ``aye'' on H.R. 2368. I did not realize the Defense appropriation and funding for the war in Iraq was included in the continuing appropriation. Had I known, I would have voted ``no.''

<DOCNO>Ms. WATERS. (OPPOSING FCC MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman JAY INSLEE, for his work on opposing the FCC's media ownership rules and for arranging time to bring this issue to the House floor this evening. 
   I was proud to cosponsor his resolution, H.J. Res. 79, a resolution to disapprove of the Federal Communications Commission's media ownership rules. 
   The FCC has neglected to deal with the crisis in minority ownership. Only 44 of the more than 1,200 TV stations are owned by people of color. The situation is particularly dire for the African American community. The number of African American owners has dropped 60 percent from 2006 to 2007. There are only eight TV stations in this country owned by African Americans. 
   Unfortunately, the FCC's vote last December to lift the newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rules would take direct aim at minority broadcast owners. According to the FCC, the new rule allows a newspaper to buy a television station in our Nation's largest markets if the outlet is ranked outside the top four. 
   There are at least two problems with the rule: One, it is not what it appears to be. The new rule contains loopholes that will allow for greater consolidation in potentially every market in this country. Second, nearly half of all minority-owned stations operate in the top 20 markets and all are ranked outside the top four. This would make them a target for acquisition and make it harder for people of color to purchase stations in larger markets. This is unacceptable. 
   The FCC seems not to care about the state of minority ownership. In fact, the FCC has no idea how many stations are actually owned by people of color because the Commission has failed to keep track of their own data. The only reason I'm able to cite statistics on minority ownership is due to the diligent work of a nonprofit group to conduct an accurate census and do the work the FCC should have conducted itself. 
   Last year, the FCC conducted several ownership studies prior to its December vote but failed to count 69 percent of minority-owned TV stations and 75 percent of female-owned stations. The failure of the FCC to properly address the crisis in minority ownership is stunning, since the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 chastised the FCC for its failure to address the issue of minority ownership the last time it attempted to allow for further media consolidation. 
   The lack of minority ownership and minority representation has real consequences for our society. It is no wonder many feel the media continues to marginalize people of color, causing our communities great harm. 
   There has been too much incompetency from independent regulatory agencies during the 8 years of the Bush administration. This lack of accountability has to stop, and I'm so proud of the millions of Americans who have spoken out through the years and have said ``no'' to media consolidation. This is especially true in the 35th Congressional District, where my constituents have fought so hard to block the deal between KTLA and the Los Angeles Times newspaper. On behalf of my constituents, I filed a brief in the continuing litigation to oppose the merger of these two giants that would have the effect of silencing the voices of many of my constituents. 
   It is going to be because of the many individual voices for free speech and diversity that we are going to continue to hold the FCC accountable for serving the public interest needs of the American people. 
   I promise I will continue to fight on and to fight for a media system that strengthens our democracy instead of weakening it.
