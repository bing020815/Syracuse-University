<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act. 
   In the last year there have been countless reports about dangerous products that have slipped through the cracks and reached store shelves, only to be discovered when someone got hurt. There has been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products away from consumers. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls: 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006, and it's the American consumer, especially children, who are suffering. 
   It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give the chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources necessary to get unsafe products off the shelves and stop them from coming into the country. 
   This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the Commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce Federal consumer safety rules. 
   I'm pleased that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This an is important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products. 
   On the other hand, I'm disappointed that my amendment on allowable lead levels in children's toys was not accepted. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health. 
   I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee as well as all of my colleagues that have worked so hard to bring this bill forward. So I rise, obviously, in support of it because I think the bill is going to make an enormous difference in the safety and the effectiveness of drugs and medical devices used to treat adults and children. 
   I think the bill also strengthens the FDA. I think the American people want the FDA to be an agency that is strong in its protection of consumers around the country. We know that there have been shortcomings that have had terrible effects on many families in our country. So, I think this bill is a victory in that arena. 
   I am also pleased that the bill adopts much of my legislation relative to children and pharmaceutical drugs for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has instructed us that only about 25 percent of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested and labeled for use in kids. Pediatricians often had to prescribe adult pharmaceuticals for children by telling parents, ``cut the pill in half, cut it in thirds, cut it in quarters.'' We understood that we had to do better. By every measurement, the reauthorization of this legislation, previous legislation, was supported because it was very, very successful. We know that children are not small adults, and the legislation recognizes that. We have reauthorized, and we are doing the right thing. 
   I am pleased that the blockbuster provision is not a part of this legislation. The other body supported that. I didn't. This bill doesn't. In all negotiations, there is always give-and-take. There are items I supported that didn't make it into the package, including the permanent extension of the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which I championed, obviously, as part of my legislation in the original House bill. I hope that we can get to this at some point. I am sorry it is not in this bill. 
   Overall, I want to thank all of my colleagues that made this possible and that we are here today; certainly, Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, most especially the professional staff, because they do so much work, no one more than John Ford of our staff, and Virgil Miller. I would like to also thank Jennifer Nieto Carey, formerly of my staff, who worked so hard and extensively to help bring us to this point. 
   So this is a good bill. I think the whole House should support it. I think it is a tribute to the substance of it, that it is coming up under suspension. I salute everyone that made the effort a winning one. Most importantly, I think the bill is a winner for the people of our country, both children and adults.

   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act. 
   This bill will make an enormous difference in the safety and effectiveness of drugs and medical devices used to treat adults and children. 
   I'm pleased that the bill adopts much of my legislation (H.R. 2589, Improving Pharmaceuticals for Children Act) to renew the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA). Together, BPCA and PREA represent two halves of a comprehensive effort to make sure that prescription drugs are appropriately tested and labeled for children. 
   According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 25 percent of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested and labeled for use in kids. Pediatricians often have to prescribe drugs for ``off-label'' use, because the drug has not been studied in appropriate FDA-approved pediatric clinical trials. Children are not small adults; they have specific medical needs that have to be considered when drugs are used. Children have died or suffered serious side effects after taking drugs that were shown safe for use in adults but had different results in children. 
   The bill helps improve drug safety for children in two ways. First, under BPCA, the bill provides an incentive, an extra 6 months of marketing exclusivity, for a drug if the innovator company agrees to undertake comprehensive pediatric studies requested by the FDA. Second, under PREA, FDA is granted authority to require studies when there is a demonstrated need and drug companies are required to submit a pediatric assessment each time they apply to market a new drug or change an existing drug's indication. 
   I'm pleased this bill continues the BPCA incentive without the so-called ``blockbuster provision'' adopted by the Senate. The Senate's proposal would have reduced the incentive for drugs with annual sales of $1 billion, and, I believe the Senate language had the potential to kill ``the goose that laid the golden egg.'' The 6-month incentive has worked. According to GAO, 81 percent of the time FDA has offered this incentive for a drug, drug companies have accepted, undertaking studies that have generated pediatric data that would otherwise not have been available. Scaling back the incentive for ``blockbusters'' would risk that proven record of success. That is a gamble on the  health of children, and I'm pleased it's not in the bill. 
   In all negotiations there is give and take. There are items I supported that didn't make it into this package, including the permanent extension of PREA which I championed as part of my legislation and the original House bill. I hope we'll have a chance to revisit the issue in the next reauthorization, if not sooner. 
   On balance, this bill will make a huge improvement in the safety of drugs and devices. We should pass it and send it to the President today. 
   I want to commend Chairman DINGELL, Ranking Member BARTON and the professional staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, especially John Ford and Virgil Miller, as well as Jennifer Nieto Carey formerly of my staff, who worked extensively on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, this is the first forward-looking energy bill to come before Congress in a generation and it is sorely needed because our nation and our planet are at risk because of our dependence on fossil fuel. We are doing nothing less than asserting America's leadership in solving our own and the world's most significant energy and environmental problems. 
   Today, our national security is at risk because the U.S. is increasingly beholden to foreign governments for the energy that fuels our economy, and greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to greater global insecurity due to changes in the climate and their repercussions. Consumers see the effects of dependence in their pocketbooks each time they fill up. Our interests in the Middle East are dictated by our need for oil. Throughout the world we see the environmental impact of the dependence on fossil fuel on our environment ... whether it's an oil spill or more intense hurricanes or droughts. 
   Today we're taking a historic step in changing this dynamic. 
   The auto fuel efficiency provisions in this bill reduce our oil consumption by more than 4 million barrels per day by 2030--more than twice the amount of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf. 
   The bill will also reduce global warming pollution by the equivalent of 300 coal-fired power plants. By 2030 we will cut emissions by up to 35 percent of what scientific experts say we must achieve to prevent climate catastrophe. 
   Many said it would be impossible to reach agreement on raising fuel economy standards and requirements for renewable energy, but this bill delivers. 
   It raises fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 28 million cars, and saving consumers up to $1,000 once it is fully implemented. 
   The bill also requires 15% of the electricity produced in the U.S. to be generated from renewable resources, and it sets goals for the use of renewable fuels--36 million gallons by 2022. 
   These are enormous steps, and combined with provisions on energy efficiency, including a provision I authored on computer data center efficiency, this bill will reshape energy production and consumption. It will foster the development of new energy development that could make the U.S. an exporter of energy technology instead of an importer of oil and gas. 
   This is the bill I've been waiting 15 years to vote for and I'm thrilled the moment has arrived.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   Despite the recent surge in high corporate profits, middle class families have actually lost ground financially due to the rising costs of education, healthcare, housing and transportation. Unfortunately, under the current system for forming unions, workers are routinely denied the right to determine for themselves whether to organize. Employees oftentimes face coercion, intimidation, and harassment from employers trying to discourage unionization. These tactics discourage workers from bargaining collectively for higher pay, more substantial benefits, and better treatment in the workplace. 
   The benefits of unionization are well known. Workers who belong to a union earn an average of 30 percent more than nonunion workers and are much more likely to have health care and pension benefits.  
   Under this legislation, if a majority of workers in a workplace sign valid cards authorizing a union, then the workers would be able to have a union. This process is already possible; however, current law enables employers to veto the formation of a union without an election administered by the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act also institutes stronger penalties for employers violating the National Labor Relations Act during any period when employees are attempting to organize a union or negotiate a first contract with the employer. In 2005 alone, more than 31,000 workers received backpay because of unlawful employer behavior of this sort. H.R. 800 also provides for up to $20,000 in civil penalties for willful or repeated violations during an organizing or first contract campaign. These penalties provide a serious disincentive for employers engaging in anti-union tactics. 
   The decision to form a union should be in the hands of employees. This legislation provides people with the opportunity to make this decision freely and fairly and to bargain for a better life for themselves and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rules package before us. As we begin the important work of the 110th Congress, it is imperative that we set the tone for how the people's work will be conducted in this chamber, which is the people's House. 
   In the November elections, Democrats offered Americans a new direction and a more ethical Congress. The American people responded with great clarity. Exit polls revealed that 74 percent of voters in November cited corruption as an important issue in determining their vote. 
   Now it is our turn to act. That's why we are taking immediate steps to fulfill the promise of a more ethical Congress by passing a comprehensive rules package that bans gifts and travel from lobbyists; requires adequate time to review legislation and bans the insertion of special interest provisions in the `dead of the night' to ensure that Members have time to read the bills being considered and know exactly what is in them; mandates annual ethics training for all Members and staff; curbs abuses of voting time to ensure that votes are not held open to change the outcome; requires full disclosure of all earmarks, as well as requiring that a Member certify that earmarks do not financially benefit them or their spouses; and reinstates Pay-As-You-Go budget rules to prevent all new spending and tax cuts from adding to the federal debt. 
   Passage of this legislative package will begin the process of restoring integrity to the House of Representatives, assuring the people of our country that we are here on their behalf, not our own. I urge my colleagues to vote for this rules package.

I don't think that this is a complicated question that is here before us today. I think that it is very clear. It is very clear in terms of the values of the American people. Why wouldn't a Congress, any Congress, offer health insurance for its most vulnerable citizens, the little ones, of our country? 
   That is what is on the floor today. That is what is on the floor. They are smart, and they are grinning. Grinning. But do you know what?

And imagine the person that stands at the doctor's door and not allow children to go through: the President of the United States. 
   This is a bipartisan effort. The people of our country want us to come together for the families of this country, for the betterment of our country, to make an investment. Yes, through taxing tobacco. I would rather tax tobacco and protect the children of our country than to blow $10 billion a month in Iraq. I am proud of the Democrats. I am proud of the Republicans that support it. We should pass this and say a prayer that the President will come out of his cloud and sign the bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to continued war funding for Iraq. 
   I voted against the war and have never wavered in my opposition to the Administration's misguided policies in Iraq. 
   It has been a long and painful 5 year journey for the people of our country since the Administration acted preemptively and unilaterally to invade and occupy Iraq. 
   Military leaders, the best minds in foreign and economic policy, and the vast majority of the American people have been resoundingly clear: The Administration's war-without-end policy is not a strategy for success. 
   As retired General William Odom, former Director of the National Security Agency under President Reagan and member of the National Security Council under President Carter stated, ``Getting out of Iraq is the pre-condition for creating new strategic options.'' 
   I cannot support war funding without a clear exit strategy in sight. It is bad for our troops, our country, and our standing in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of today's second amendment that includes a clear path out of Iraq, a plan that my constituents and the vast majority of Americans are demanding. 
   More than 5 years ago the President proclaimed ``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq. Paradoxically, he insists on a permanent U.S. presence there. And what exactly has this Administration ``accomplished'' in Iraq? 
   More than 4,000 U.S. soldiers have been killed and almost 30,000 injured; tens of thousands Iraqi civilian deaths; an emboldened Iran and new threats from Al Qaeda in the region; $519 billion taxpayer dollars spent and a future expenditure of some $3 trillion; a hobbled Iraqi government unable to provide clean water, medical care, jobs for its people, or pass critical oil sharing legislation; a U.S. military on the verge of collapse and unable to press vigorously the critical fight in Afghanistan or respond to other crises in the world; and still no exit strategy. 
   With no end game in sight, the Administration and its supporters in Congress are complicit in a continuation of a failed policy which they insist on extending with a blank check policy to accompany it. 
   The President owes it to our brave men and women in Iraq and their families, he owes it to the American people, and he owes it to the citizens of Iraq not to leave this mess for the next President to finish. 
   This bill establishes a clear path out of Iraq. The language requires the Administration to begin redeployment 30 days after enactment and requires Secretary Gates to submit to Congress within 90 days a report detailing plans to reduce and redeploy troops from Iraq. It prohibits sending troops to Iraq that are not assessed as ``fully mission capable'' of performing their assigned mission, and outlaws the presence of a permanent U.S. base there. Additionally, this provision requires the Iraqi government to match every U.S. dollar spent for training and infrastructure construction and repair. Finally, it prohibits the intelligence community from subjecting detainees to interrogation techniques not authorized by the U.S. Army Field Manual. This will essentially abolish the use of water torture and begin to restore America's standing in the world community. 
   As a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence it is vital that we extend the ban on torture to the Intelligence agencies. The President has said he will veto any ban on torture, clearly demonstrating his desire to reserve for himself the right to subject detainees to these horrendous techniques. Congress has an obligation to make it clear that the American people do not believe in torture and will not allow it to continue. 
   This amendment sets a decisive course out of Iraq and begins to shift responsibilities to the Iraqi government. I urge my colleagues to heed the demands of the American people and support this strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm very pleased that the Appropriations Committee included two important provisions in today's third amendment. First, it includes critical funding for Iraqi Christians and second, it modernizes and improves the G.I. bill. 
   I'm pleased that the amendment contains $10 million for vulnerable Iraqi minorities, including Christians. The needs of Assyrians in Iraq could not be greater. A report produced by the Department of State on U.S. assistance to the Nineveh Plains in Iraq concluded that Christian minorities have experienced serious human rights abuses in the Nineveh Plains. The report also states that the region has absorbed a significant number of Christian internally displaced persons (IDPs) moving from the south, placing an economic burden in the area. 
   They are fleeing because they are being threatened and murdered in their home communities. Their priests are being executed, their churches burned, and their nuns threatened. In February of this year, Archbishop Paulos Rahho was abducted and murdered in Mosul. 
   While Assyrians only represented 5 percent of the total Iraqi population before the war, according to the United Nations today they comprise as much as 40 percent of the growing Iraqi refugees who have fled for their lives to Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. 
   These families desperately need security, housing, jobs, schools and the chance to live in a sustainable community where they can openly practice their faith. This funding is essential to their survival. 
   Also included in this amendment is a modernization of the G.I. bill. The G.I. bill has been heralded as one of the most successful government programs in the history of our Nation. It gave millions of G.I.s the chance to go to college, many of whom were the first to receive a college education in their families. But the G.I. bill is over 54 years old and has not kept up with rising tuition costs. 
   According to a recent Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) survey, 18 percent of the veterans recently back from tours of duty are unemployed. Of those employed since leaving the military, 25 percent earn less than $21,840 a year. The survey also demonstrated that only 48.4 percent of the respondents took advantage of the G.I. bill and concluded that receiving the benefits of the current G.I. bill was not a strong predictor of successful employment outcomes. 
   This survey clearly demonstrates the need for this new G.I. bill. The amendment provides veterans with a maximum educational benefit equal to the highest tuition rate of a public college or university in their State, as well as a monthly stipend for housing. It also establishes a new program in which private educational institutions would make financial contributions toward veterans' tuition, and the federal government would match those contributions. 
   When our veterans return from the battlefield, they should have every opportunity to enter the classroom and ultimately the civilian workforce. Our Nation needs these brave men and women to contribute to the growth and health of our economy and this new G.I. bill accomplishes this. 
   From development funding for Iraqi Christians to the creation of a new G.I. bill, this amendment addresses specific urgent needs for our Nation and world. The amendment is well crafted and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, the amendment that Mr. Shimkus and I are offering will provide $5 million for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) with the intent of allowing them to issue grants to upgrade Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), otherwise known as 9-1-1 call centers. Call centers across our country today need to enhance their 9-1-1 technology in order to actually locate where a mobile phone caller in crisis is. 
   Annually, over 200 million 9-1-1 calls are made, and increasingly those calls are made from mobile phones. According to CTIA, the wireless industry association, more than 10 percent of households now rely on wireless phones as their only telephone service. No wonder it's surprising to many Americans to learn that a 9-1-1 call center may not have enhanced technology to trace an emergency call from a mobile phone in order to dispatch help to exactly where it is needed. 
   Imagine calling 9-1-1 from your mobile phone at the scene of a car accident or a crime and being told the operator has no idea where you are. 
   Millions of Americans face this risk every day. 
   While coverage in many areas is improving, there are significant gaps in the public safety system, particularly in small, rural, and poor communities where federal assistance could be most meaningful. 
   In 26 states, more than 20 percent of counties have not deployed the latest 9-1-1 technology. In 15 states, well over half the counties haven't deployed this technology. In West Virginia (Chairman Mollohan's home state), nearly one third of the population doesn't have enhanced 9-1-1 coverage. In Ohio, half the state's population lacks this coverage, and in Mississippi, two-thirds. 
   In 2004, Congress and the President attempted to address this problem by enacting the ENHANCE 9-1-1 Act. The law that Mr. Shimkus and I authored created a grant program to pay 50 percent of the cost for upgrading 9-1-1 call centers and ensure the most precise location (within 300 meters in most cases) of an emergency call from a mobile phone. 
   The program was authorized to provide up to $1.25 billion in grants over 5 years. Regrettably, 3 years later Congress has yet to fund the program. In fact, the NTIA and National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA), the agencies with responsibility for this program, haven't even established regulations for awarding grants. With only 2 years left in the authorization, it's time to get the program underway. 
   The modest amount of funding in our amendment will provide grants to approximately 54 smaller counties to upgrade their wireless E9-1-1 capabilities or up to 17 grants to counties with populations over 100,000. This public safety funding is offset by reducing funds from the Justice Department's General Administration. 
   Our Amendment has been endorsed by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials and the National Emergency Number Association and I urge my colleagues to join me and Representative Shimkus in voting for it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, our country has just begun the fifth year of war in Iraq. By overwhelming numbers, the American people want a new direction and I believe this bill contains the policy and the plan to help bring an end to the misguided policies of the Administration. 
   Military leaders, Generals Abizaid, Odom and Powell, as well as former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, have all come forward to observe that the Administration's war-without-end policy is not a strategy for success. 
   Today's legislation directs itself to important change. It sets a new course for ending the war. 
   The bill requires accountability: It puts the Iraqis in charge of Iraq. If they cannot or will not bring their country under control, if conditions continue to worsen and political and military benchmarks are not met, beginning in July 2007 (less than four months from today), our troops will begin an immediate redeployment. 
   The bill begins a redeployment: It sets a firm timeline to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq and in legally-binding terms declares that all U.S. troops will be out of Iraq by August 31, 2008, if not sooner. 
   It requires the Iraqis--not our soldiers--to reign in the militias, aggressively pursue the insurgents and provide ``evenhanded security for all Iraqis.'' 
   The bill prohibits the establishment of any permanent military bases. It bans the use of torture. It redirects resources back to the fight against terrorism and Al-Qaeda, and recommits us to creating a stable state in Afghanistan. 
   The bill takes care of our troops. It provides over $3 billion more than the President's request to meet the neglected needs of our returning soldiers and veterans around the country. 
   The following are quotes from respected national leaders: 
   Retired General William Odom, former Director of the National Security Agency under President Reagan and member of the National Security Council under President Carter stated recently: ``Getting out of Iraq is the pre-condition for creating new strategic options.'' 
   According to former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski: 
   ``The United States cannot afford an open-ended commitment to a war without end. A means must be devised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq and reduce our troop levels, so that we can begin to rebuild our military and reclaim our position of leadership in the world. The bill the House will consider this week does that in an effective and responsible way.'' 
   Former NATO Commander Wesley Clark:  
   ``The conflict must be resolved politically--military efforts alone are insufficient--and this legislation strongly promotes that political solution.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this supplemental legislation. For the first time the debate about Iraq is not ``if' or ``how.'' It is about ``when'' ..... when our troops will come home. 
   It is binding language. 
   It is sensible language. 
   It is language that will change the direction of the war. 
   It is language that will help to heal our wounded troops. 
   It is language that will help heal our Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5819, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act. 
   The Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, programs are important sources of Federal support to facilitate the commercialization of research. Updating these programs will ensure the continuation of the central role they play in maintaining the preeminence of the U.S. research enterprise. 
   The importance of fostering public-private partnerships cannot be underestimated. I see firsthand all the aspects of the innovation process, because my Congressional district contains basic research institutions, hundreds of current and former SBIR- and STTR-awarded companies, and venture capital firms. The SBIR and STTR programs facilitate the transition of technologies to the market. The important changes made by this reauthorization include increasing the award guideline levels, establishing advisory boards to improve program effectiveness and outcomes, and emphasizing the importance of energy-related research proposals. 
   A key aspect of the debate surrounding this reauthorization has been whether or not venture capital-backed companies should be eligible to participate in the SBIR program. Small businesses with a proven ability to attract venture funding should not be excluded. 
   The original legislation which created the program stated that no federal funds could be used for the Phase 3 commercialization state of an SBIR award, requiring award recipients to seek venture capital and other private sector funding. Preventing those companies from returning to the program for a different project undermines its very objective of bringing more technologies to the market. A small business that wins an SBIR and then attracts VC funds has a proven ability to succeed, yet may have insufficient resources to pursue new research projects. These companies should be eligible to continue to participate in the program and I'm pleased to see that the reauthorization before us today maintains this position. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that Congress did not authorize a policy change to prohibit venture-backed companies from participating in the program. A ruling by an SBA administrative law judge made this interpretation and seriously damaged the program by disqualifying many good companies. Today we clarify the language and get the SBIR program back on the right track, without excluding small businesses which have successfully obtained venture capital funding for other technologies. 
   I know there are concerns that this bill's increase in the percentage of research funds that are directed to the SBIR and STTR programs will detract from the core research missions of the agencies. This is a particular concern for the NIH which has been working under a constrained budget over the last several years. We need to continue to increase funding at the NIH and other research agencies, and we should consider the impact of increasing the SBIR and STTR set-aside as the bill moves forward in the legislative process. 
   I hope the House will demonstrate strong bipartisan support for this bill to ensure that the innovators and entrepreneurs of our country continue to have Federal assistance to transition their research and ideas out of the labs and into the marketplace. I urge the entire House to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA. I was an original cosponsor of this bill when it was first introduced in 1994 and have supported it ever since. 
   This legislation is a long time in coming. For years we've had workplace protections in place for race, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability, but nothing to cover sexual orientation. Surprisingly, in 2007, it's still legal to fire someone based on their sexual orientation in 30 different States. ENDA will extend Federal employment discrimination protections to include sexual orientation for all workers. 
   This bill will not impose new costs and obligations on employers. ENDA will not require employers to give benefits to partners of gay, lesbian, or bisexual employees, although I believe they should. ENDA will not set ``quotas'' for hiring or provide special rights to a unique class of citizens. ENDA will simply end one of the last areas of legal discrimination against Americans in the workplace today. 
   As introduced in the 110th Congress, this bill originally included protections for transgendered Americans in their jobs. While the bill that comes to the Floor today does not include this provision, it is something I strongly support and will continue to advocate for. 
   I take pride in being a citizen of a country that promotes tolerance and equality ..... but we must ensure these founding principles extend to all American citizens. I believe ENDA is the next step for us to take on the journey toward full equality for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 1424 the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   Nearly two weeks ago the President presented legislation to Congress requesting a $700 billion recovery package, with the Treasury Secretary empowered to set the rules for all transactions. The bill included no safeguards, no transparency, no accountability, and no oversight. This plan was wrong for the American people and we rejected it. 
   The House, through bipartisan negotiations, completely reshaped the bill to include three crucial elements to rebuild our financial system. One, we reinvested in troubled financial markets to stabilize our economy and insulate Main Street from Wall Street. Two, we guaranteed that the taxpayer will be first in line to be reimbursed through ownership shares and asset recovery as the plan begins to work. Finally, the bill reformed how business is done on Wall Street including the prohibition of golden parachutes. 
   While I voted for the bill, it failed to gather the necessary votes for it to pass. Following the vote I returned home this week and saw, not only in my District, but all over the country, the negative effects of our continued inaction. Already, our commercial and consumer credit markets are drying up and if we continue to do nothing, the ability for my constituents to obtain home mortgages, car loans, student loans, loans for small businesses, or even credit cards will become highly difficult or impossible. Even more financial institutions and businesses could fail and millions could lose their pensions and retirement savings, thousands of jobs could be lost, and large parts of our economy could cease to function. The repercussions would be far greater than the cost of a financial rescue program. 
   Not only have small businesses and families felt the effect of the credit crunch, my home state of California is feeling it. According to our State Treasurer, Bill Lockyer, this current crisis threatens to deplete California's cash reserves. Without those reserves the state will be unable to pay teachers, first responders, or nursing care workers. Additionally, he thinks without action the state, ``..... will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for highway construction, schools, and housing or water projects.'' If we don't pass this bill the effects will almost immediately be felt throughout the country and the world. 
   H.R. 1424 includes strong independent oversight and transparency through an establishment of an independent bipartisan board to provide oversight, review and accountability of taxpayer funds. The Government Accountability Office will have a presence at Treasury to oversee the program and conduct audits to ensure strong internal controls, and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. There will be an independent Inspector General to monitor the Treasury Secretary's decisions in regard to this program and all transactions will be posted online for the public to review. 
   Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once, the legislation gives the Treasury $250 billion immediately, then requires the President to certify that additional funds are needed ($100 billion, then $350 billion, subject to Congressional disapproval) and there are limits on golden parachutes for executives whose companies participate in the program. We will help homeowners by allowing the government to change the terms of mortgages to help reduce the 2 million projected foreclosures in the next year. It will also assist school districts, cities and counties who held investments in failed institutions. 
   The bill temporarily raises the FDIC insurance cap to $250,000 from $100,000. It also includes three additional pieces of legislation that are critical to the health of our economy and our constituents. This legislation will extend tax credits and incentives that are important to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. It extends tax benefits to the renewable energy industry. Solar and wind energy, fuel cells, and biofuels are but a few of the technologies that will benefit from the legislation that we are considering today, and they will all play a role in our nation's energy future. While I remain committed to totally eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, this bill includes a ``one-year fix'' that will prevent an additional 25 million American taxpayers from being subject to the AMT on their 2008 tax returns and it will reduce or eliminate the AMT obligation for 121,033 tax filers in my Congressional District. Finally, the legislation includes the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which will provide for equity in the coverage of mental health and substance use disorders when compared to medical and surgical disorders. 
   The vote I took earlier this week was as tough as any I've ever taken during my time in Congress and today's vote will not be any easier. I will vote ``yes'' because I believe it's the right thing do for our country. 
   I believe doing nothing is a higher risk to our country and would hurt millions of Americans across the nation. I didn't come to Congress to hurt people. My ``yes'' vote is to help restore confidence in our economy, help move the country move forward, protect taxpayers, help Main Street, protect pensions, protect 401Ks, and restore our credit markets and, with no rewards for those whose greed and foolishness have so jeopardized our economy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentleman, who is our wonderful chairman of the Health Subcommittee in the House, for yielding. I want to begin by paying tribute to our colleagues, JIM RAMSTAD and PATRICK KENNEDY. They came to my congressional district for a hearing, and there was an outpouring. But, in addition, there was an outpouring across the country and I believe that they carried a candle across the country and that candle has lit the way. They lit the way with their integrity, with their courage, with their patience to listen, and their legislative craft of the bill that is brought before the House today. So to both of you, I salute you and the country thanks you. 
   America is best when we see where we have not done right, where there is a wrong, and we correct it. Congressman Kennedy said today that this is civil rights legislation, and it is. Every Member of the House should recognize that, today, we have the opportunity to break down a barrier, one of the last barriers in our country where those that have mental illness are indeed discriminated against in the insurance system of our country. 
   Now there are some in my congressional district that have led the way. Tony and Fran Hoffman helped to found the National Association of Mental Health. Eve Oliphant has worked for that. And I am really proud that David Wellstone, the late Senator Wellstone's son, is a constituent as well. 
   There are some very important points that have been made about the bill. There are also many things that have been thrown at it. For those that say that jet lag is going to be paid for by insurance companies, don't insult people that have mental health illnesses in our country. That will not happen. So, my colleagues, let's pass the civil rights legislation today. We will do the country good by doing so.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the H.R. 3997 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   Each of us is outraged about the circumstances that have brought our financial system to near collapse. In my view, this was brought on by the Bush administration's failed economic policies and their support for ``cowboy capitalism,'' believing the markets must be allowed to run free and unfettered. Instead, Wall Street has been allowed to run wild without accountability, without transparency and without effective enforcement or regulations to protect the American taxpayer. 
   The legislation the President presented to Congress on Monday, September 22, requested Congress to approve a $700 billion bailout, with the Treasury Secretary empowered to set the rules for all transactions. The bill included no safeguards, no transparency, no accountability, and no oversight. This plan was wrong for the American people and we rejected it. 
   Over the past week, legislation has been completely reshaped and it now includes three essential elements to rebuild our financial system. First, we will reinvest in troubled financial markets to stabilize our economy and insulate Main Street from Wall Street. Second, the taxpayer will be reimbursed through ownership shares and asset recovery as the plan begins to work. Finally, the bill will reform how business is done on Wall Street including the prohibition of golden parachutes. 
   This legislation ensures that taxpayers have an equity share in any profits and gives taxpayers an ownership stake and profit sharing of participating companies. It puts taxpayers first in line to recover assets if a participating company fails, and allows the Government to purchase troubled assets from pension plans, local government, and small banks that serve low- and middle-income families. 
   H.R. 3997 includes strong independent oversight and transparency through an establishment of an independent bipartisan board to provide oversight, review and accountability of taxpayer funds. The Government Accountability Office will have a presence at Treasury to oversee the program and conduct audits to ensure strong internal controls, and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. There will be an independent Inspector General to monitor the Treasury Secretary's decisions in regard to this program and all transactions will be posted online for the public to review. 
   Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once, the legislation gives the Treasury $250 billion immediately, then requires the President to certify that additional funds are needed, $100 billion, then $350 billion, subject to congressional disapproval, and there are limits on golden parachutes for executives whose companies participate in the program. We will help homeowners by allowing the Government to change the terms of mortgages to help reduce the 2 million projected foreclosures in the next year. It will also assist school districts, cities and counties who had investments in failed institutions. 
   I firmly believe if we do nothing, our ability to obtain home mortgages, car loans, student loans, loans for small businesses, or even credit cards will become highly difficult or impossible. Even more financial institutions could fail and millions could lose their pensions and retirement savings, thousands of jobs could be lost, and large parts of our economy could cease to function. The repercussions would be far greater than the cost of a financial rescue program. 
   This is as tough a vote as any I've ever taken during my time in Congress. Today, I will vote ``yes'' because I believe we've shaped a good bill which is fair to taxpayers and a plan to address the many critical issues plaguing the U.S. financial system. 
   Having said this, I know that no legislation is perfect; it is a product of human beings. But doing nothing I believe is a higher risk to our country and would hurt millions of Americans across the nation. I didn't come to Congress to hurt people. My ``yes'' vote is to help the country move forward, protect taxpayers, help Main Street, protect pensions, protect 401(k)s, and restore our credit markets and, with no rewards for those whose greed and foolishness have so jeopardized our economy.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, today we are living up to the promise we made at the beginning of the new Congress to bring discipline to the federal budget. 
   By passing this Resolution, we will take an important step toward balancing our nation's budget, begin generating a budget surplus by 2012, and provide resources for critical undertakings in our country. 
   It's been a long time since we've talked about budget surpluses. Back in 2001, a $5.6 trillion surplus was projected by 2011. In two short years, that surplus disappeared and instead $2.8 trillion was added to the national debt. It now stands today at more than $8.8 trillion. 
   Today we're turning the corner by upholding the principle of pay-as-you-go. Any new spending has to be offset by cuts to other parts of the budget and new tax cuts must be paid for. 
   This budget addresses several important national priorities: It provides relief to the middle-class from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which is causing an increasing number of Americans to absorb a higher tax burden, as well as imposing an enormous paperwork burden on taxpayers who must determine whether or not they have to pay this tax. In my Congressional District, 11 percent of taxpayers are subject to the AMT. On average, they pay $8,000 in additional taxes each year because of it. This budget allows for the extension of expiring middle-class tax provisions, including the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the 10-percent bracket, and the deduction for state and local sales taxes; it provides up to $50 billion to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover a million more uninsured children in our country. 
   Because we're committed to fiscal responsibility, each of these priorities will be paid for. 
   The budget also provides funding for priorities that have been neglected for too long: it provides $3 billion in additional funding for education, including the No Child Left Behind Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; it provides funding for the victims and communities devastated by Hurricane Katrina; it provides $5.4 billion for health care for veterans. 
   This Budget Resolution provides funding to carry forward the Innovation Agenda that House Democrats under Speaker PELOSI developed last year, a commitment to keep America #1 competitively by making major investments in education and research, and the Resolution delivers on this commitment: it puts us on the path toward doubling the funding for the National Science Foundation and basic research in the physical sciences; it supports important initiatives to educate 100,000 new scientists, engineers, and mathematicians and to ensure that highly qualified teachers are instructing elementary and secondary school students in science and math. 
   This budget is supported by a wide-array of scientists and innovators, including: 
   American Electronics Association (AeA) 
   American Chemical Society (ACS) 
   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 
   Association of American Universities (AAU) 
   Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) 
   Council on Competitiveness 
   Electronics Industry Association (EIA) 
   Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) 
   Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) 
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 
   National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) 
   National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC) 
   Science Coalition 
   Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) 
   TechNet. 
   Technology CEO Council 
   Mr. Chairman, I know it is not easy to create a budget that satisfies every need, but for the first time in years we have a budget that acknowledges fiscal realities and addresses our national priorities in a balanced and responsible manner. It is a worthy statement of our national values, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to commend Chairwoman DELAURO for her excellent work on this bill and to address a specific issue that is of growing importance to my constituents. 
   This March, the light brown apple moth (LBAM), an exotic pest native to Australia, was discovered in California. The moth has been damaging to growers in Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and San Mateo Counties in my district. In Santa Cruz County, nearly 6,000 moths have now been detected. 
   This pest can affect a wide variety of plants, flowers, fruits and vegetables, and virtually any crop with a leaf is a potential host. 
   In order to halt the spread of this pest, USDA has imposed a quarantine in California counties where the moth has been found. Growers in these counties must subject their operations to a visual inspection to demonstrate that their facilities are not infested before they can be cleared to ship produce. For growers within 1.5 miles of a confirmed discovery of the moth, each shipment must be cleared by an inspection. 
   Canada and Mexico have also placed restrictions on the import of California products. 
   The quarantine and restrictions are a burden on growers in my district as well as on State and county agriculture officials, but it is a burden they recognize is necessary to prevent the further spread of the light brown apple moth.  
   What is critical is adequate Federal support and funding for the eradication and inspection effort. The USDA provided $5 million for this effort at the outset and they are seeking an additional $12.5 million through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The request has been pending with OMB for several weeks now and it needs to be approved. 
   Even if the funding is released, it may only carry operations through the end of the year. In the coming years, it may take several million dollars more to ensure the job is complete. 
   This was a relatively late breaking issue to be addressed in this appropriations bill, and I commend Chairwoman DELAURO for recognizing how serious it is and for including report language that calls on the USDA to secure all funds needed from the Commodity Credit Corporation to eradicate the light brown apple moth. In the Senate, $1 million is included within the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) specifically for this purpose. 
   As we move forward with this bill and subsequent legislation to deal with agriculture disasters, I look forward to working with the Chairwoman and my colleague, Mr. FARR, to build on what is already in the House and Senate bills in order to ensure that sufficient funding is provided and that it is made available in a timely fashion.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act of 2008. 
   As the title of the bill makes clear, there is no greater threat to our economic or our national security than our dependence on fossil fuels. Our Nation is acknowledging something, and that is that we have an addiction to oil and that we are so totally dependent upon it. And who benefits from this addiction? Iran, Venezuela, Russia, rogue regimes. And they are all getting rich off our reliance on a 19th-century energy source. Today, we have an opportunity to strike a blow to some of the most dangerous regimes and promote American economic and American national security. And that's what this bill represents. 
   The simplistic and unconditional ``drill here, drill now'' rhetoric is not a real response to these challenges. It really falls short of what some of the great leaders of our Nation put forward at another time during the history of our country. 
   We have to lift ourselves up to end this dangerous addiction by developing renewable energy sources and become energy efficient. Solar panels, electric cars, fuel cells, efficient data centers and green buildings are all being developed by innovators in my congressional district in Silicon Valley. With these technologies, we can export energy to the world instead of being an importer of fossil fuels. 
   This bill is fully paid for--and I think my Republican friends need to listen up to this--by rolling back needless subsidies to the oil companies, and will develop a renewable energy industry, will create American jobs, will increase production, and will motivate investments in renewable energy through tax credits. 
   Oil is a necessary source in the near term, and the bill provides for responsible drilling. I think we need to protect our precious coastal regions. And with the offshore oil drilling moratorium expiring in a few weeks, our coast will be open to new leases.

   This bill is all about the future. Some, placing our country at risk, will choose the past, to stay with the past and to remain addicted. 
   This bill is a pathway to the future. I'm proud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to Mr. Barton's amendment. I believe that it will perpetuate a system of winners and losers in the allocation of Federal resources for AIDS. 
   When Congress reauthorized the Ryan White AIDS program last year, we included language to allow the historic epicenters of the disease to continue providing care to those in need. The language was specifically intended to protect against drastic cuts that would destabilize the existing infrastructure for HIV/AIDS care. 
   Now, my friend from Texas has been absolutely consistent, and so have I. He's always been opposed to what I've just described, and I have supported it. So it's gone back and forth. But we've both been consistent in terms of our positions. I obviously respectfully disagree with his amendment, because I think it's important to understand, number one, A, that you have to protect the infrastructure. This isn't simply, when we say the care of people, you have to have infrastructure for it. And I think, underlying the gentleman's amendment is the notion that dead people are being funded, and that simply is not the case. We are both on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We've debated it there, and that's why I'm bringing some of the flavor of what we've debated there. 
   Over 20,000 people have died from AIDS in San Francisco's EMA. That's the eligible metropolitan area. 
   Now, the gentleman from California that spoke just a few moments ago talked about his time on the Board of Supervisors. That's where I came from in San Mateo County. And San Mateo and the City and County of San Francisco have been partners in this. And it's what has really held up and helped to build the infrastructure to take very good care of people. We take it seriously. Every dollar in this, every dollar in this has an effect on human beings. So this is not some tidy formula that somehow is not going to affect the infrastructure. So that's another reason why I oppose this. 
   San Francisco's award for fiscal 2007 was cut by 31.4 percent, or $8.6 million. Now, in Federal money, $8.6 million, unfortunately, is not considered serious money. This is devastating in this EMA. I know of what I speak. I've been there on the ground. I see where the dollars go and what people get. 
   Now, several other jurisdictions also have received larger than anticipated cuts. So I don't believe that the HRSA properly interpreted these provisions and that this bill, very importantly, corrects that error. 
   The stop loss language does not prevent cuts. Instead, it reduces losses to levels that can be reasonably absorbed in one fiscal year. And that's really a very important operational phrase, ``reasonably absorbed in one fiscal year.'' 
   Any Member of Congress want to take a 31.4 cut in what their income is to help them take care of what they have to take care of their responsibilities and obligations? It's absurd. It's absurd. So that's why we are rising in opposition to the amendment. 
   So the language caps losses for the EMAs at 8.4 percent. And I think that this represents the 5 percent hold-harmless loss that was agreed to in last year's reauthorization. 
   I think the Barton amendment would prevent us from responding to the real needs of people that suffer from HIV and AIDS, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the very good work that he has done, all the members of the committee, because I know that you have to make difficult choices. 
   I am pleased to speak on the floor today about this investment in new technologies. As so many Members of the House know, I have the privilege of representing a congressional district that is the home of innovation and technology, high technology, biotechnology in our Nation. So perhaps the gentleman from Texas should come to visit because he would quickly come to respect what our country has come to rely on as well as our national economy. 
   I believe that this is a small but very important investment, and it will make vehicles more fuel efficient. I think this is not only a value of the people of my congressional district but of the entire Nation. 
   Our country today is paying too high a price for not being fuel efficient, not being energy efficient; and to add insult to injury, we are depending upon our opponents and in some cases our enemies to supply us. That is a policy that I believe is on its head, and so I was pleased to request of the committee that we make an investment in this technology. 
   Now, what does it do? It develops a new type of cost-effective, energy-efficient fuel cell for automobiles. Now, fuel cells, we know that they can dramatically improve mileage per gallon, but the downside is that they require platinum, and platinum is expensive and it is in short supply. But it is needed because it is the catalyst for these fuel cells. 
   This particular investment actually will go a long way to dramatically increase the surface area of the platinum in a fuel cell. In other words, it will bring down the price. In fact, this project that I have requested funding for promises to produce a one-third cut in the overall cost of the fuel cell. 
   Now, we are respected around the world for the investments that we have made collectively, public and private, in new technologies. It seems to me that this is cutting edge, that it is smart, and that it is wise.  
   I would like to make two broader observations. Number one, when I listen to the gentleman from Texas, he registers the complaints from his constituents. 
   You know what? You don't have a corner on the market of constituents that care about how we spend money. Of course these things should be scrutinized. I welcome it. 
   But when there is an overall public good here where all of the American people win, not just my constituents from the 14th District in California or the gentleman's district in Texas but all Americans, that is a good investment. 
   Number two, my constituents pay taxes, just like yours. And guess what? Californians don't get back everything that they send here. So are some things appropriate, good investments? We have to scrutinize that. But mine pay a fair share just as everyone else's do. As a matter of fact, California sends more than it gets back, which includes my constituents. 
   And I would like to add a final point, and my mother used to say this, and now her words, I think, are truer than ever: ``There are some that know the cost of everything but value nothing.''

   Ms. ESHOO. I will be as brief as possible so that we can get back to what was being debated. 
   I want to thank Mr. Obey for including $307 million for the Children's Graduate Medical Education Program. While this amount is less than the $330 million authorized by Congress last year, it is obviously a good improvement over the levels proposed by the President, which is $110 million, and the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is $200 million. 
   The reason I wanted to have the colloquy is to go on record, urge the chairman to do everything he can to not only maintain the House's funding level when the bill goes to conference, and perhaps even be able to do more. 
   I think that we all have a healthy understanding of what the Children's Hospitals GME represents. It has been an outstanding success. It is important to note that Children's Hospitals receive 80 percent of what other teaching hospitals receive on average from Medicare's Graduate Medical Education Program. 
   In recent years, Children's Hospitals have been able to sustain and improve their training programs so that the shortages of pediatric specialists in our country can be addressed. The program has also indirectly strengthened Children's Hospitals as premier pediatric  centers of excellence. They are the safety net for low-income children in their communities and they are the centers of pediatric research as well. 
   So I want to thank the chairman for everything he has done to fully fund the program this year, and I would be happy to yield to him.

   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the chairman. I also want to raise the issue about my strong support for increased funding for Health Information Technology, often referred to as Health IT. 
   The adoption, I believe, of electronic health record systems I think will have a profound effect on the health care delivery in our country. I believe it will enhance patient safety, reduce medical errors, and improve the quality of care. 
   For several years, the administration and the Congress have not committed enough funds to make this promise a reality in our country. I recognize the continued commitment to HIT that is in this year's Labor-HHS bill, $61 million, and I think we need to make a greater investment to make this a reality because it not only needs to be launched effectively, because we have to have interoperability, and without it we really won't have a Health IT system. 
   So I want to thank the committee, most especially the chairman, for weeding through what is really a difficult bill to put together because we are constrained moneywise. But if there is any opportunity at conference, I want to urge optimizing that possibility.

   The bill is important for ensuring the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and medical devices available to the American public. It includes necessary funding for vital FDA functions, such as drug and device review and approval, and also enhances post-market surveillance activities for these products. 
   I want to focus my remarks on the sections of the bill that renew the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). I championed the original enactments of these successful programs which have helped to increase the number of drugs tested and labeled for use in children, and I'm proud these programs will be renewed and further improved under this bill. 
   According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only about 25% of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested for use in kids. Pediatricians often have to prescribe drugs for ``off-label'' use, because the drug has not been studied in appropriate FDA-approved pediatric clinical trials. Children have specific medical needs that have to be considered when drugs are used. Children have died or suffered serious side effects after taking drugs that were shown safe for use in adults but had different results in children. 
   I've worked with stakeholders on all sides of this issue to update BPCA and PREA to increase the amount and quality of pediatric information available to doctors, parents, and researchers. I've also enhanced labeling and post-market safety requirements. The bill also makes permanent the FDA's authority to require pediatric studies of drugs, which is consistent with its permanent authority to require studies of adult formulations. Together, these changes will help to generate important new information about the safety and efficacy of drugs prescribed to children. 
   A coalition of children's groups has endorsed H.R. 2900. The bill was unanimously passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee before the July 4th Recess and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   In closing I want to thank the staff members who have worked exceedingly hard to bring this bill to the Floor today: John Ford, Bobby Clark, Pete Goodloe and Jack Maniko of the Energy and Commerce Committee Majority staff, Ryan Long and John Little of the Minority staff, and Jennifer Nieto from my office. 
   I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 2900 and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (BAY AREA REGIONAL WATER RECYCLING PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, first all my thanks to Representative GEORGE MILLER for his leadership and vision for sponsoring this legislation which I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of. 
   The legislation authorizes a total of seven new projects, including two in my district: the Mountain View Moffett Area Recycled Water Distribution Project and the Redwood City Recycled Water Project. 
   Since the 1990's a partnership of 17 local Bay Area governments, water, and wastewater agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the California Department of Water Resources have worked to maximize water recycling around the Bay under the auspices of the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program (BARWRP). They have been found by the Bureau of Reclamation to be feasible or close to achieving feasibility, and they're now ready to move into construction with significant local funding commitments consistent with the Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI water recycling program. Under the bill, the federal government may provide up to 25% of the cost of the planning, designing, and building each project, and the local sponsors will be responsible for securing at least 75 percent. 
   Despite the significant investments that communities have already made to these projects, they have not been able to secure federal funds because of a lack of investment by the Bureau of Reclamation in the Title XVI program and because of a lack of a specific Congressional authorization for these projects. This legislation addresses the question of authorization so that the funding may follow. 
   There's a clear federal interest in these water recycling projects since other federal water projects already contribute significant portions of the water supply to communities throughout the Bay Area. Taken together, the projects authorized in H.R. 1526 will conserve 5,000 acre-feet of potable water per year in the near-term (the first five years of operation) and more than 9,000 acre-feet per year over the long term (10 to 15 years). This represents 9,000 acre-feet which will not have to be extracted from the San Francisco Bay Delta, the Hetch Hechy system, and other sensitive areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, in coming years water supplies in California are going to be stretched and stressed by population growth, environmental stress, and supply reductions in water caused by the loss of snow pack due to global warming. If we're going to meet the challenge and relieve the stress on the existing system, we're going to need projects like these. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1526.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5. 
   In today's increasingly competitive economy, a college education is more important than ever. That's why it's essential for us to ensure that anyone who has the desire to receive a higher education has the opportunity to do so. Higher education shapes citizens as well as the future of our country. 
   Today escalating college costs and legislation passed by the Republican Majority in 2006 are creating insurmountable barriers across the country for students to afford a college education. According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial obstacles will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a four-year public college over the next decade. This is an inexcusable waste of our most valuable resource, the young people of our country. 
   H.R. 5 will lower these barriers, cutting interest rates in half over the next five years for undergraduate students with subsidized student loans. This relief is targeted to reach those most in need ..... students and families making between $26,000 and $68,000. When fully phased in, this legislation will save the typical borrower in California with $15,125 in subsidized federal student loan debt approximately $4,830 over the life of their loan. All told, this legislation will provide students with $5.5 billion in financial relief and is entirely paid for through adjustments in lender rates, participation fees for financial institutions and collection fees for defaulted loans. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. By doing so we will take an important step to improve access to higher education across the country as well as helping to relieve the burden on middle class families across the nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle for being here today to pay tribute to really a great and very good man, Leo McCarthy. 
   I had the pleasure of knowing Leo for many, many, many years. He was not only my mentor; he was my friend. He was dear to my family. But he inspired me in public service. I had the privilege of serving as his chief of staff of his district office, which was in San Francisco, at the time, and I learned so much from him. 
   There are so many times, my colleagues, that the closer we get in terms of view of someone, the less we may like what we see. With Leo McCarthy, the closer I got, the more I saw, the more my respect for him was deepened.     
   He was a man of the fullest integrity. He was an honest man. An honest man. And he made everyone proud of his service to people not only in his beloved city of San Francisco but in the entire State of California. I think he helped to make California more golden of a State. 
   He was a policy wonk. He knew exactly why he had gone into government service. In all of his years serving on the board of supervisors in the city and county of San Francisco to his election to the assembly, the California Assembly, to his elevation as Speaker of the California Assembly, and then the time that he served as Lieutenant Governor, political writers, the people that he served, the counties throughout our State, 58 counties and the people that live in them, knew that Leo McCarthy's word was golden, that he was there to serve them and that that is what motivated him. 
   He was a great family man. All the years that he served in Sacramento, he drove home every single evening to be with his family in San Francisco. It was really the measure of the man. The love of his life was Jackie McCarthy, and he always said that she did the hard work because she was at home raising four extraordinary children: Sharon, Conna, Niall, and Adam. I wish all of my colleagues could have heard these four adults pay tribute to their father at St. Ignatius Church at the magnificent funeral mass that was in celebration of his good life. 
   He was a man filled with faith, and he served at a very early time in the minor seminary. And he said to me one day, Anna, that didn't last too long. And I responded to him, Leo, it lasted a lifetime. Because he blended his faith with the service that he gave to people and he was rooted in it. 
   When he left public life, he went on, and in the latter years of his all too short life, I think, I always wanted Leo to live forever, he founded a center at the University of San Francisco, his alma mater that he loved so much. And during the funeral mass, the Jesuits paid tribute to him. There must have been 30 Jesuits on the alter, the archbishop of San Francisco, the former bishop of Oakland, and the auxiliary bishop, John Westor, all there to pay tribute to Leo McCarthy. That Center for Public Service and the Common Good spoke of Leo's desire to help students get involved in public policy at the State, at the Federal, and the local levels. 
   Leo McCarthy had a singular friend that loved him in unquestioned ways. He was his aid when Leo first went to Sacramento as a member of the State legislature. He then was elected in his own right to the State legislature. He then went on to become the mayor of San Francisco. And that man is Art Agnos. Every single day of Leo's too long illness, which marked all of last year, and at all other times in his life but especially during that difficult time, Art Agnos was by Leo's bedside every day, every night. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by thanking all the members of the committee for passing the resolution. It will mean a great deal to the family. I thank Josh Andrews in my office. I thank all of my colleagues. I know this will mean a great deal to the family. 
   And I say to whomever is listening in, God rest Leo McCarthy's noble soul.

   In listening to my colleague from California, he talked about technology, and I think I know something about it. I represent the place, Silicon Valley, which is the home of innovation and technology for our Nation and the world, but this isn't just a matter of how. This is a matter of who, of who. 
   Now, for the American people that are tuned in, what is this debate about? We all know that there are sworn enemies of our country. There are those that would do us harm and do us in, and every President of the United States deserves the best intelligence. We take an oath to protect our country and also to protect our Constitution. 
   So where's the dispute here? The dispute is that this bill allows the Attorney General, without any legal framework, when someone from outside the country calls, our government can monitor you, and we are saying that this is an abrogation of rights that we have. 
   This side, what we have fought for all along is to protect our country, protect our Constitution and have a legal framework. This is the administration that had to acknowledge that they were operating outside the law. This is the Attorney General that has disgraced himself, his office and the department with how he has conducted himself. Most frankly, this should not be a matter of trust of individuals. This should be a matter of legal framework, a matter of law, and this bill does not accomplish it.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank our very distinguished, wonderful chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. 
   We are here this evening for one reason and one reason only: it is to override the President's veto of the House authorization for the intelligence community. And the reason, the stated reason, and the President said so, the reason he vetoed the bill is because he is for torture. T-o-r-t-u-r-e. It's what the President said. 
   This is a very sad, dark moment for our country that a President of the United States would remove all of the tools that we've provided for the intelligence community in a post-9/11 world and say, Because you don't allow torture, I'm not for the bill. 
   Now, the President's position is entirely inconsistent with our Nation's history. The United States of America has long accepted that torture is beneath the standard of a civil nation. In 1947, the United States prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of water torture on a U.S. civilian. The military has frequently prosecuted American military personnel for subjecting prisoners to torture since the Spanish-American War. 
   Our Nation was able to win two world wars and defeat a rising tide of communism with a torture prohibition in place. And I think that we can defeat America's enemies today without lowering ourselves, without allowing ourselves to become the organizers against us. That's what we have done. And we have not only degraded ourselves but helped to chip away at the magnificent credibility of our great Nation that people before us provided, and now we stand on their shoulders. And a President of the United States vetoes a bill because he stands for torture. We should slam that door shut. 
   And the way we do it is by overriding this President's veto. There isn't any room in our country for this. And for anyone to describe these things as being sissies because you stand against torture, that is really shameful. That's really shameful, with all due respect. 
   This is a tough position. It's the right position. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto because that veto was about torture.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member, the chairman of the House Science and Space Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans of my generation and my parents' generation as well have always accepted it as an article of faith that the United States of America would lead the world in innovation, in ingenuity, and in invention. And, no matter what the challenge would be, that we as a Nation would rise to that test, we would meet the competition, and we would come out on top. 
   It was true in the 1930s, when President Roosevelt responded to the concerns of scientists in our country about the Nazi government and what they might develop with the Manhattan Project. It was true in 1961, when America awoke to the fact that a Soviet cosmonaut had been launched into space, and President Kennedy responded by saying as a Nation we have to commit ourselves to achieving the goal that, before the decade was out, that we would land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. And we did when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969 and took a giant leap for mankind. 
   We know that there is a gathering storm when it comes to innovation and competition for our country, and that is what this legislation directs itself to. 
   We have to perform. We have to produce more scientists, more mathematicians, educate our children, invest in science, and research. That is what this bill is about. 
   I have an optimistic view of America. I don't share the somewhat depressed view that the distinguished minority leader offered. We can, we have in the past, we will in the future. This legislation today helps to lay the groundwork for our sure economic footing so that the 21st century is an American century.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Kingston Amendment which would strike language from the bill to implement a fundamental change to the FDA's drug safety laws by allowing the commercial re-importation of prescription drugs. 
   The bill is a vast expansion of current policy. Besides allowing individuals to bring drugs across the border for their personal use, the bill would allow pharmacists and wholesalers to re-import prescription drugs for sale in the U.S. 
   Let me address the myth that allowing prescription drug reimportation will dramatically reduce drug costs for Americans. This has never been proven and according to a 2004 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated savings to individuals would be less than 1 percent. I'm concerned about taking serious risks to patient health for little or no gain. 
   It's important to remember why prescription drug re-importation was banned in the first place. Nearly 20 years ago, Congressman John Dingell introduced and passed the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. He did so on the heels of a multi-year investigation by the Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. 
   The Subcommittee's investigation uncovered a string of abuses that were harming patients, including widespread importation of counterfeit drugs, drugs that had been tampered with and drugs that were incorrectly dosed or wrongly labeled. It showed that wholesalers who brought drugs back into the U.S. had no idea where the drugs originated, who they were buying them from and whether they were stored properly. 
   These problems have only worsened in the years that have followed. In 2003 the FDA and Customs Service found that 88 percent of imported medicines entering the U.S. were unapproved or otherwise illegal. 
   Mr. Chairman, the FDA is already a beleaguered and underfunded agency, a fact which was borne out by the recent incidents involving the importation of dangerous food and drug products from abroad, including tainted dog food and toothpaste, and Congress continues to struggle to find revenue for this vital agency. To require the FDA to take on the additional mandate of policing imported drugs will only place additional burdens on an already strapped agency. 
   I understand the concern of many of my colleagues about the cost of prescription drugs, particularly for elderly Americans, and I believe there are ways to address these issues without endangering public health. We cannot and should not jeopardize the safety of our rug supply on the unproven mechanism of re-importation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting YES on the Kingston Amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to provide minimum ``dwell-time'' for our troops who have served in Iraq. 
   Madam Chairwoman, I opposed the war in Iraq from the outset and will continue to do so. 
   In 4 years, the war has done great damage to our global prestige, our national morale, and our national security. More than anything, it has damaged our military and their families. 
   It is Congress's duty to ensure that our troops are treated with respect and that they have resources for the missions they perform. Equally important, it is Congress's job to ensure our troops have the rest and training they need. With this bill, we will do right by our military personnel and their families by ensuring they have adequate time at home between deployments. 
   The Defense Department has established a goal to provide active duty service personnel  with 2 years at home between each year they are deployed, and 5 years at home for every year of deployment for reserves. 
   Regrettably that goal has not been achieved. In fact, the policy has been waived by the Defense Department for those serving in Iraq. 
   In the last 4 years our troops and reserves have shouldered the burden of multiple deployments overseas with professionalism and courage. The strain on them and their families grows with each day they are away from home, yet tours of duty have been extended time and again. Just this past April, Secretary Gates announced that tours of duty for the Army would be increased from 12 months to 15 months. 
   The strain is not only being felt by our troops and their families, it's also affected the Armed Forces, particularly the Army, in meet recruiting and retention goals. 
   With this bill, we call for time between deployments for active-duty personnel in Iraq to equal to or exceed the length of their most recent deployment. For National Guard and Reserve units and members, the bill calls for time between deployments of at least three times longer than the length of their most recent deployment. 
   This may seem like a small step, but for our troops it's essential. 
   I urge my colleague to vote yes on this bill.

I am proud to support it, and I think that this is a very important moment for the Congress. Why? Because this bill really represents hope for the American people. 
   I often say to my constituents that I am in the business of hope, to give hope to people with what I do and the vote that I cast. There is a reason why this bill is an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, because 72 percent of the American people support stem cell research. 
   There is only one type of stem cell research that is not funded by the Federal Government today and that is embryonic stem cell research. There are tax dollars for all the others: for cord blood, for amniotic, and for adult. That is why we have the bill before us today. 
   We all have constituents, we all have members of our families that have diseases that have befallen them and injuries that have befallen them and where they come to us and say, please, take action on this. So as someone that considers herself in the business of hope, I am especially proud to not only be a part of this effort but also be part of a new Congress that is giving hope to  people that a Congress will take action on those things that are really relevant to people in their day-to-day lives: that the American people, the working people of our country, be given a raise in the minimum wage; that people across this country will be given substantial hope that we will take action on this bill; and that, hopefully, the President will continue the line of hope by changing his mind and signing the legislation into law.

   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I'm proud to have sponsored this Resolution to establish a National 9-1-1 Education Month. 
   Forty years ago President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Justice recommended that a single, nationwide telephone number be established for reporting emergencies--9-1-1. Since then, 9-1-1 has been used by millions of people across the country to quickly and efficiently contact their local fire and police departments, as well as report emergencies in their communities. Over 200 million emergency calls are made each year through the 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering points serving more than 3,000 counties. 
   As the connection between the eyes and ears of the public and the emergency response system in the U.S., 9-1-1 answering points are often the first to know of emergencies caused by natural disasters, to national security threats, making 9-1-1 a vital homeland security asset. Educating people of all ages and backgrounds about 9-1-1 is crucial to the effectiveness of our emergency response system. It is especially important for vulnerable populations like children, the deaf and the hard of hearing, and those with limited English skills to understand and use.

   Front and center, that's what this bill does, it accomplishes both. It gives the intelligence community the most flexible tools for our professionals for their surveillance of terrorists and other necessary targets overseas. It accomplishes that. It safeguards our constitutional rights by requiring the FISA Court to approve targeting and minimization standards at the front end, when no emergency exists and to assure that Americans are not targeted. 
   It protects the private sector by providing prospective liability protection for telecommunications companies that provide lawful assistance to the government, and it provides those companies a way to present their defenses  in secure proceedings, in district court, without the administration using state secrets to block those defenses. 
   These are the most critical tools and safeguards, and that's why Members of Congress can be assured that they will be taking all the right steps by supporting this bill.

   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I've been working on 911 issues for over a decade. We've come a long way during this time, and this bill is another step toward full interoperability. It is essential for our constituents to have access to emergency services whether they're using a mobile phone or using a VOIP service. Confidence that our network will be able to access emergency services when they are needed is fundamental. 
   My thanks to Representative GORDON and the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this 911 legislation which I'm a cosponsor of. The bill places a duty on VOIP services to provide 911 for their customers. This gives customers a guarantee that they will have emergency services when they need it. Importantly, this legislation requires that carriers allow VOIP providers to interconnect with  their facilities. In return, carriers will be compensated at the same rate that wireless carries pay to interconnect. This interconnection mandate is necessary so that consumers will have timely access to 911 services. 
   This legislation will connect the 98 million Americans that live in areas where VOIP providers do not yet have access to the 911 network and are unable to receive reliable VOIP 911 services. 
   My colleague Mr. SHIMKUS and I are co-chairs of the E-911 Caucus and I thank him for his terrific work on this issue. We've worked closely together and passed legislation to provide federal grants to enhance our emergency communications system. So far no funding has been appropriated for this purpose but we were successful in passing an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations that added $5 million for this grant program. The funding ``plants the seed'' for advanced E-911 equipment so necessary in our communities. 
   This is a good bill and I strongly support it and urge Members to vote for it.

   Ms. ESHOO. I want to first begin by saluting our colleague, LOUISE SLAUGHTER, and Mrs. Biggert, who has worked so hard on this. This is really all about the future, except we had to struggle for 13 years in order to recognize it. But today, we do. And it is a singular extraordinary achievement, not only on the watch of Chairwoman Slaughter, but today for the full House to pass this legislation. 
   We know that in the makeup of our humanity is a genetic profile. Researchers and scientists have demonstrated what the potential is if in fact, not only through the human genome project, the sequencing, and the discovery of all that is hidden in it, what that portends for humanity. But there's another side of this, and that is a darker side. The darker side is entitled: Discrimination. That if that information, our genetic makeup is used by insurers to discriminate against people. 
   So today what we are doing is eliminating that block, that discrimination that stands in the way of the fullness of the potential of our genetic profile and how it can be not only accumulated but used to the benefit of humanity. That is what this legislation represents. 
   When we pass it and the President signs it into law, this legislation will not only end the discrimination and all that is attendant to it, but that from this day forward the principles of preventive medicine, the reduction of health care costs, the advancement of research, and the saving of lives will be the order of the day.

   Ms. ESHOO. My other observation is that the case being made by our friends on the Republican side really states very fully that you are on the wrong side of history. What this bill does is to give women the tools that they need legally so that an employer can no longer discriminate against them. 
   Have any of you heard of Lilly Ledbetter, of that case and what happened to that woman?

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. What this bill does is it says to employers today that you cannot punish employees any longer who discuss or disclose salary information with their coworkers. I think that is a pretty important thing. This bill also says today that employers will have to give a satisfactory explanation for paying a man more than a woman for the same job, and that they are going to have to demonstrate that the disparity is not sex-based, but job related. 
   So, today we are trying to even out the playing field. I think if my mother were sitting up there, she would be applauding. I think that mothers and daughters and fathers and grandparents and legislators and people across the country today, the last day of the month, are saying that the last now are going to come first, and we know in our society that women have not come first. Today we are talking about the waitress. We are talking about what Mr. Andrews talked about, and that is the woman that heads up the office. We are talking about the Lilly Ledbetters.

   Ms. ESHOO. So today I think that we are making the Union stronger and better by recognizing that there have been disparities and by recognizing the way we fix the disparities, and I salute those who have been on this effort for a long, long time. 
   America, it is a good day, July 31st, 2008, in the House of Representatives, thanks to Rosa DeLauro rewriting history, Chairman Miller for pushing it the way he has, and thank God for the Speaker that makes all of this possible, Nancy Pelosi.  
   I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act and I salute Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Miller for their important leadership to bring us to this day. 
   With the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act the Congress will make the Equal Pay Act a more effective tool in combating gender-based pay discrimination. 
   Today, if an employer can name any factor that has determined an employee's pay other than gender, they can defend unequal pay in  pay discrimination cases. The employer's reason doesn't even need to be related to the job in question. Under H.R. 1338 employers will have to give a satisfactory explanation for paying a man more than a woman for the same job and they will have to demonstrate that the disparity is not sex-based, but job related. 
   Employers will also now be barred from punishing employees who discuss or disclose salary information with their co-workers. 
   Under current law women who have been discriminated against may only recover back pay or in some cases double back pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act will finally put gender-based discrimination on the same level as other forms of wage discrimination by giving women the opportunity to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. 
   The wage gap between men and women has narrowed since the passage of the landmark Equal Pay Act in 1963, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau, women still only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. it's time to close the gap and pass this law. 
   I'm very proud to support this bill and I urge a yes vote on the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Education Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, today is a very exciting day. I don't think there is any feeling that beats coming to the floor and knowing that success awaits us and the American people. I think that's the case today as we gather to support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, known as GINA. 
   Many times over the course of American history in this Chamber, discrimination has been struck down. I believe that is what we are doing here today with this bill. When the sequencing of the Human Genome Project was completed in April of 2003, it was a great, great victory in the scientific community. So many of us understood what the implications were for our constituents, for the people of our Nation, and people in the world. 
   Researchers identified genetic markers for a variety of chronic health conditions. When they did, they threw open the doors to increase the potential for early treatment and prevention of numerous diseases. 
   But there was something that stepped in the way, and that was the threat of discrimination against anyone that subjected themselves to the test, found that they had a gene that wasn't perfect, which I think is the potential of every single one of us, and as a result of that, that their job would be threatened, and that their health care insurance could be dropped. What this bill does today is to throw the doors open with a guarantee by making it illegal for health plans and health insurers to deny coverage to a healthy individual or charge a higher premium based solely on genetic predisposition to a specific disease. 
   I could go on and on about the bill, but the fact of the matter is, it has well over 200 cosponsors. It is a real bipartisan bill. Thank you to Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER for her tenacity and her belief in the effort. Twelve years, that is a long time. 
   I would also like to say what a difference a new majority makes, because this bill was really blocked from coming to the floor for full consideration. To Representative Biggert, she has been just as tenacious as LOUISE SLAUGHTER, to all of my colleagues that have worked on this, to the chairman, Mr. George Miller of California, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Rangel, for making sure that they saw this through and, Ms. Slaughter, of course, she slaughtered us all, I tell you, on this, she made sure, and to the inspirational Dr. Francis Collins, who testified over and over again what the possibilities were that awaited the American people.  
   I pay tribute to all of you. It's a great day here in the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee and the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about and address what we accomplished at the beginning of this year in the 110th Congress. At that time in January, we came together on a bipartisan basis and a bicameral basis, with Mr. Goodlatte as well as, I think, the Father of the Internet tax moratorium effort, Senator Ron Wyden. What we did was to launch an effort that would be bipartisan and that would capture the position that the House of Representatives has always taken, and that is that there would be a permanent moratorium on access taxes on the Internet. 
   Now, what do ``access taxes'' mean? The term is thrown around. I really think that there are some that don't even understand what that means. Just think of the following: Every time you walk into a public library, how would you like to have to pay an access fee? Well, it's the same thing that would apply to the Internet. Every time you click on, you would be taxed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think there are hundreds of reasons why we stand in opposition to that. I think it's why when I was in the minority, I was always an original lead on the legislation, and now, as the majority, I am the lead on this bill. It is why we have attracted over 240 cosponsors to the legislation. It is not what the House Judiciary, unfortunately, passed out. 
   I don't think it is good public policy. Why do I say that? I don't say that simply because I feel like coming to the floor to say it. This is about commerce in our country. We want to broaden broadband in our country. I think that a permanent ban really speaks to that, a permanent moratorium. I also think that it demonstrates our commitment to the entire Internet community, that access to the Internet will remain tax free. 
   We also want to ensure that e-commerce will remain free of discriminatory taxes. Instead, the legislation is before us today on a suspension and I can't offer an amendment, because if I was able to offer an amendment, it would be permanent. We all know that. So I am very disappointed with what the Judiciary Committee came out with. I think that the best public policy is a permanent moratorium. I think it would serve the best interest of the people of our country, not just the Internet community, but all the people of our country. I also understand that some unions have a problem with permanence. Of all groups, they should be, in my view, protecting their workers who earn less and not have to pay an access fee. 
   So I regret that the House position today has really been diminished, because I don't think this is the fullness of what we can do. I think we can do much better. I really don't know the reason for a 4-year moratorium, why we have fallen back to that position. But I want to make very clear that very few bills have attracted 240-plus bipartisan cosponsors. I think that is the most eloquent statement about making the moratorium permanent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time that the gentleman has yielded to me, as well as Mr. Watts for seeking to give me more time. I hope that in the not-too-distant future that ``permanent'' will be the full position of the House of Representatives, the Congress of the United States, and that we put this behind us so that the country can move forward with a public policy that is going to serve everyone so much better than what is at hand.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the amended legislation that's before us. Two weeks ago when the House brought legislation to the floor on Internet taxation, I was only one of two that opposed it. Now, I opposed it not because I opposed extending the moratorium. Quite to the contrary. 
   I offered legislation with Mr. Goodlatte that would have made Internet taxation, a ban on it, permanent. We introduced legislation that enjoyed over 240 bipartisan cosponsors. That legislation was not considered by the Judiciary Committee or the House. 
   The bill also contained a loophole that could have opened up the possibility of new taxes on the Internet services such as e-mail and music downloading. I knew we could do better and today we are. 
   The Senate-amended legislation will establish the longest term for the Internet tax moratorium since it was first created in 1998. The Congress acted on that again in 2001 and 2004, and today's moratorium is the longest that will be adopted. So I think it's cause for celebration. 
   The legislation will guarantee that new barriers created by taxation of Internet access and e-commerce will not emerge when the current moratorium ends, which is just, as the chairwoman said, 36 hours away. So we're coming in right under the wire. 
   I think that this is very important policy for our country. Very importantly, this is going to continue to spur innovation, and it will advance our goal of broadband for everyone in the United States. 
   I'm very, very pleased at the Senate action, under the leadership of really the father of this effort, Senator RON WYDEN, new father of twins, a son and a daughter, many congratulations to him. I urge all of my colleagues. This should be a 100 percent vote in the House for a 7-year moratorium, and I thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor and the chairwoman for her leadership on this as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Dingell, for his leadership on this issue and so many others. 
   There are two things that relate to health care that absolutely mystify me. The first is that any President, this President, would oppose insuring children in the United States of America. Fought that, fought that, fought that, would not expand and add 10 million children to the health care rolls in our country. I don't understand any President of the United States doing that. 
   And today, we are here to override his veto. Imagine, vetoing a bill that allows seniors to have doctors take care of them. It's one heck of a way to gut Medicare. There isn't any Medicare unless there are doctors to treat the patients. In this case, it is the seniors of our country. 
   I am proud that Republicans and Democrats are coming together to provide the vote to override that bad, bad idea. And it serves the country well because when we invest in our people, whether they are children or seniors, we strengthen our Nation. 
   I thank God for EDWARD KENNEDY and showing his tenacity to get up out of his sick bed to cast that vote which then injected some iron in the spine of Members of Congress. So I join with my colleagues gladly and proudly today to override the President's veto in order to sustain Medicare, to save money, but more importantly than anything else, to invest in their precious lives and to celebrate that generation that all of us hail that made America so strong and so good. Thank you, Congress, for providing the votes to do so.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, we've read and seen on the news the accounting of numerous deaths following the anti-government protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The proindependence protests were initiated by ethnic Tibetans commemorating the 49th anniversary of the failed 1959 uprising that sent the Dalai Lama into exile. China is now facing mounting international pressure, including the U.S., to demonstrate restraint in dealing with the dissent. 
   I support the aspirations of the Tibetan people to peacefully protest for independence and safeguard their distinct identity by promoting the elimination of all forms of racial, religious, and linguistic discrimination against them. The People's Republic of China, PRC, has failed miserably to guarantee the preservation of these rights for the Tibetan people and as a result, Tibetans remain plagued by poverty, illiteracy, and a limited infrastructure. 
   I was privileged to participate in the Speaker's congressional delegation to India last month when we visited the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala. During our visit we discussed the tragic violence that has been taking place in Tibet with the Dalai Lama and we agreed that an open dialogue with the PRC and international pressure are the most effective methods at our disposal for ending the crisis. 
   This resolution was born out of those discussions with the Dalai Lama. It condemns the government of the PRC for its bloody suppression of the Tibetan people and calls on the government of the PRC to invite the Dalai Lama to China for the purpose of dialogue to resolve the root causes of unrest in the Tibetan areas of China. 
   Free expression and the right to dissent are defining elements of a democracy. That's why it is essential for us to speak out in condemnation of China's repression of religion, its complicity in the Sudanese atrocities in Darfur and its oppression of Tibet. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman. 
   Mr. Murtha, it is wonderful to see you in the chair.  
   I rise as a proud cosponsor of this legislation, which is really going to complete the outstanding work of the 9/11 Commission. 
   The issue that I want to focus my remarks on today is one that my colleagues and I have worked very hard on on a bipartisan basis on the Energy and Commerce Committee for many years, and that is how to guarantee real communication interoperability between first responders. This is a very, very important issue for all of our first responders and our communities. The fact is that interoperability can be solved today. Advanced technology developed across the United States and certainly in my district in the Silicon Valley can successfully enable first responders and others to communicate using disparate communication devices and networks. The problem up to this point has been a lack of resources and guidance from the Federal Government as to where and how local first responders should invest their scarce dollars to achieve this solution. 
   The bill before us addresses this problem by establishing a stand-alone grant program within the Department of Homeland Security devoted to establishing an interoperability framework that local authorities can work from. What is of utmost importance in creating this new grant program is the need to ensure technology neutrality so that the best available solution, whether it be radio, software or IP network-based, can be implemented as soon as possible. 
   So with this in mind, Mr. Speaker, I would like to at this time yield to my colleague, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, to ask if he agrees that the goal and the intent of this legislation is to guarantee that our efforts to fund interoperability solutions are indeed technology neutral. Specifically, the term ``equipment'' as used in the legislation should not be interpreted to exclude important technology such as software, middleware or network-based IP solutions.

   I rise in support of H. Res. 35. And I believe that for all of us on both sides of the aisle that this is a moment of high responsibility. 
   If there is anything that we became painfully aware of, it was that we did not have a seamless operation, intelligence operation, to help protect our country. So what we are debating and discussing here are not a handful of sentences. What we are doing is we are blending, for a very important reason, the power of the purse and the power of the policy. They can no longer stand as independent smokestacks, number one. 
   Number two, I ask all of my colleagues of the House, could the abuse and corruption that was done unto the budget survive the scrutiny of what we are proposing here, where a member of the Intelligence Committee committed those crimes? 
   So this is a moment of really high responsibility. I welcome ideas from both sides of the aisle. They are always important. But I think the overriding principles here are really what have been stated by so many, including the comments that I am making. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I welcome, I welcome more oversight. The problem with intelligence relative to the Congress is there has been undersight or no sight, and that is dangerous for our country. 
   So I support these reforms. I think that they are very important. It is a  moment of high responsibility for the Congress, and I salute the Speaker as well as the chairman of the committees of jurisdiction for bringing this much-needed legislation before the House, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, today is the second time we are voting to override the President's veto of legislation which provides health care to more low-income, uninsured children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). 
   Last year, 64 percent of the House voted for this legislation--just a handful of votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override. In the Senate, there is a sufficient ``super majority'' to pass this bill. 
   With the economy either in recession or on the threshold of one, the arguments for this bill are even greater than they were when we voted for it last year. 
   Unemployment is edging up. With more Americans out of work there will be an increase in the number of uninsured. For every point that unemployment rises, 1.2 million to 1.5 million Americans lose their health insurance. 
   This legislation increases to 10 million the number of children covered under SCHIP and it addresses almost every major concern that has been raised about the bill. 
   The bill covers only American citizens (not undocumented individuals). 
   The bill will cover only children, not adults. 
   The bill focuses on covering low-income kids and it caps eligibility to families earning less than $51,500. 
   The bill makes certain that coverage under SCHIP will not substitute for coverage by employer-provided and private health insurance. 
   The bill is fully paid for with an increase in the tobacco tax. This step not only balances the books, it saves lives and improves the health of young people. Public health experts (including a panel of the Institute of Medicine) agree that raising tobacco taxes is an effective way to reduce smoking, especially among children, and it's unfortunate that this provision is strongly opposed by the tobacco industry and the President. 
   With economic uncertainty facing millions of Americans at this time, I hope we will finally provide families with more security by overriding the President's veto and enacting this bill.

   Ms. ESHOO. I thank the distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation very importantly covers espionage, terrorism, sabotage and all threats to our national security. That sentence alone frames what this issue is about and the seriousness of it. 
   The other part of it that fills out the frame is that it restores the FISA Court. It restores the FISA Court to its prominence, and, by doing so, it restores a legal framework for surveillance that must be conducted to protect our national security. 
   This legislation provides every meaningful tool of the legislation that was passed last August. But, unlike that bill, it protects the rights of the American people. 
   The legislation is true to its name. It restores the role for all three branches of our government by reestablishing the checks and the balances that have protected our security, as well as our rights as Americans. This is what the American people not only expect, it is what they have become accustomed to, and they like it. 
   This legal framework for the NSA surveillance is absolutely essential. When no Americans are involved, no judicial oversight is required. When an American communication may be intercepted, the court must approve the procedures for handling it. Finally, when an American is targeted, the court must be asked for an order. 
   The American people know all too well that this administration is now considered the most secretive in the history of our country. It has operated with unchecked power and without judicial or congressional oversight. We now know that the President went around the courts to conduct a program of warrantless surveillance of calls to Americans. We now know that the FBI abused the authorities granted under the PATRIOT Act improperly using National Security Letters to American businesses, including medical, financial and library records, instead of seeking a warrant from the court. In hundreds of signing statements, the President has quietly claimed he had the authority to set aside statutes passed by Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think enough is enough. This bill says that the executive is not the imperial branch of government. It restores the fundamental balance struck by our Framers, to secure our Nation and to protect the rights of all Americans. Preserving that balance makes our Nation stronger, and this is at the core of the legislation before us. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation which I am proud to cosponsor, and I congratulate Chairman BERMAN for his exceptional leadership and on this complex issue. 
   I am proud to represent Silicon Valley, which is known worldwide for the innovation and developing technologies that continue to change and improve our lives. Nowhere in America--nowhere in the world--are ideas, invention, and intellectual property more important. 
   Patents and IP are the cornerstone of the Information Economy, and it is essential that the United States patent system continue to foster the ideas and innovation which fuel our economy and keep America competitive. 
   The patent system, unfortunately, has been subject to abuse, and unscrupulous opportunists have exploited the rights granted to legitimate patent holders to target innovative companies and file groundless lawsuits based on dubious patents. 
   The rapid pace of innovation and increasingly complex patent filings have strained the Patent and Trademark Office and patent claims of questionable validity have been granted. 
   Loopholes and shortcomings in the disposition of patent cases also allow baseless claims of infringement to create unnecessary litigation and extort nuisance settlements, sapping billions from economic growth, and creating a drag on real innovation. 
   Technology companies have become particularly enticing targets for this litigation because of the broad importance of patents to technology products. Just a single piece of high-tech equipment can contain hundreds of patents, and any one of them can now be used to sue for the value of the entire product. 
   One company in Silicon Valley--Cisco Systems--spent $45 million this year to defend patent infringement cases. 
   It is time to implement reforms to the patent system and ensure that we reward truly novel ideas and cutting edge innovation, not successful litigation strategies. 
   This bipartisan legislation enjoys broad support throughout the technology industry, major universities including the University of California, as well as major consumer groups such as Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and U.S. PIRG. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill which will restore balance to our patent system.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act. 
   This has been called the ``Year of the Recall'' because there's been a complete failure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to keep harmful and sometimes lethal products from getting on the shelves. Red tape, lax enforcement, and a shortage of resources at the CPSC have contributed to the recent recalls. It's not a coincidence that 25.6 million toys were recalled from stores in fiscal year 2007, compared with only 5 million toys in 2006. Things are falling through the cracks at the CPSC, and it's the American consumers, especially children, who are suffering. 
   It's become glaringly obvious that we can't rely on manufacturers to police themselves, we need to give our chief consumer regulatory agency the authority and the resources to get unsafe products off the shelves. 
   This bill is a significant improvement in product safety from the way we're operating now. It provides additional funding to the CPSC and bolsters the commission's ability to test and identify dangerous products. It also authorizes State Attorneys General to bring action on behalf of their residents to enforce federal consumer safety rules. 
   H.R. 4040 reduces lead levels in children's products, but in my view it doesn't go far enough. The amendment I offered in committee would have brought lead levels to 40 parts per million, the standard recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's my hope that the CPSC will take seriously its authority to adopt a more protective standard if it makes the determination that it is feasible and protective of human health. 
   I'm proud that my amendment to give the CPSC mandatory recall authority is included in the bill. This is an important tool for the CPSC to wield against the most nefarious companies who resist a recall of their faulty products. 
   I support this bipartisan bill to protect American consumers, especially children, and ask my colleagues to support it as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my legislation, H.R. 1283, the Arthritis Prevention, Control, and Cure Act. I have fought long and hard for this bill, along with the Arthritis Foundation, the American College of Rheumatology, and the thousands of advocates across the country that understand the need for this legislation. 
   With 1 out of 5 adults suffering from arthritis, this debilitating condition is the most common cause of disability in the United States. More than 300,000 children suffer from juvenile arthritis--more than the number of children with juvenile diabetes yet we have a severe shortage of pediatric rheumatologists in our country with only 239 nationwide and 11 states without even one. Early diagnosis for this disease is crucial and without it, thousands of children go undiagnosed because they don't have access to the right doctor. 
   This bill addresses the shortage through loan reimbursements for doctors who go into pediatric rheumatology, an increase in research of juvenile arthritis, and State grants for comprehensive arthritis programs and public health outreach. 
   I'm very proud to see the Arthritis Prevention, Control, and Cure Act on the floor today and I look forward to seeing the Senate companion, sponsored by my dear friend Senator KENNEDY, pass the other body as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank our distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. 
   I have listened very, very intently to the discussion on the floor this evening, as well as the news programs that have covered the debate about the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as well as participated in the many, many hearings and discussions at the House Intelligence Committee as a member of that committee and feel very privileged to have done so. 
   I can't help but think of those whose shoulders we stand on, our predecessors in the House of Representatives in the Congress of over 200 years. Would any of them, would any of them for a moment accuse another Member of not wanting to fully protect the Nation that we are sworn to protect and the Constitution that we are sworn to uphold? That's what this debate is about. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was born in 1978. And the reason our predecessors, Republicans and Democrats, set down this law was because of the abuses of those high in our government at that time, Richard Nixon. And Republicans and Democrats in the Congress as well as Republican and Democratic Presidents have honored the law, but they have also seen fit to change it, from 1978 on, to fit the needs of this great Nation. 
   And so to talk about blood on someone's hands, that there are some that do not love and want to protect this country does not deserve to be debated or even stated in this House. We all take the same oath. We all take the same oath. And when we take that oath, we say ``to defend the Constitution of the United States.'' That is the steel of our Nation. The flag that is behind us is the heart of our Nation, but the Constitution is the soul of our Nation. 
   And so, in all of this we say ``rule of law.'' This is not to cheapen FISA. This is not, as the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, making fun of attorneys and saying we're sending it off to people that are going to quibble. We are talking about the rule of law. 
   The Democratic leadership last night gave the principles to the DNI, Director of National Intelligence, last night. Something happened after that, and it's not satisfactory. But we will not turn over to an Attorney General who has misled the Congress, who has now made a hospital visit famous, who came to the Hill and lobbied for torture, we are not going to give over what we believe should dictate all of this, and that is the rule of law.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I think what is important to understand in this debate is that there are significant technical obstacles that have to be addressed before biofuels can be widely deployed. 
   Many Members this morning during this important debate have spoken about the importance of biofuels. This amendment to the amendment actually kind of drills down, as it were, into the specifics and I think strengthens a very good bill. 
   The bill before us recognizes the specific infrastructure challenges that we are already facing in implementing the Renewable Fuels Standards program which was enacted in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. It anticipates the challenge of the more widespread use of biofuels, which I think most of us are for, by authorizing the EPA to initiate a research and development project to make biofuels more compatible with the existing petroleum storage and distribution system. If there is not distribution in this system, it simply is not going to work. 
   Now, the reason I am offering this perfecting amendment to Mr. Burgess' amendment, along with my colleague Mr. Cardoza, simply requires the EPA, as part of this R&D program, to consider strategies to minimize emissions. I want to repeat this, because these are the two operative words, to minimize emissions that may be released when biofuels are blended, stored, and transported. 
   We all understand that pollutants contained in gasoline and other motor fuels are released into the atmosphere as a result of combustion, and I think Mr. Burgess speaks to this, but his amendment is more about combustion. This is about emissions also occurring as the result of evaporation while fuel is held in storage tanks or transferred on and off tanker trucks. 
   In the case of gasoline containing ethanol, evaporative emissions of certain substances, specifically VOCs, can be greater than they would be from conventional gasoline. In certain regions trying to comply with the Clean Air Act, and I think Mr. Burgess, certainly Mr. Cardoza and others are driven by understanding that where they have ground-level ozone, these emissions could be problematic, in fact, increased.

   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will be brief. 
   I appreciate what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying. I think it needs to be very, very clear to all the Members of the House who are going to cast a vote on this to understand what the underlying bill seeks to do. 
   It is an infrastructure bill. It is not a combustion bill. It is an infrastructure bill, and that is why I have offered the amendment to the amendment. It deals with infrastructure. It directs the EPA to minimize. We all want VOCs minimized. It is the way biofuels are going to become effective in our country, and how they are stored and how they are handled is going to give rise to what we are all seeking. 
   This is a bipartisan effort, and I do not think anyone should get confused about what we are voting on. I wish that as we did our outreach to Mr. Burgess that they would have been part of the same effort. 
   So we are all for biofuels. We want to make them effective and, again, remember that this is an infrastructure bill. It is not a combustion-type bill. So I thank the gentleman for giving me time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I want to salute the chairman of our committee for his superb leadership and caring so much about not only the issues of intelligence but everyone that is a part of the intelligence community. I want to thank all of the marvelous staff on the majority and minority side, and I salute the ranking member of the committee as well. 
   This is a tough committee to serve on. People don't know what we are talking about. We do it in secret. We really can't talk to our colleagues very much about it. And yet we make some of the weightiest decisions that any Members of Congress would make because we deal with what is the most important issue, and that is our national security, the protection of the American people and giving the intelligence community, making the choices to give the intelligence community all the tools it needs in order to function and protect the American people and that we weigh and balance and always know that we are working under the Constitution of the United States of America. So this is really where the rubber meets the road. 
   I support the bill. Just like all of the other bills we deal with, there are pluses and minuses. I am very pleased that there are no earmarks in this bill. That is the first time since I came onto the committee that that is the case. I am very glad that 75 percent of the dollars for covert action have been fenced. In other words, no notification from the administration and from the intelligence community, no money. And that's the way it should be because the American people expect us to verify. They expect us to know and then we can take action. We have to do oversight. 
   For the first time in the history of our country, we have brought together a National Intelligence Assessment on global climate change and the effect it will have on national security. I am very proud of the work we have been able to do on that. 
   For the first time there will be an inspector general in the intelligence community; and the administration, believe it or not, is still fighting that. Imagine having an inspector general, independent oversight of the intelligence community. I think that's a darn good idea and I hope it will prevail and that the President changes his mind on this. 
   We still have a lot of work to do to have more human intelligence in countries where we need them. We have a lot of work to do on black prison sites, the operation of them by the CIA and renditions. But with that, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend especially Congressman Bud Cramer for the magnificent, honest work he has done on the Intelligence Committee and here in the Congress and wish him well, and Mr. Everett, too. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the bill. It has good things and it has some other things that are missing. But overall, I think it is a bill worth supporting.

   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for yielding. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 2082. 
   First, I want to make a comment about a requirement that is in the bill that has been made fun of, made fun of by our friends on the other side of the aisle, and that is that the bill requires a National Intelligence Estimate on the national security implications of global climate change. I take issue with their diminishment of this issue.

   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairman, as I said when I was speaking a little bit ago, and I am going to make some comments about this amendment, I want to set something else down which I think is really important, and that is, that it's not debatable that this is the largest single intelligence authorization in the history of our country. 
   Now, we are hearing a lot from the other side, hearing a lot from the other side, not enough money, not enough money, not enough money. When did you make any amendments to increase anything in this authorization, with the exception of an earmark with three States specified? That's what you offered, and that's the only thing that you offered. 
   So I think it's important for the people of our country to know what's going on. 
   Now, on this amendment that Mr. Hoekstra offers, this is not a study of climate change. This is a directive to the intelligence community to assess the impacts of climate change; and most frankly, I would go with the former Army chief of staff, Retired General Gordon Sullivan, who said the national security consequences of global climate change should be fully integrated into the national security and national defense strategies, including a National Intelligence Estimate. Climate change is a national security issue. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey).

   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Chairwoman, let me just close out this very important debate, and it is important to have a debate. It's very important to have a debate. 
   In listening to it, I see two things: one, a rearview mirror, looking to the past, people that are sincere, but nonetheless I think are sticking their heads in the sand. When we see whole populations, massive movement of populations, moving across borders because of drought, moving across borders because of disruption, they cause national security issues. We know that. 
   This debate is about the future, and I understand why some have trouble seeing the future and even embracing it, much less harnessing it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, and to all of the Members of the House, I rise this evening with a sad heart. The first thing I want to say is to offer my special condolences to Annette Lantos, the love of Tom's life, actually as has been said earlier this morning, childhood sweethearts, to his two exceptional daughters, to his son-in-laws, 18 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. 
   I have known Tom Lantos for many decades, long before I came to the House of Representatives. And I remember that November of 1980 where I think he was the only Democrat that won in challenging a Republican. It was a real upset in the 12th Congressional District. And so tonight I am thinking about the people of the 12th Congressional District because they not only handed him a victory, he never forgot it, and he used his public service to fulfill the great responsibility and the charge that they gave to him. 
   Our congressional districts are next door to one another. Tom always said that he stood between the Speaker and myself because his congressional district was between ours. 
   Tom Lantos was truly a gentleman. He was a gentleman with old world manners. He was a scholar. He taught economics. When he spoke, everyone knew he was scholarly, and so the old term ``a scholar and a gentleman'' really belonged to Tom. 
   He was an immigrant, and I think, during these times when immigrants are not fully appreciated, that Tom Lantos should remind us of what comes to this country in terms of immigrants. He came here, as he said, penniless, but he came here and brought his hopes and aspirations. Who would have thought when Tom Lantos came through Customs and the Immigration Service that he would one day come to the House of Representatives and, in the day after he died, that all of these accolades that he so is deserving of would be said about him. 
   A poet wrote, ``And so he passed on, and then all the trumpets sounded on the other side.'' God rest your soul, Tom. Thank you for what you have given to America and thank you for what you did in the House of Representatives. Thank you for what you did for the people of the 12th Congressional District. We are forever grateful.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bridge loan for the American automotive industry. 
   Last month the heads of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler came to Congress seeking a $25 billion emergency bridge loan. They each flew to Washington on corporate jets without a credible restructuring plan for long-term viability and profitability. The message they got from Congress was, ``no plan, no money.'' 
   Last week the CEOs returned to Washington with detailed plans to create new, lean, profitable, and competitive companies. Their plans include manufacturing more fuel-efficient cars and crossovers, concessions from the United Auto Workers, more streamlined companies with less brands and retail outlets, reductions in manufacturing and structural costs, as well as many other necessary elements to make the companies viable again. 
   Through bipartisan negotiations with the White House, the Congressional leadership has produced legislation that offers the ailing automakers a $15 billion bridge loan if they agree to strict oversight of their finances and business practices. 
   Many people have suggested that bankruptcy is a better option for the automakers. A recent study by an automotive research firm found that 80 percent of car buyers would switch brands if the vehicle they want comes from an automaker that has filed for bankruptcy. If the companies are forced into bankruptcy it would ultimately lead to liquidation which would lead to even more turmoil in our economy. Manufacturing facilities would close immediately. Hourly and salaried employees would lose their jobs and the small businesses that provide parts and services to the automotive industry would lose billions of dollars if the ``Detroit 3'' went into liquidation. These devastating losses would be felt nationwide and our economy can't afford it. 
   The ``Detroit 3'' automakers have made numerous bad decisions in the past and no one has been more critical of them than I have, but allowing them to fail would cause a chain of events felt well beyond Detroit. Job losses would occur in every sector, from the engineers needed to design the cars, to the car dealership employees that make their living selling them. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. could lose up to 3.3 million jobs if one or more of the automakers fail. The same study found that California alone could lose up to 305,900 jobs. A shutdown of the auto industry would have a catastrophic effect on an economy that is already in historic distress. That's why prudent steps must be taken to prevent this from happening. 
   H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act will give the participating automakers a $15 billion, 7-year bridge loan at a 5 percent interest rate for the first 5 years and a 9 percent interest rate thereafter. The funding for these loans will come from $25 billion that Congress already approved in Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   The bill incorporates strong protections and numerous oversight provisions to protect the American taxpayer. It includes the creation of a ``Car Czar,'' a person to be appointed by the President in order to oversee the loan program. This oversight official would also have the power to negotiate with creditors, unions and other stakeholders in the restructuring process. 
   The car companies are barred from paying bonuses to their executives and barred from paying dividends to shareholders while the loans are outstanding. The bill also gives the government an equity stake in the companies so that taxpayers will benefit when the companies return to profit. It also mandates that the automakers submit to an audit by the Government Accountability Office and the Inspector General for the Treasury's financial bailout program. 
   I voted ``yes'' today because I believe that the stakes are too high for the economy to not do anything. Without the bridge loan to the American automakers we will put the jobs of millions of Americans at risk and impose further strife on our economy. Their failure would reverberate far beyond the manufacturing sector and a bridge loan to keep these companies viable while they restructure is necessary to protect the economy in this financial crisis.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker; first I want to commend the Chairman and the Majority leader for the work they've done to bring this legislation to the floor of the House. It has been a challenge for all of us on the Intelligence Committee and in the Congress. 
   This legislation is a vast improvement over the previous law, and indeed over the Protect America Act passed by the House last August which I opposed. 
   The bill very importantly establishes a process for electronic surveillance that includes prior approval by the independent courts, and in some respects, this legislation goes even further than the existing FISA statute or the House-passed RESTORE Act in protecting the civil liberties of U.S. persons. Under this bill the Administration would have to seek a court order before conducting surveillance on U.S. persons abroad. Until now and under the Protect America Act, the executive branch could conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. persons without prior judicial approval. This legislation also allows the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies to go forward in a limited fashion, which would not have occurred at all under current law. 
   Having said this I must oppose this bill. 
   Under the original structure of FISA, telecommunications carriers served an important gate-keeping function. They were not permitted to provide access to private communications in the United States unless the government made a lawful request to conduct surveillance, pursuant to a FISA order. For decades, the government has sought and obtained thousands of FISA warrants prior to beginning surveillance, or in urgent cases shortly thereafter. We all remember the shocking news when the President had to acknowledge that his Administration created an illegal, warrantless electronic surveillance program outside of the FISA legal framework. 
   This legislation would essentially grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers who relied on statements made by this Administration that the program was lawful. However, as we've seen in numerous instances, this Administration pushed new and aggressive interpretations of the law, including in this area. We all recall vividly the days following \9/11\, and the urgency that prevailed, but suspending our laws and allowing the Attorney General to unilaterally issue a ``get out of jail free card'' is not appropriate under any circumstances. There should be at least some minimal inquiry into whether the telecommunications carriers reliance on the statements made by this Administration was reasonable. If so, the they would be able to assert their existing statutory immunity defenses. 
   Throughout our Nation's history, the judiciary has been the most important check on an overzealous executive, and it is often through the judicial process that we uncover and remedy some of the most egregious executive misconduct. This legislation undermines and effectively nullifies the courts' ability to hold the Administration accountable for its actions, which likely violated the Constitution. 
   Our Nation was founded on the principle of separation of powers. The executive branch should be subject to independent oversight by the judicial branch. This legislation does not go far enough to allow the judicial branch to conduct an independent, reasoned inquiry into this critical issue. Therefore, I must oppose this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this children's health insurance bill, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor of it. 
   This bill is the result of a great deal of work to meet concerns of colleagues in the minority. We want them to join us in voting for it in order to override a presidential veto and finally enroll 10 million children in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The bill makes it legislatively clear that no adults will be covered--only children are. 
   The bill makes it legislatively clear that non-citizens will not be covered. 
   The bill makes it legislatively clear that only low-income children will be covered. 
   The bill makes it legislatively clear that no one earning $83,000 a year will receive coverage under this bill. 
   While we've addressed every significant objection to this bill, we have not compromised on the number of children covered. Our goal has been to cover ten million low-income, uninsured children and we do. 
   Virtually everyone with a stake in public health and healthcare is calling for this bill to be passed. There are 270 groups supporting this bill: 43 Republican and Democratic governors; the American Medical Association; AARP; America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP); the Healthcare Leadership Council; and Catholic Charities, among others. 
   This is an extraordinary investment in our children and our collective future. I urge every Member of the House to vote for it, and when we do it, it will be a major victory for the little ones in our country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this effort to override the President's veto of H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization bill. 
   Virtually everyone with a stake in public health and health care is calling for this bill to be passed. There are 270 groups supporting this bill: 43 Republican and Democratic governors, including Governor Schwarzenegger, the American Medical Association, AARP, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the Healthcare Leadership Council, and Catholic Charities, among others. 
   There are at least 10 million reasons to insure the children of our Nation because 10 million children don't have healthcare coverage today. 
   The bill provides dental care, mental health benefits, and other medically necessary benefits that are part of the program. 
   The bill provides coverage to expectant mothers. 
   The bill allows States to provide assistance for CHIP-eligible kids to secure private insurance through a parent's employer-sponsored coverage. 
   The bill is fully funded by a 61-cent per pack increase in the tax on cigarettes. 
   The opponents of this bill are hiding behind the thinnest arguments. 
   They say there are only 500,000 uninsured kids who are eligible for CHIP that we need to enroll. This is incorrect. According to the Urban Institute, there are more than 6.6 million low-income children who qualify for CHIP but are yet to be enrolled. This bill provides States with the resources and incentives to ensure these kids get the coverage they're eligible for. 
   The President says the program will cover children in families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year. Senator GRASSLEY, the Ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, disputes this charge, saying ``the president has been served wrong information about what our bill will do.'' In fact, the bill provides incentives for States to enroll children below 200% of poverty and any State that chooses to provide more generous coverage must get approval from the Administration. 
   Opponents assert that the bill increases taxes on ``working people.'' The truth is it increases taxes on smokers. Not only does this help pay for the program, but according to the Institute of Medicine, by increasing the tobacco tax, there will be a decrease in tobacco use, particularly among young people. 
   Opponents assert the bill will cover adults not children. Although the program has been used to cover adults in the past, this practice will be phased out over the next two years. 
   Opponents assert that the bill gives coverage to undocumented aliens. There is nothing in the bill that would provide such coverage. In fact, the bill says, ``nothing in this act allows federal payment for individuals who are not legal residents.'' 
   The moment has arrived for the House of Representatives to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and when we do, we will stand next to the children and on the side of a brighter future for them and our entire country.

<DOCNO>Ms. ESHOO. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. I thank our distinguished chairman and am proud as an  original cosponsor to support the bill that is before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the Medicare part D legislation was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives in 2003, I voted against it. I think it is worth recalling that evening. I think it is worth recalling that evening. The 15-minute vote on the clock was left open for almost 3 hours, where arms were broken and twisted in order to secure passage of the bill. 
   One of the most troubling aspects of the legislation to the American people, and we have all heard it from our constituents, was that the legislation said that the Secretary of Health and Human Services was prohibited, prohibited, from securing the best price to purchase pharmaceutical drugs. That is a bad rub with the American people. 
   They saw through it, and we are here today to correct that provision. Drug prices under the current Medicare prescription drug plan are more than 80 percent higher than prices negotiated by other agencies in the Federal Government. 
   They are more than 60 percent higher than prices in Canada. This year alone, many beneficiaries and private drug plans will see their premiums increase by an average of 10 percent, while some premiums will rise to more than six times their current costs to beneficiaries. So this effort today is a very full and clear and purposefully directed one, and that is to get better prices for prescription drugs. 
   Whether you are covered by insurance or not, some here are in Medicare, some not, as Members of Congress, but you know, that when you go to buy, when you go to purchase, that we are paying high prices. We all support the innovation of the pharmaceutical industry. 
   We know how important the innovation of the pharmaceutical industry is. This is not a vote or a bill to harm that or to damage it, but we want to be fair to the American people. We made a pledge that we would do this. This correction is more than in order. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. I want to congratulate Mrs. Emerson for the courage that she has demonstrated on this issue over the years.  
   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 which will repeal a provision of the 2003 Medicare law which prohibits the Secretary of HHS from negotiating lower drug prices for Medicare's 43 million beneficiaries. The bill not only permits the Secretary to negotiate, it requires him to. 
   Mr. Speaker, I opposed the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan passed by the House in 2003, and in the nearly three years since its passage it has been demonstrated conclusively that it does not contain drug price inflation, nor does it offer our nation's seniors the best prices for their prescription drugs. A recent Families USA study shows that under the current policy, prices charged by Medicare drug plans are in fact rising at more than twice the rate of inflation. 
   Drug prices under the current Medicare prescription drug plan are more than 80 percent higher than prices negotiated by other agencies in the federal government and they are more than 60 percent higher than prices in Canada. This year alone, many beneficiaries in private drug plans will see their premiums increase by an average of 10 percent, while some premiums will rise to more than six-times their current cost to beneficiaries. 
   This week the University of Michigan Medical School released a study which found that people who live in different states but take the same drugs, pay dramatically different prices for their prescription drugs, at times differing by thousands of dollars. The authors of the study found the extreme disparities were due to the fact that individual drug plans negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to devise their own drug lists, premiums and co-pays. 
   Under the legislation before us, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will not only be required to conduct important cost-saving negotiations, but individual drug plans will still be permitted to obtain further discounts or prices lower than the price negotiated by HHS for covered prescription drugs. This will encourage increased competition in the marketplace, which will help guarantee America's seniors the lowest price possible on their prescription drugs. 
   In an additional effort to encourage lower drug prices, the bill also expressly prohibits the Secretary from limiting seniors' access to certain medications, or from favoring one drug over another through restrictive formularies. 
   The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform estimates H.R. 4 will reduce overall drug costs by 25 percent. Over a 10-year period, the total savings for Medicare beneficiaries would reach an estimated $61 billion. These savings would be reflected in lower premiums, I reduced co-pays, and lower out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries in the ``doughnut hole.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, America's seniors deserve better than the current Medicare drug plan, and the American people know it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report. 
   This week marks 3 years since the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission, issued a comprehensive set of bipartisan recommendations to Congress to address the shortcomings in our Nation's intelligence infrastructure that led to the tragic attacks of 9/11. 
   While Congress acted on some of the recommendations, many of the Commission's most important recommendations sat on a shelf for two-and-a-half years, until the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress. 
   We acted quickly to pass legislation to: 
   Ensure homeland security grants are targeted for states and high-risk urban areas based on risk of terrorism;  
   Improve interoperability of first-responder communications at local, State, and Federal levels; 
   Provide over $4 billion over 4 years for rail, transit, and bus security grants; 
   Mandate screening of all maritime cargo within five years and all airline cargo within 3 years; and 
   Provide sunshine on the activities of the Intelligence Community by requiring the President to publicly disclose the total budget for the intelligence community. 
   Now that the Senate has also acted and we have the Conference Report before us, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and send it to the President's desk for his signature. 
   These are not partisan issues. Assessing blame for past failures will not help us protect our future. However, refusing to recognize these failures and not take the critical steps to ensure that they don't ever occur again is not acceptable. 
   The American people owe a great deal to the work of the 9/11 Commission and the inspired leadership of the families of 9/11 victims, without whom the original legislation would not have become law. 
   These reforms are long overdue and we should not waste another day in enacting them into law.

<TEXT>
   Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me, the distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, it has been a long and painful 4-year journey for the people of our country since this administration acted preemptively and unilaterally to invade and occupy Iraq, policies which I believe then and I still believe today would not and could not stand because they simply are not in our national character. 
   We were told Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. None were found. 
   We were told there was yellow cake. It was a falsehood. 
   We were told that there were trailers containing the evidence of deadly chemicals. 
   We were told the mission was accomplished. 
   We endured national and international shame when the horrific pictures depicting Abu Ghraib appeared. 
   We learned that our troops were not sufficiently equipped. 
   We mourned with our constituents as the death toll of American troops mounted and continued to mount. Just think, 137 casualties in November of 2004, then the deadliest month overall. Today, over 3,000 precious U.S. lives have been lost, with thousands maimed and injured and God knows how many innocent Iraqi lives lost. 
   We witnessed the world community's total support on 9/11, and we have witnessed the diminishment of America's credibility around the world because of the Iraq war. 
   We have heard the President and the Vice President talk about victory and insurgency in its last throes. 
   We have learned of manipulated intelligence and endured a no-oversight Congress. 
   Preemptive war, unilateralism, invasion, occupation, no post-war plan, an insurgency born of our blunders, and arrogance instead of reality. 
   Meanwhile, military experts, Generals Abizaid, Odom, Powell, and distinguished civilian leaders have called for change, a new strategy, and the urgency of diplomatic and political engagement, all to no avail. 
   One of the central findings of the recent NIE, the National Intelligence Estimate, highlighted the lack of effective Iraqi leadership as a main component driving sectarian and communal violence. 
   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group, appointed by the President, reported the utter urgency of action by the administration.
