<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the economic stimulus package. I want to congratulate our Leadership for working in a bipartisan manner to bring much-needed economic relief to all sectors of our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, our economy is on a downturn. We are seeing gas prices, grocery prices, heating bills, and the price of consumer goods steadily increase. 
   The dollar has fallen to new alltime lows, prompting inflation fears and the standing of our currency in the world market. 
   Our housing foreclosure rates continue to threaten the quality of life for our constituents. In my hometown of Sacramento, the foreclosure rate is now the fourth highest in the Nation, with 1 out of every 48 homeowners burdened by this crisis last year. 
    Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, I believe it is the right time for economic intervention by this Congress. 
   This economic stimulus package put forth today is targeted, temporary, and timely. 
   It will put hundreds of dollars into consumer pockets and bring financial relief to millions of working families. It will significantly expand the child tax credit. 
    Madam Speaker, this package also seeks to help those in danger of losing their homes. Americans across our Nation are being challenged daily by the mortgage crisis. 
   By raising the FHA and GSE loan limits, this bill will inject much-needed liquidity into the California housing market, and more importantly into the Sacramento region. 
   It will allow struggling homeowners to get out of bad loans and refinance into more affordable loans. 
   This bill is an important first step. I am proud that we were able to work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to start the process of relieving the economic strain being felt by families across this great country. 
    Madam Speaker, I again want to thank our Leadership for their hard work on this bill. It is critical that we get our economy back on track. This stimulus package is a step in the right direction.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   The housing crisis has had an unprecedented effect on our economy. Our families, our neighborhoods, our communities are facing daily challenges, seeing increased foreclosures and vacancies everywhere they turn. 
   My own hometown of Sacramento is among the hardest hit in this country. Just last quarter, nearly 5,300 homes were foreclosed on. And sadly, there is no end in sight. My district is fifth in the Nation in adjustable rate mortgages, many of which are reset to higher rates in the near future. 
   To make matters worse, Forbes magazine ranks Sacramento among the highest in homeowner debt. Twenty-eight percent of homeowners in my district hold second mortgages and/or home equity lines of credit, making it much more difficult for them to save their homes. 
   This crisis is affecting everyone; homeowners who are in danger of foreclosure, renters who are being forced to move, and even families who are secure in their mortgages are seeing their home values fall, and increased neighborhood blight. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year I have met with many Sacramento families that are struggling with their mortgages in today's volatile economy. I have seen the sadness in their eyes and the emotional toll this crisis has taken on them. It is truly devastating. I met Susan at a foreclosure workshop. She had a traditional mortgage that was in good standing. Then, after repeated calls, she was steered by a lender to refinance her traditional loan into an adjustable rate loan so she could do home improvements. Now the loan is scheduled to reset soon, and she will have a difficult time making ends meet. 
   Another constituent, Jeanie, e-mailed me just last week. She has been forced to move twice already this year because the homes she was renting were foreclosed on. Without some stability in the housing market, Jeanie and her family, including their young daughter, will be forced to move again. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to help these honest, hardworking homeowners immediately. This legislation is a step in the right direction. I urge support of this rule and this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this historic and long-overdue legislation. Today's bill offers geopolitical and economic security, environmental sustainability, and significant cost savings for American consumers. 
   It is a strategy to fight global warming. It is a compromise that raises fuel efficiency standards. It is an investment in a new generation of manufacturing jobs. 
   This bill creates a world where American resources and ingenuity are used to make American energy, not to import it from other countries. 
   The bill raises CAFE standards for the first time since 1975. As a result, each American family could save up to $1,000 a year at the pump. That alone should be reason enough for every Member of Congress to support this compromise. 
   But today's bill does even more. It frees us from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil. By 2030, it will save Americans more than double the level of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf That amounts to more than 4 million barrels saved every single day. 
   This energy package also invests in the American people by creating three million green jobs over 10 years. 
   With this bill, Mr. Speaker, we are forging an entirely new kind of economy--a clean energy economy. My hometown of Sacramento is the perfect example of a community that will contribute to this new energy economy. 
   We have a growing clean-energy industry that is poised to take off. Our local utility already produces power from solar, wind, and methane gas. More and more of our region's homes, businesses, and vehicles are powered by renewable energy. 
   However, my constituents need help from the Federal Government to bring this new energy economy into the mainstream. 
   That is why I am proud to stand before the House today in support of this revolutionary energy package. It makes landmark investments in the energy economy that is developing in Sacramento and in likeminded cities across our great Nation. 
   The biofuels this bill develops will power my constituents' cars. New fuel efficiency standards will help them save money on gas. They will work some of the millions of green-collar jobs it creates. This energy bill helps Sacramento continue to lead our country's energy revolution. 
   One of the cornerstones of this revolution is a renewable portfolio standard. My home State of California already has such a standard. So do more than 20 other States. I have seen this progressive policy in action, Mr. Speaker, and it has contributed greatly to my home State's groundbreaking efforts to increase the use of clean power and forestall global warming. 
   I am pleased that a renewable portfolio standard has been included in this comprehensive energy package. What works for our states can--and will--work for the entire country. 
   Mr. Speaker, in Congress we often talk about creating a better future for our children and grandchildren. Today's energy bill will create this better future. It is a future of energy independence, clean power, fuel-efficient vehicles, and economic growth. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chairman, I am truly proud to see the Employee Free Choice Act on the floor of the House. This represents a tremendous step forward for working families in this country. I want to thank Chairman MILLER for crafting this excellent legislation and for his tireless efforts on behalf of workers. 
   A little less than a year ago, Chairman MILLER and I held a forum on this legislation in my hometown of Sacramento. We heard emotional testimony from workers about their experiences in the workplace. They had been subjected to coercion and intimidation--and some had even been fired--simply because of their desire to join a union. 
   After sharing encounter after encounter, they asked Congress to pass the Employee Free Choice Act. They know that this legislation would protect them from these abuses. It would repair the cracks in the current system. And it would allow them to make a real choice in deciding to join a union. 
   It is one thing to talk in the abstract about the policy. It is quite another to see first hand the human face, the real life consequences of that policy. What we are talking about is helping working Americans--the middle class--meet the needs of their families. 
   Congress must take advantage of this chance to act. A strong middle class has been the bedrock of expanded prosperity and opportunity in this country. 
   And our middle class families are at a critical juncture. They face some daunting challenges. Wages are not keeping up with inflation. Yet, the costs the typical middle class family faces--such as housing, health care, transportation and college--continue to rise dramatically. We risk losing the strong middle class that has been the backbone of this Nation. 
   Throughout our history, protecting the right to organize has played a critical role in improving the wages and quality of life for working people, and in growing the middle class. 
   To preserve the middle class, it is critical that we continue to keep the central promise of our Nation's labor laws--that workers be empowered to make their own decisions about a collective bargaining representative. 
   NLRB elections, as they exist today, often do not allow such a choice. And that's where the Employee Free Choice Act comes in. As Chairman MILLER has explained so well, it will take important steps to level the playing field for workers who are trying to organize. It will allow employees to make a real choice to join a union without intimidation. And it will provide for stronger penalties when companies engage in illegal practices. Because the right to organize and form a union is fundamental to ensuring a fair balance of power in the workplace. 
   And you know, this is not an anti-business bill, as its being portrayed by its opponents. This is a pro-workplace bill. What I mean is that when you have a card check system, it makes for a successful workplace--for the company and for workers. 
   At the forum I held with Chairman MILLER in Sacramento, we heard from a second panel of workers whose employer had voluntarily agreed to a card check system. This employer, and the many others that have agreed to a card check system, understand there is a benefit to treating employees with dignity and respect. They understand that when a company lets workers weigh the pros and cons of joining a union--without harassment or intimidation--those workers will be more productive and more committed to the success of the company. 
   Frankly, if you care about working families, these reforms are simply common sense. They will make the organizing process simpler, more fair, and most importantly, ensure that the fundamental right of choosing whether or not to join a union rests squarely where it belongs: with this Nation's workers. 
   I promised my constituents that I would do everything I could do get this bill passed in the House. So I am proud that it is on the floor today. Members have an opportunity--by voting in favor of this legislation--to stand with the working families of this country. I urge my colleagues to take advantage of that opportunity.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, here in the first hours of the 110th Congress we rise to restore decorum and civility to what has been from its founding the greatest deliberative institution. In doing so, we open a new chapter in the history of the House of Representatives, one that is dignified. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people spoke loud and clear this past November, and I am proud to say that the Democratic majority is responding to that call. This legislation marks a new beginning. The Democratic reform package, H. Res. 6, enacts long overdue congressional reform: restoring an open government, an honest government, an ethical government; and it marks the restoration of the American people's priorities to the people's House. It is my hope that by enacting these changes we will be able to change the tone of how we conduct business in this Chamber and with each other. 
   I recall a time in the House of Representatives and not too long ago when Members had friends on both sides of the aisle. Our children played together, they got to know each other, they became friends. Our families ate dinner together. We treated each other as friends and colleagues, and debate on the House floor reflected mutual respect even when we disagreed and an understanding that we all have a role to play in the legislative process. 
   We are here today to say that this sense of civility and decorum is not dead. This institution is too great to permit any tarnish of its honor to become permanent or to allow the slights of yesterday to interfere with our efforts to build a better tomorrow. Civility can return to this great institution with the right style of leadership. 
   As we turn here and now in the first hours of the 110th Congress, part of that process is making sure that House rules can prevent the abuses of prior Congresses. This is the overarching intent of H. Res. 6. In particular, there are several provisions in title III of that resolution that will begin to restore civility and decorum to the legislative process and which will honor this Chamber's place as the people's House by making us more accountable to the people who sent us here. 
   The first provision of title III prohibits floor votes from being held open for more than 15 minutes for the sole purpose of changing the outcome of a vote. Voting is a Member's core responsibility and our primary means of giving voice to the view of our constituents. This reform is important and long overdue. 
   The other two provisions address the handling of conference reports, with the goal to end backroom deals for special interests. In the 110th Congress, conference committees will be conducted in an open and fair manner, and conference reports containing last-minute provisions will not be considered on the House floor.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a few comments so that all Members may keep in mind the heart of what we are doing today. 
   These two days of debate on the House floor mark a historic moment for reform of the people's House. The American people grew tired of a Republican Congress too unethical to conduct its business in the light of day and too deaf to hear the people's complaint. And so this past November the people exercised their right to vote in order to send a message. It was a mandate for change, to restore civility, decorum, and ethical behavior to Congress. Democrats are acting swiftly in response to their call. 
   When it passes the House later today, the Democratic ethics package will be the greatest reform of this institution in history. There will be no more corporate jet travel paid by special interests, no more roll call votes held open for hours in the middle of the night so that Members could be arm twisted on the floor, no more anonymous earmarks, no more last-minute provisions slipped in conference reports. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic reform package is far tougher than anything Republicans ever proposed or enacted, and it will restore integrity to this sacred institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman, our new Member from Vermont (Mr. Welch).

This past November, the people exercised a right to vote in order to send the message. It was a mandate for change to restore civility, decorum and ethical behavior to Congress. 
   As I said in my opening remarks, debate on House floor must reflect mutual respect, even when we disagree. I look forward to restoring decorum and civility to this House, restoring integrity to what is truly the people's House. I urge all Members to join us in that effort.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation, even though it does not do as much as I would like. In fact, less than 2 months ago I voted with a majority of this body for a bill that covered more children. It strengthened health care for millions of American citizens and restored fairness to our Medicare system and invested in preventive health. 
   Unfortunately, that bill cannot pass the Senate. And sometimes, in order to make change, we must compromise. Compromise is why we are here today,  Mr. Speaker. And though the bill before is us is not ideal, it is a step in the right direction. 
   It is rare that Members of Congress have the chance to provide health care to 4 million more children with one vote, but that is the opportunity we have today. 
   My district is like many others in this country. In my hometown of Sacramento, there are children who can see a doctor when they get sick. They go to a pediatrician and get a checkup or have their ear infection examined or their teeth cleaned regularly. 
   But there are also thousands of children in Sacramento who do not have this access, thousands of kids whose families cannot afford the huge cost of health insurance. These are children who cannot see a doctor until they're seriously ill, children who do not get the medical attention until they get to an emergency room. It is for these children, the thousands in Sacramento and the millions across the country, that we must pass this legislation today. 
   It is for these children that the President must sign this bill. If he vetoes it, he turns his back on 4 million more children in need. He will disregard the will of a clear majority of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before this House today as a colleague, but also as a proud grandmother. My two grandchildren are named Anna and Robby. Most of what I do in Congress is colored by how it will affect them and their generation. 
   Anna and Robby are fortunate. They have stable reliable health insurance. Millions of other children are not so lucky. Anna and Robby's peers are the reason I support this compromise bill, Mr. Speaker, even though it ignores many of the problems that the CHAMP Act addressed. Anna and Robby's peers are still the reason we should all support this bill, and they are the reason the President must sign it. 
   We'll return to this issue soon, Mr. Speaker. We'll finish what we began with the CHAMP Act. But for now, for the sake of millions of children in this country, I urge all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 464 provides for consideration of S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. The closed rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill and against its consideration except those arising under clause 10 of rule XXI. The rule also provides one motion to commit. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's debate on stem cell research should be about the hope of science. It should be about how our society has always valued ethical medical research. 
   Many Americans awoke this morning to a news story about a potential new stem cell research technique using skin cells from mice. It was on the front page of many newspapers precisely because our society values hope and scientific advancement when done in an ethical manner. 
   The bill made in order under this rule maintains that tradition. With the House's approval, expanded Federal embryonic stem cell research again will be one signature away from becoming law. 
   Mr. Speaker, we already know that embryonic stem cell research has a potential to cure many debilitating conditions like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, spinal cord damage, and maybe even bone marrow failure. These ailments affect the young and the old, the rich and the poor. 
   Families from all walks of life have had firsthand experiences with these tragedies. Sad but true, disease is one of life's great equalizers. Research and medical ingenuity are our society's tools to fight these diseases. 
   This shared experience, the hope that stem cell research brings, may be one reason why it enjoys such bipartisan support. Polls indicate that three out of every five Americans support stem cell research, including 54 percent of Republicans. 
   But there are many other reasons to endorse expanded Federal stem cell research. Earlier this year, Congress and the world heard support from an unexpected source. In testimony before Congress on March 19, the Director of the NIH made a high-profile break with the administration on shortsighted stem cell policy. He said: ``It is clear today that American science would be better served and the Nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines that they can study.'' 
   The United States has always led the effort to push the frontiers of medical research. But as the NIH Director's testimony indicates, Mr. Speaker, on this issue the United States is falling behind for no good scientific or moral reason. 
   His testimony is in line with the consensus within the wider scientific community as well. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation, the UC Davis Medical Center in my hometown of Sacramento, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in my colleague's district, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, all of these and hundreds of others support ethical embryonic stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is abundantly clear that we must update our national stem cell research policy. A bipartisan majority in Congress has tried several times. Last year, both Chambers voted by wide bipartisan margins to expand ethical Federal stem cell research. Unfortunately, the President blocked that progress, that hope, that good science. But his veto only delays the issue temporarily because support for this responsible research continues to grow. 
   Earlier this year, the new Democratic majority acted swiftly to reconsider the issue. The bill before us is a result of that bipartisan, bicameral leadership; and it passed by a greater margin than in the last Congress.  
   We should act now to forward that proposal on to the President. We should give him another chance to do what is right by signing this bill into law. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is little disagreement about the science of stem cell research or what ethical rules should govern it, so let's stop delaying a commonsense proposal. I urge all Members to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I include the following statements in support of S. 5: 
   Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation  
   June 7, 2007.  
   The Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation (CRPF) strongly supports efforts to expand the current, restrictive policy governing embryonic stem cell research, under strict, ethical guidelines. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, S. 5, will accomplish the expansion, while maintaining strong ethical standards. Enactment of S. 5 will provide hope to the estimated 1.5 million men, women and children diagnosed with cancer each year. 
   The House and Senate have both passed legislation in the 110th Congress that will expand the current policy by allowing Federally-funded research to be conducted on embryos derived after August 9, 2001, on leftover embryos that will be otherwise destroyed or discarded by fertility clinics. The legislation ensures that no Federal funds will be used to create or derive embryos for research purposes, nor will any individual be compensated for donation of an embryo for research purposes. 
   According to a poll recently released by the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, nearly sixty (60) percent of Americans want President Bush to sign the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act into law. More than 500 disease advocacy organizations, universities, professional societies and other organizations have endorsed S. 5 and the Stem cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   Embryonic stem cell research may hold great potential to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Scientific evidence indicates that stem cells provide powerful models of the cellular and molecular origins of many cancer types, helping us better understand the disease and provide insight into critical aspects of cell growth and differentiation altered during tumorigenesis. This work may also improve pre-clinical evaluations of drug toxicity and efficacy, identify markers for early cancer detection and aid in the discovery of novel treatment targets. 
   The Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation supports embryonic stem cell research, as well as other forms of stem cell research such as bone marrow stem cells, adult stem cells and stem cells derived from cord blood. 
   Embryonic stem cell research has the potential to benefit millions of Americans suffering from cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injury, heart disease and beyond. In order to realize the full potential of embryonic stem cell research, the Federal Government must act quickly to ensure that research is being conducted with the most scientifically viable stem cell lines available, that the best and brightest medical researchers and clinicians are involved in the field, and that the United States and top research institutions remain leaders in biomedical and regenerative medicine research.

   Ms. MATSUI. I want to thank my good friend from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for yielding me time. 
   I also want to thank Chairwoman McCarthy and Ranking Member Platts for their leadership in the committee and their tireless efforts to reauthorize and strengthen the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of those standing up in support of the first ever AmeriCorps Week. I believe strongly that the AmeriCorps program embodies the spirit of the American people, and it's important for Members of Congress to acknowledge the work accomplished by AmeriCorps members. 
   As a cochair of the National Service Caucus, it's a pleasure to highlight and honor the tremendous work of those involved at every level and every program of AmeriCorps. 
   AmeriCorps is a national service program that engages Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service. Since AmeriCorps was established in 1994, AmeriCorps members have performed over 630 million hours of service addressing a critical need in education, housing, public safety, disaster response and recovery and environmental preservation. 
   The AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, popularly known as NCCC, has a campus in my congressional district in Sacramento. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand how the experience positively influences the communities served by the team members and how it also enriches the lives of the participants. 
   Nearly everywhere I go in Sacramento someone stops me and tells me about how amazing and committed the NCCC members are to their mission. Most recently I have heard from AmeriCorps members about their experiences in the gulf coast recovery efforts. These participants all remarked that they are not just rebuilding communities, they are, quite literally, rebuilding people's lives. 
   It is because of all of the great work of AmeriCorps members that extraordinary things are happening all around America. Just last week, I learned that the Child Abuse Prevention Council, an important program in my district, will receive support from AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps members will serve as home visitors, resource aides and community coordinators. 
   There is nothing more important than our children, and I appreciate the Corporation for National and Community Service and for providing the program with 96 AmeriCorps members to help them carry out their mission. I know that we will be hearing more about the great work of AmeriCorps as the 110th Congress proceeds, and we consider reauthorization and funding. 
   AmeriCorps members are a vital part of our communities. With very little funding, they leverage millions of dollars and perform crucial work, whether in a classroom, in a national park, or rebuilding houses on the gulf coast. I truly hope that my colleagues will continue to support AmeriCorps programs. 
   The spirit of service that is so important in our communities is one that should be encouraged. I want to extend my greatest appreciation to those who have served and continue to serve in the AmeriCorps programs throughout the country.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me the time and for her outstanding leadership on our committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate is long overdue. There is no issue more serious or more urgent. The American people said loud and clear in the last election that they consider bringing this war to a close to be the singular imperative of their leaders. Yet rather than beginning to bring the troops home, the President has proposed escalating this conflict. 
   The American people deserve to know where their elected representatives stand on this, the most critical issue at this moment in history. This week the people will get their answer. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is where I stand: I opposed this war from the beginning, and I support several responsible proposals to bring this war to a close. I believe the President's proposed escalation would be a tragic mistake. It will most likely result in an increase in violence while only postponing the hard political choices the Iraqi people must make. It will also increase the strain on a military that is already stretched to the breaking point. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critically important to make clear that Iraq has spiraled into civil war because of the failure of this country's political leadership, not our troops. Our brave men  and women in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them. The real tragedy is how ill served they have been by their political leadership. 
   I have heard firsthand from many families in Sacramento the impact this has had on their lives. Linda, a concerned mother, told me about her son, Nicholas, who serves as an Army sergeant in the 82nd Airborne in Germany. Shortly, he will be returning to Iraq for his third tour. And there are some 30 soldiers in the Sacramento area who have died in this war. I have met several times with members of the National Guard and Reserve and their families. Every Member knows what I am talking about. We have all done it. We all know the pain. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, this administration has failed to meet the most basic requirements of responsible leadership. As a result, it has abdicated any claim to deference from this Chamber on this war and has certainly relinquished the moral authority to send men and women into this catastrophe. 
   Undoubtedly, this Chamber will need to take more forceful action if we are to bring this war to a conclusion. But today is an important first step. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to oppose this gravely mistaken proposal to escalate the war.  
   Mr. Speaker, this debate is long overdue. There is no issue more serious ..... or more urgent. The American People sent a message in the last election. That message was that they consider bringing this war to a close to be the singular imperative of their leaders. 
   Yet rather than beginning to bring troops home, the President has proposed escalating this conflict ..... sending tens of thousands of additional troops to Iraq. 
   Rather than change direction ..... they would instead continue down our current, disastrous path ..... only at a faster pace and with more human life placed in harm's way. 
   This week, every Member of the House of Representatives will have an opportunity to let their constituents know where they stand on the President's proposed escalation. That is only right. 
   The American people deserve to know where their elective representatives stand on this, the most critical issue at this moment of our history. 
   Mr. Speaker, here's where I stand. I opposed this war from the beginning, and I support several responsible proposals to bring this war to a close. 
   I believe the President's proposed escalation would be a tragic mistake. His stubborn insistence on pursuing the present course has been rejected by our military leaders ..... the independent Iraq study group ..... and a strong majority of the public. And with good reason. 
   This escalation will most likely result in an increase in violence while only postponing the hard political choices the Iraqi people must make. 
   Escalation of this conflict will also increase the strain on a military that is already stretched to the breaking point. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critically important to make clear that Iraq has spiraled into civil war because of the failure of this country's political leadership ..... not our troops. 
   Our brave men and women in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them. They courageously put their lives on the line every day for us. 
   The real tragedy is how ill-served our men and women in uniform have been by their political leadership. 
   I have heard firsthand from many families in Sacramento about the impact this has had on their lives. 
   In 2005, I spoke with a group of women whose husbands were serving in the National Guard in Iraq. 
   One woman told me she bought her husband a Kevlar vest before he deployed ..... something all too many families were doing for their loved ones because the military wasn't providing it. Imagine the stress ..... sending a loved one into danger without the confidence that he would be given the needed equipment for protection. 
   And I have heard countless stories about the hardships being created by the multiple tours this conflict has demanded. 
   Linda, a concerned mother from Sacramento, told me about her son, Nicholas, who serves as an Army sergeant in the 82nd Airborne in Germany. He lives on-base with his wife and two children, ages four and five. Another child is on the way. 
   Nicholas recently learned that he was going to have to return to Iraq for his third tour. 
   Linda wrote me and said that his family ..... and I'm quoting ..... ``..... will be all alone in Germany when he leaves and each time he has gone, the children have terrible nightmares and anger issues because they do not understand the long separations.'' 
   Another Sacramento couple that wrote me are the proud parents of three Army soldiers ..... one is currently serving his second tour in Iraq ..... the other two have already completed two tours in Iraq. They ask ..... will their sons be asked to go back a third time? 
   My friend Richard Beach served as a chaplain in the U.S. Army Reserves in Iraq. Richard served in Iraq early in the conflict, and realized that four years since he went there, many of his fellow reservists are still serving there. 
   Richard shared with me a note he sent to some of his fellow members of the 114th. He wrote ..... and I quote ..... ``I remember four years ago we were getting ready for our trip to Fort Lewis and then on to Iraq. I hope as the fourth anniversary of the war comes up you are all in good health and living life to the fullest. I too pray that soon this war will end, and we will stop sending our soldiers off to war.'' 
   Four years later ..... and still many of the same soldiers and their families are making the same sacrifice. But that is the heartbreaking reality here. 
   There are some 30 soldiers in the Sacramento area who have died in this war. I've met several times with members of the National Guard and Reserve and their families. Every member knows what I am talking about. We've all done it. We all know the pain. 
   The notion of ``shared sacrifice'' is something that helped make this country great. 
   But with this administration ..... only our soldiers and their families share in the sacrifice. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that this country has tried troop increases before ..... to no avail. Sadly, this administration simply lacks credibility when arguing that this proposal will work. 
   As a result of this administration's failure to meet the most basic requirements of responsible leadership, it has abdicated any claim to deference from this chamber on this war ..... and it has certainly relinquished the moral authority to send additional men and women into this catastrophe. 
   Today's step is only a first step. Undoubtedly, this chamber will need to take more forceful action if we are to bring this war to a conclusion. But it is an important first step. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution ..... and to oppose this gravely mistaken proposal to escalate the war.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, the bill before us today is a good one. I would like to commend Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, Chairman Gordon and Chairman Wu for their hard work on this timely legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, in many cities and towns across the country, business incubators provide a valuable service. They help young businesses survive and grow. 
   They provide guidance, business tools, space, contacts, and the know-how to run a company. Incubators can dramatically increase the success of new companies. Across the United States, incubators have already nurtured tens of thousands of new companies to great success. Their efforts have helped grow our economy and create both jobs and profit. 
   In these challenging economic times, a good idea is often not enough to guarantee success. Many young companies need further business expertise in order to avoid failing. 
   In my hometown of Sacramento, the CleanStart incubator is helping grow a whole suite of clean energy companies. These businesses are developing the cutting-edge technologies that will power our economy and protect our environment in the future. 
   However, many businesses receiving SBIR grants devote most of their capital to research. This leaves little left over for business development. These are the type of businesses that can benefit most from the services provided by incubators. 
   My amendment ensures that SBIR dollars will continue to work with incubators across the country to drive economic development. It will allow incubators to do what they do best, translate good research conducted by small businesses into commercial technologies that create jobs and economic growth. I urge all Members to support this commonsense amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. 
   There was no objection. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I thank the gentlewoman from California for her amendment and her efforts to improve this bill. H.R. 5819 directs Federal agencies to establish initiatives by which agencies encourage partnerships between SBIR awardees and prime contractors, venture capital firms and larger businesses. The purpose of these partnerships is to help awardees progress toward phase III of the SBIR program. 
   The amendment highlights the significant role that business incubators can play for small firms as they work to commercialize their research. It is completely appropriate for Federal agencies to acknowledge business incubators as valuable partners with SBIR awardees. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Missouri for any comments he may have.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3688, UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 801 provides for consideration of H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, under the closed rule required by the fast track law. The rule provides for a total of 3 hours of debate, equally divided by proponents and opponents of the underlying bill. 
   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. I want to congratulate Chairman Rangel, Chairman Levin and members of the Ways and Means Committee on bringing this trade agreement before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week we passed legislation to help strengthen our current trade adjustment assistance program to protect American workers. Our country faces increased pressure as a result of globalization, and we must continue to reaffirm our commitment to the American workforce. It is evident that we need to change our current trade strategy. 
   At the same time, we must also acknowledge the positive impact that international trade has had on our economy. International trade currently accounts for a quarter of our gross domestic product. 
   Competition has proven to spur innovation and create new jobs. In my home State of California, we know that our IT companies need exports of semiconductor chips. Our farmers need the markets of Europe, Asia and Latin America. And our entertainment industry, financial services and telecom companies need to sell their services to grow and create jobs. 
   But it also affects industry in America. We know that, and that is why we have a balanced approach to our trade agreements. 
   Mr. Speaker, the trade agreement before us today is part of the broad context in which we should consider trade policy. It will establish an important precedent for how we craft future trade agreements. 
   Under the new Democratic Congress, free trade agreements must provide strong labor and environmental protections. They are essential to promoting healthy workplaces and competition for American employees and around the world. 
   Congress must consider each agreement on its merits. In some cases, these agreements will meet increased access for American producers and service providers. In other cases, these agreements could mean more competition and would significantly impact our workers and communities. 
   I understand that many of my colleagues have strong views on trade, but one thing we can all agree on and be proud of is the fact that our leadership worked vigorously to ensure that democratic principles were included in the Peru agreement. 
   In previous free trade agreements, these principles were noticeably absent. The initial Peru Free Trade Agreement draft reflected the ``business as usual'' approach that this administration has based its trade policies on. Democratic leadership went to Peru, met with the Peruvian president and prominent members of its Congress and developed a new free trade agreement, one that includes the strongest labor and environmental chapters in any of the world's over 300 bilateral free trade agreements. 
   It is not CAFTA. This is the first free trade agreement of its kind. It is a new free trade agreement, one that incorporates fully enforceable internationally recognized labor standards; that also promotes international environmental standards, including combating illegal logging, protecting the ozone layer, and our oceans; and an agreement that will provide Peruvians with lifesaving medicines. All three provisions are unprecedented in any free trade agreement and all three are core democratic principles that we should all be proud of. 
   This agreement is also about leveling the playing field for U.S. companies to compete in the Peruvian market. The Andean Trade Preference Act passed in 1991 and expanded in 2001 allowed Peruvian companies to benefit from duty-free trade with the United States. Meanwhile, U.S. goods exported to Peru continued to face tariffs as high as 12 percent. 
   The agreement before us today will give U.S. businesses immediate, duty-free access for more than 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods. This agreement will also allow us to forge a closer alliance and relationship with one of our southern neighbors. It is no secret that other countries are investing heavily in that part of the world. This agreement will send a strong message to our southern neighbors that the United States is here to help promote openness in their government and their economy. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to look at each free trade agreement based on its merits. It is easy to promote or oppose free trade unequivocally and not look at the facts of each agreement. I am confident that this agreement will benefit our Nation, benefit our workers, and benefit our businesses. This agreement will serve as a model free trade agreement for years to come.  
   Once again, I want to congratulate Mr. Rangel and Mr. Levin for their hard work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement represents a new kind of policy, a new generation of free trade agreements. Since World War II, our international trade policy has been driven by a broad commitment to expanding economic opportunity for Americans. Producers from across the country must have access to international markets to stay competitive in an increasingly global economy. 
   However, we must carefully construct each agreement in a way that is fair, sound and beneficial to all countries involved. The administration's initial agreement with Peru was none of the above. I am proud that our leadership took an unprecedented and hands-on approach to ensure that this particular agreement incorporated the values and principles of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, this agreement is different than previous agreements. The labor and environmental protections in this agreement are stronger than any other previous free trade agreement. As our Nation's trade policy moves forward, I urge our colleagues to consider each potential free trade agreement on its merits. We cannot dwell on past flawed agreements. We must look toward the future with full confidence in our companies and in our workers and say that American products can compete with anyone, anywhere, at any time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must lead by example, and I commend Mr. Rangel and Mr. Levin for the diligent work on this agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2641, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2008. The bill today is being considered under an open rule. The issues of energy and water are always important, but this year these issues are the very center of our national dialogue.  
   I applaud Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for their continued commitment to provide the resources for our water infrastructure. This investment protects communities and saves lives. 
   I feel I could speak directly to this because in my home, Sacramento, this bill is arguably more important to the everyday life and safety of our population than nearly any bill this Congress will pass. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city for catastrophic flooding in this country. 
   My district serves as the seat of government for California, the sixth largest economy in the world, as well as the hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people. A major flood along the American and Sacramento rivers would have catastrophic ripple effects regionally and nationally, cause upwards of $35 billion in direct property damage, and likely result in significant loss of life to our families, our friends, and neighbors. 
   Sacramento needs this bill, but so do countless other communities across the Nation. I remember all too well on New Year's Eve of 2005 when the headline in our local paper said: ``North State braces as rains' onslaught arrives.'' My district and I sat on the edge of our seats and held our breath to see how the storm would unfold. 
   Flooding did occur, and for those that endured it, it was tragic. But the majority of Sacramento was spared. Our flood system performed as it should, but it was definitely put to the test. Bolstering our system, working through this bill, and with the Army Corps of Engineers made our survival during that storm possible. 
   Locally, on a daily basis, we are working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the State of California and the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency, our local partner, to achieve greater flood protection. We have achieved impressive results by integrating an approach that combines flood protection and dam safety with partners that can share resources. But what makes an approach like this possible are strong partnerships between the Federal Government, the States, and local entities. 
   I am pleased that this bill strengthens and supports this and other similar partnerships. Another key component of this bill is funding for the Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance funding account. This important increase will begin to address billions of dollars in Army Corps maintenance backlogs.     
   This bill takes on the responsibility of not only building but also maintaining our infrastructure and makes an investment in securing our communities, property and, most important, lives. 
   As our country witnessed in the devastation in New Orleans, maintaining our infrastructure is an important function of the Corps that we cannot afford to overlook. 
   It is vital that the Federal Government continue to be a strong partner for these ongoing water infrastructure and flood protection investments. This will allow at-risk communities across the country to strengthen their vulnerable points. It will protect jobs and it will protect lives. There are few investments as worthwhile as this. 
   Just as we must invest in our country's water infrastructure, we must also implement a clean energy economy. This starts with weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rising price of gas is well documented. In many communities gas prices are monitored more closely than the stock prices. Mr. Speaker, I stood here 1 year ago to manage the rule for last year's Energy and Water appropriations bill. During last year's debate I noted that the average cost of a gallon of gasoline was $2.93. Last year, there appeared to be no end in sight to rising prices. 
   Unfortunately, we have not seen much improvement at the pump. In fact what has changed has done so for the worst. According to AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas today is $3.06. In my hometown of Sacramento, it's $3.19. Many of us are probably asking, has energy policy improved? 
   To begin with, Chairman Visclosky has recentered our priorities with this appropriations bill. We are now investing in renewable energy research. We are finally reducing our dependence on foreign oil and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. We are finally protecting our national energy security. Chairman Visclosky and Chairman Obey should be commended for these improvements. 
   These investments are long overdue, Mr. Speaker. They support our States and cities. For example, in my home State of California, we have plans to create a 20 percent renewable portfolio standard within the next decade. 
   These increased investments in energy programs contrast greatly with the President's priorities. Incredibly, the President's total request for renewable energy and energy efficiency is the same as it was in 2001. 
   During this President's entire administration, his goals and priorities have not changed. This is in spite of the everyday reminders of rising gas prices and the constant stream of evidence that our world is warming. 
   I applaud Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for their leadership in this area. They have set a responsible and innovative course with these priorities. 
   Finally, as I mentioned at the outset of this debate, this bill is being made in order under an open rule, which is our tradition. I hope that all Members will give that tradition the respect it deserves. 
   The American people want action on energy policy, climate change, flood protection and a number of issues that this bill funds. Let's let the process work, and let's support this responsible bill. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the underlying Energy and Water appropriations bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me time and I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I listened to my constituents' concerns about this rescue plan and throughout this debate it has become clear that Congress must act to restore our credit markets. If we don't, we risk further putting jobs and the financial security of hardworking Americans at risk. Small businesses will have a difficult time making payroll to pay their employees. Hardworking Americans will see their savings and retirement funds diminish. Americans will have a difficult time buying a home, sending their children to college or just making ends meet. This plan is a revised plan. It's not the same three-page plan the Secretary of the Treasury brought to us. It is not simply a blank check to Wall Street. 
   I am glad that this plan includes many safeguards that are important to my constituents: 
   Independent oversight board to ensure transparency and accountability of taxpayer money. 
   A plan to help foreclosures that are devastating our families, neighbors and communities. And we will also do more beyond this, too. Limits on excessive compensation for CEOs and executives. And allowing taxpayers to share in any profits resulting from the government's help. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not a perfect plan and I know it's going to be a hard vote, but the risk of inaction is too great.

   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin today by thanking my colleagues, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad. Their advocacy on this issue has been truly remarkable. 
   We held a field hearing in my district last year on mental health. It provided my constituents with a forum for important dialogue about an issue that affects millions of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, anyone who has had a family member with a mental illness knows how difficult living with the disease can be for everyone involved. They also know one thing above all else: physical illness and mental illness are equally painful and equally challenging. In many ways, mental health patients suffer more because our insurance system discriminates against them. That is why this legislation is so important, because it is about people, people who struggle with mental illness every day and every night, people who suffer in silence without a doctor's help because their insurance will not cover mental health or addiction treatments. 
   This House has the chance to demonstrate its compassion and commitment to these people, Mr. Speaker. With one vote, we can put behind us the false conception that mental illness is not as serious as cancer or diabetes or many other diseases covered by health insurance plans. 
   On the contrary, mental illnesses are some of the most serious health conditions we face. The battle against them has been enormously difficult for millions of families across our Nation. 
   It has been tough, but this is a battle that we must win, Mr. Speaker. With mental health parity, it is a battle we can and will win. 
   Again, I thank Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad for their courageous commitment to this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 683 provides for consideration of H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007, under a structured rule. As the Clerk reported, the rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule also makes in order a substitute reported by the Committee on Financial Services modified by the amendment in part A of the Rules Committee report as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. The self-executing amendment in part A would ensure that the bill complies with the new PAYGO requirements. 
   The rule makes in order the 13 amendments printed in the Rules Committee report, with each amendment debatable for 10 minutes. 
   As yesterday's debate in the Rules Committee demonstrated, Members on both sides of the aisle are focused on getting this bill to conference and onto the President's desk, and this bill reflects that consensus. 
   As a Representative of a district in a floodplain, I understand the need for a healthy flood insurance program. My hometown of Sacramento is the most at-risk river city in the Nation. Whenever I talk about our efforts to improve Sacramento's level of flood protection, I also mention the importance of flood insurance. If you live behind a levee, you should have flood insurance. And the Federal Government has the responsibility to promote this kind of coverage. 
   I also recognize that to accomplish this, we need a healthy and robust national flood insurance program. That is why legislation we debate today, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act, is so significant. Through this legislation, we will meet our responsibilities, we will ensure coverage is available to those at risk, and we will educate those same individuals as to the benefits of flood insurance. This bill, which was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by a bipartisan majority of 38-29, takes us in that positive direction. 
   In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the deficiencies in the program were laid bare. What remained was a program $25 million in debt with a questionable future. It is imperative that we rebuild and reform the Federal flood insurance program. 
   For many Americans, owning insurance to protect against a flood is more valuable than coverage in case of fire. That is because homes in a designated special flood hazard area are almost three times as likely to be destroyed by a flood as by fire, and this is a case for almost three-fourths of all homes in Sacramento. This is an important program that must be reformed to ensure its long-term stability and solvency. 
   The bill we are considering today makes reasonable reforms and lays the foundation for a stronger and improved flood insurance program, and for that I would like to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK and Chairwoman Waters for their leadership on the bill.  
   This bill takes important steps to modernize the flood insurance program. It raises maximum coverage limits to keep up with inflation. It provides new coverage for living expenses if you have to vacate your home. And it also provides optional coverage for basements and business interruption coverage for commercial properties. These are all positive steps that will allow the program to continue to provide peace of mind to those impacted when a flood occurs. 
   In moving forward, Congress is also making the flood insurance program sustainable. The bill tightens enforcement of purchase requirements and adds subsidies on vacation homes, second homes, and businesses. While these actions may not be popular, this will help invigorate the program in the long run. 
   In addition to helping homeowners, this measure will also benefit taxpayers nationwide by preventing insurance companies from putting their liability on the Federal Government at the expense of the American public. 
   By identifying flood hazards, managing floodplains via land use controls and building requirements, and providing insurance protections, this essential program reduces flood loss expenses to the Federal Government, saving taxpayers an estimated $1 billion a year. 
   This measure provides much-needed reforms to restore solvency to a program that has faced unprecedented financial strain in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes. This bill increases accountability of federally regulated lenders by imposing stricter penalties on those lenders that fail to enforce mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements on mortgage holders. This takes our country in the right direction by encouraging individuals to purchase flood insurance, while also addressing the needs of the program. 
   I would also like to express my sincere thanks for Chairman Frank for working with me this past year on issues that I believe make this a stronger overall bill. I appreciate the chairman including my legislation, the Flood Insurance Community Outreach Grant Program Act of 2007, in this bill. 
   This grant program works. A little over two years ago, with the support of a $162,000 FEMA grant, my local flood protection body, the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency, conducted just a flood insurance outreach initiative. SAFCA reached out to more than 45,000 NFIP policyholders in the American River floodplain with impressive results. After a year, 74 percent maintained their flood insurance policies. Of this group, 43 percent now carry preferred risk flood insurance. Preferred risk policies provide property owners who are protected by a levee or other flood mitigation method with full flood insurance at a reduced price. Because of their lower price, these preferred-risk policies have a higher level of policy retention. 
   To put this success in perspective, FEMA more than recouped its investment. SAFCA exceeded its target for policies retained more than 20 times over, adding millions to the flood insurance program's bottom line. 
   Extending these grants to other floodplains will only strengthen and build the solvency of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   In short, I truly believe we must encourage greater participation in NFIP rather than providing loopholes for people not to participate. On that note, I would also like to thank the chairman for including language that authorizes a study for future participation of low-income individuals who live in a floodplain. We have an obligation to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to be insured and has access to affordable flood insurance. This is an important issue that I look forward to working on with the chairman, the committee, and many of my colleagues in further addressing this policy issue. 
   I think it is important that we continue to modernize our flood insurance program. I am pleased that the committee kept the amendment from last Congress' flood insurance bill, language that simply asks that FEMA utilize emerging weather forecasting technology as they update our national flood maps. Moving forward, we must make the investment in weather forecasting technology so that we have the tools to adjust to the changing climate. FEMA needs to be prepared to utilize this technology as it becomes available to us. We must ensure that FEMA has the highest quality information when it works to determine the level of risk for vulnerable geographies. This policy initiative takes us in a positive direction. 
   Finally, the bill we are debating today is a vital tool to be used after a flooding incident occurs. We need this bill; however, I want to close by saying that flood insurance is one piece of what should be a national comprehensive flood protection approach. Congress must continue to provide the tools and policy for prevention. We must continue to provide the funding for our flood protection infrastructure projects, and we must continue to provide the authorization for the projects that provide the protection for our communities.     
   With these policies of prevention in place, it will make communities safer and reduce the likelihood of our communities having to utilize their flood insurance policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the underlying Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, the earmark rule is not waived in this rule despite the claims of my colleagues. I urge them to read page 2, lines 6 and 7, that the earmark rule specifically excludes the earmark rule from the waiver. Any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue. 
   Additionally, the Rules Committee took testimony yesterday on this bill. Unfortunately, some of the Members who spoke today didn't even come to testify on their amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the National Flood Insurance Program in a positive direction. This bill takes important steps to modernize the flood insurance program. This bill has bipartisan support. It raises maximum coverage limits to keep up with inflation; it provides new coverage for living expenses if you have to vacate your home; and, moving forward, Congress is making the flood insurance program sustainable in the long run. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are all positive steps that allow the program to continue to provide peace of mind to those impacted when a flood event occurs. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3920, TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Rangel and members of the Ways and Means Committee on bringing this bill before us. 
   In 1962, Congress and President Kennedy created the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to protect American workers and communities adversely impacted by international trade.     
   Back then, our Nation enjoyed a large trade surplus, our manufacturing industry was thriving, and our economy was moving forward. 
   By establishing the TAA program then, our Nation had the foresight to recognize that even when economic times were good, international trade and development could also cause a rift in our workforce and in our communities. 
   Now it is our time to provide the foresight for future generations of workers and companies who will face the continued pressure of globalization. The mark of a strong Nation is this ability to create a vision for itself and to adapt to that vision. 
   Like our economy, the TAA must change and evolve to meet the new challenges of the day. Under current law, the TAA program only offers benefits to those workers who lost their jobs in the manufacturing industry due to international trade. 
   Today, no sector in our economy is safe from outsourcing or trade activities. We are seeing IT jobs, call center jobs, and other U.S. service jobs move abroad. 
   Our commitment to the American worker is more important now than ever before. It is critical to continue to improve the benefits for displaced workers. But it is also essential that we not ignore other sectors of the economy that have been hard hit by outsourcing or trade competition. 
   That is why I'm pleased that the bill before us today expands current TAA coverage to include the service workers. More than 70 percent of our workforce today is in the service industry. Updating the TAA program to reflect this shift in the workforce is essential to the long-term health of our country. 
   This bill also improves health care benefits in the TAA program to make it a more affordable option for our workers. This bill also doubles the current funding to better train and relocate displaced workers. 
   Madam Speaker, the impact of globalization on our economy is not limited to workers. These affected workers reside in communities that experience massive job losses due to unfair trade practices. This bill attempts to help those communities get back on their feet. 
   Now more than ever, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is needed to position our workforce and economy at the forefront of an increasingly global economy. This bill moves us forward in the right direction. 
   Madam Speaker, Congress needs to be a partner to the communities in which we serve. This bill lays the groundwork for that. The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007 represents a big step in the right direction.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Department of Homeland Security made significant changes to our homeland security effort. They announced that for the first time areas such as Sacramento, San Diego and Las Vegas were at risk of losing their UASI grant funds. 
   Since learning of the changes to the UASI program, my colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our most at-risk urban areas receive the funding they deserve. As a result, DHS has modified the UASI grant process. DHS's formula now includes more critical infrastructure such as dams and levees, and has also added a tiered system. 
   While I am glad that my work has ensured that Sacramento and other at-risk urban areas are eligible to apply for UASI funding this year, I believe my work is not done. 
   I have spent much of my time in the district working closely with local law enforcement and first responders of homeland security. I have seen firsthand the tremendous efforts to protect the millions of people living in the Sacramento area from a terrorist attack. 
   In Sacramento, I had the honor of attending the opening of the Sacramento Regional Homeland Security and Training Center. The new center was built using a wide range of Federal homeland security funding, including UASI. The center will improve intelligence sharing by housing all levels of law enforcement in one facility. This is just further proof of the truly unparalleled regional cooperation among Sacramento's law enforcement and first responders. 
   I have long been impressed by the local law enforcement and first responders in my community, and throughout the country. Now we need to make sure that Congress is giving them the necessary resources to do their job.  
   And so my colleagues, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Fossella, Mr. Mr. Garrett and I have offered an amendment to add $50 million to the UASI grant program. 
   While I commend the chairman and the ranking member for adding $30 million to the program, I believe an additional $50 million is warranted. Our first responders and law enforcement tackle impossible tasks daily. This increased funding will help in pursuit of their mission, to keep our country safe and secure. 
   Finally, I would like to add to what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) has said about the issue of revenue sharing. I, too, don't think this is an appropriate place for semantics. The point is, this grant program and the criteria for receiving funding is predicated on the assessment of risk and a community's vulnerability. I would argue that with the UASI program, the issue is not cost sharing but risk sharing. I think this is an appropriate role for the Federal Government in the post-9/11 world. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1852, EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, as the Clerk just read, H. Res. 650 provides for consideration of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate to be controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule makes in order seven amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   This bill is being considered under a structured rule that will allow the House to consider amendments to address important issues with regard to this legislation. I look forward to the debate on the important issue before us today. 
   I rise today in support of the rule providing for the consideration of the Expanding American Homeownership Act and for the underlying legislation. I thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters for offering this bill. I thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their hard work, along with the other members of the Financial  Services Committee, in bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
   The bill underlying this house resolution addresses an issue of critical importance to our constituents and to our economy, the subprime mortgage lending crisis. We are here today to consider reforming the Federal Housing Administration's loan policies as a means of stemming the tide of foreclosures that have besieged our Nation. 
   Owning a home is part of the American Dream, but predatory lenders have been crushing that dream by taking advantage of home buyers with damaged credit. Lured by attractive initial terms, vulnerable home buyers who do not qualify for federally backed loans take on subprime mortgage loans that they cannot afford. These loans come with escalating interest rates which start low and encourage overborrowing. The borrowers learn too late, when their homes are foreclosed upon, that they will not be able to afford those higher payments. 
   We are now faced with the unfortunate situation that our residents are losing their homes in record numbers. The increasing rate of foreclosure continues to make the news in California and across the Nation. Data released just last month show the rising foreclosure rates in cities across the country. The numbers are as high as one foreclosure in every 27 households. That is not acceptable. 
   And the housing market continues to suffer. Last week a report from my Sacramento district cited a more than 13 percent drop in the median home prices in the past year. That is the largest 1-year drop in 20 years.     
   Despite good economic growth in the region, the housing market is in trouble. Many point to the subprime mortgage crisis to explain this. Trends like this can be seen across the country, not just in Sacramento. 
   The administration wants to allow 80,000 people to refinance their loans through FHA. That is good but it is not going to address the scope of this problem. More than 2 million adjustable rate mortgages are up for reset this fall, at which time their interest rates will increase. Two million mortgages, that is 2 million more families who will be at risk at losing their homes if they cannot keep up with the higher payments. This pattern cannot continue. 
   The housing market crunch, driven by the subprime mortgage lending troubles, is making waves throughout our economy. Over the past few months, we have seen the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate and make an additional $62 billion available to try to stabilize the real estate financial market. Last month, Countrywide Financial, the largest home mortgage lender, was trading at levels comparable to junk bonds. And, lastly, AIG, the world's largest insurer and one of the biggest mortgage lenders, stated that delinquencies and foreclosures are becoming more common among borrowers whose credit rates are just above subprime. So the problem is getting worse, not better. Congress needs to act and we need to act now. 
   The bill we are considering today will overhaul the Federal Housing Administration to make federally backed loans competitive with subprime and other nontraditional mortgage loans. We need to make sure that subprime mortgages are properly regulated to get our home buyers into good loans and rein in predatory lenders. The bill authorizes FHA to offer loans with little or no down payment and directs it to approve loans to borrowers with higher credit risk than is currently allowed. These measures will enable FHA to compete with the introductory teaser rates advertised by subprime lenders. 
   The bill will raise the single-family loan limit, enabling families who live in more expensive areas, such as California, to qualify for FHA-backed loans. The FHA has virtually no presence in expensive areas where the average price of a home already exceeds the FHA loan limit. Increasing access to FHA-backed loans will give many thousands of our constituents the stable financing terms that they need to keep up with their payments and stave off foreclosure. 
   Furthermore, this bill offers relief to our seniors. Seniors are often targeted by subprime loans, especially for reverse mortgages. Seniors who own their homes but who have limited financial resources might need to mortgage their homes to pay for other expenses. This bill eliminates the cap on FHA reverse mortgages to meet with growing needs of our seniors in tight financial times. 
   Finally, the legislation directs surplus FHA funds to a housing counseling program as well as to an affordable housing fund. In this way the legislation will ensure that borrowers have the opportunity to achieve the dream of owning a home as well as to become educated about their mortgage options and what it will mean in the long term. 
   The mortgage lending troubles are getting out of control. This bill will take an important first step toward reining in a disturbingly high rate of foreclosure. Later this week Chairman Frank will hold a hearing with Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and other administration officials to look for additional legislative and regulatory solutions to this growing problem. Ensuring that FHA lending policies are up to date and competitive in the current market is a good start. 
   This bill will ensure that our fellow Americans have better federally backed choices to buy a home. This bill will curtail the spread of subprime lending and get more of our homeowners into mortgage loans with stable interest rates and transparent terms. This is a step in the right direction. 
   This is a bipartisan issue. The House passed similar legislation in the 109th Congress. This bill expands upon that legislation, reflective of the growing crisis. We need to pass this bill. Our constituents need this bill to keep their homes, and we need to work with our colleagues in the Senate to get this bill to the President. 
   I look forward to the debate on the Expanding Homeownership Act and hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Before yielding to my next speaker, I would like to point out that the bill directs surplus funds to an affordable housing fund. This is an appropriate  use of any net FHA funds. The surplus funds are directed to a source that is consistent with the mission of this legislation: to help Americans buy homes through federally backed means. 
   However, for those Members who do not support this fund, I want to point out that there is an amendment made in order to strike the fund. All Members of this House will have an opportunity to vote on this important issue.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I just want to make a comment that H.R. 1852 already has strong identification requirements for those applying for FHA-backed mortgage insurance.  
   With that, Mr. Speaker, we know that our housing market is in severe distress. We must ensure that subprime mortgage lending is not putting our residents at risk. Subprime mortgages can be a very useful tool enabling those with imperfect credit to qualify to buy a home. Reining in predatory lending practices will help our families keep those homes that they have worked so hard to buy. The Expanding American Homeownership Act will ensure that FHA has the tools it needs to get more home buyers into good loans. 
   This bill will bring the FHA regulations up to date. It will provide the agency with the ability and resources to offer a broader diversity of loans to meet the needs of the current market. This is an important bill that will give more of our constituents access to solid federally backed loans. That is a kind of stable financing that homeowners need to get through the rocky times our real estate market is weathering. 
   The Financial Services Committee has worked very hard to get this bill to the floor. I hope that we can keep it moving forward. I hope that my colleagues will join me and show strong bipartisan support for the rule before us and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3043, DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 547 provides for consideration of H.R. 3043, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Act for 2008 under an open rule. Under this rule, all Members of the House are afforded the opportunity to offer any amendment that is germane and otherwise complies with House rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, the phrase most often associated with this bill has been ``feast or famine.'' For instance, Congress first doubled funding for the National Institutes of Health between 1999 and 2003 and then flat-lined the agency's funds since then. It was actually cut for the first time in history in fiscal year 2006. 
   In contrast, this year's bill sticks to the principle of sustainable growth in strategic areas: health research, worker safety and education. I would like to applaud Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh for their hard work in crafting this fair and responsible blueprint for our Nation's future. 
   Nowhere is this broader strategy of sustainable growth more evident than at the NIH. The underlying legislation provides a modest 2.6 percent increase over last year's level. Such an increase is critical to maintaining America's global leadership in biomedical research. This research will expand the boundaries of human knowledge and keep America at the forefront of the field. 
   Unfortunately, low or frozen funding levels resulted in almost 1,300 fewer grants from 2003 to 2006. But this year's sustainable increase will allow those grants to expand responsibly. 
   In particular, I would like to thank the committee for its continued support of the National Children's Study. Its budget within the NIH is very modest, but its impact to children and families will be great. The study will examine environmental effects on childhood development, including autism, asthma and premature birth. For several years, I've been working with the committee and other Members to provide the study with proper support. I'm happy to report that the study has now received widespread and bipartisan support. 
   I'd also like to highlight the full funding of Ryan White AIDS programs within the bill. Cities and towns all across the country rely on these funds to provide vital health services to individuals with HIV or AIDS. With this funding, the victims of HIV and AIDS will have increased access to medications, primary care and home health care. 
   In addition to ensuring health care access and advancement, this bill also plans for our children's educational future. 
   We all realize that the cost of a college education is not getting any cheaper. In fact, it's growing by thousands of dollars a year. So I commend the committee's increase in the maximum Pell Grant by $390 to $4,700. It will permit over 5.5 million students to take advantage of this critical assistance, and it does so without having to reduce other student financial assistance programs, as the administration had proposed. 
   The underlying legislation also acts responsibly to prepare our Nation's students before they get to college by ensuring better performance at the K-12 grade levels. 
   Title I grants support schools in high-poverty areas, and they are the engine behind No Child Left Behind. Nonetheless, these grants have been flat-funded or even reduced in the past two school years. This has hindered the ability of title I schools to assist low-performing students. I commend the committee for increasing this fund so that nearly 55,000 title I schools can invest in their young people. 
   Make no mistake, in a world that increasingly depends on highly skilled employees, this legislation is an investment in the future of our students and in the future competitiveness of this Nation. 
   In conclusion, I urge all Members to support this rule and the underlying bill. It deals responsibly with the needs of our health care sector, our education system, and the labor market. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I'd just like to make a few comments before I yield to the next speaker. 
   I'd like to say that the President's budget would have cut education programs, health care programs, energy assistance for seniors, avian flu by some $7.6 billion below last year after adjusted for inflation. This bill rejects most of those arbitrary cuts. As a result, some Members have criticized it. 
   But the bill only increases these funds by a modest 3 percent after adjusting for inflation and population growth. This increase puts the bill a full $2.9 billion below its funding level in 2005. It is interesting logic that when you're spending less than you did 2 years ago, it's out-of-control spending. 
   The subcommittee's ranking member testified to the Rules Committee last night that he would have written a very similar bill as Mr. Obey did had he been in the chairman's seat. And most of the amendments offered in committee were by the minority seeking to increase various funding levels in the bill. 
   This bill funds our Nation's health care, education and worker protection programs in a responsible, sustainable manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 547 is an open rule providing for consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. 
   The underlying legislation puts many of this Nation's most critical agencies on a responsible and sustainable funding path. Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh should be commended. As the Rules Committee heard in their testimony yesterday, they worked in a cooperative manner without partisan rancor to balance many competing needs funded through this bill. 
   This bill strengthens our families and prepares our workforce for the challenges that lay ahead. For instance, in just 7 years, nearly half of all the Nation's job growth will be concentrated in occupations requiring a college degree. This bill helps prepare our young people for this new world by increasing funding for students at K-12 or college level. In particular, it rejects an administration proposal to freeze Pell Grants. Instead, this legislation increases Pell Grants by $390 to $4,700 on top of a $260 increase provided in 2007 continuing appropriations resolution. These efforts will make great strides in making college more affordable. 
   The legislation also maintains our Nation's leadership in health care research by lifting a 2-year freeze on the average cost of new research grants to NIH, and it provides a responsible increase in employment, training and worker protection programs. These are just some of the ways in which the underlying legislation provides millions of Americans with access to affordable health care, a decent education, and strong worker protection. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this open rule and the underlying bill. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, I am, as many in this Chamber are, a proud parent and almost embarrassingly proud grandparent. All parents and grandparents are different, of course, but I believe almost all of us share one thing in common, and that is a hope that our children and our grandchildren will have a chance to do a little better, to go a little further, to have a little easier time than their parents and grandparents. That aspiration has a name in this country; it is called the American Dream. And the American people understand that education is the key to making that dream a reality. 
   Today, we consider legislation to combat a very real threat to that dream. The unfortunate reality is that skyrocketing college costs are putting a college education out of reach for many middle class families. Tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation since 2001. At private universities, tuition has increased by 17 percent after inflation. It is worth repeating because it is truly shocking: these figures are after inflation. 
   Indeed, according to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial barriers will prevent almost 4 1/2 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade, and prevent another 2 million from attending any college at all. Those statistics are very sobering, and the sound they make is that of the door of opportunity being closed on many young people. 
   That is why I am very pleased that our congressional leadership has made cutting interest rates on student loans one of its top priorities for the first 100 hours of this Congress. 
   The legislation being considered today will cut interest rates for subsidized student loans in half over the next 5 years from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent.     
   As a result, we will help around 5.5 million more students afford college. 
   Mr. Speaker, my constituents are demanding quick action on this legislation, and with good reason. With Sacramento State University in my district and the University of California at Davis nearby, they are all too aware of the impact rising tuition costs are having on students and their families. 
   A recent study demonstrated that this legislation would, on average, save the average student borrower in California starting school this year almost $2,500 over the life of the loan. For students beginning college in the year 2011, the legislation will save almost $5,000. We will need to do more to make college affordable, but my constituents in Sacramento who are struggling to afford college will welcome this very important first step. 
   Mr. Speaker, helping all qualified students attend college is essential for our economy, for our competitiveness and for our future; but not only that, it is essential for ensuring that the American Dream remains a reality for our young people. That is why there is a remarkable consensus supporting this proposal across our country. 
   Newsweek reports that 88 percent of the country supports this legislation, including wide majorities of both Democrats and Republicans. We are not talking about the Democratic dream or the Republican dream, but the American Dream. 
   Further, this legislation meets our pay-as-you-go requirements and, therefore, will not add to our budget deficit. Fully five of six of the offsets have been approved previously by the Bush administration or Republican congressional leaders. That, again, is a remarkable consensus. It is now time to act. 
   All too often the American people look at Congress and they hear a lot of argument and see a lot of activity, but wonder though what Congress is doing to improve their lives. If we act on this legislation quickly, however, students will start to see a difference as soon as July 1. So let us surprise our skeptics, take action, and pass this legislation now on a bipartisan basis.  
   It has been gratifying to be a Member of Congress for the first few weeks of this Congress, which by wide bipartisan majorities has increased the minimum wage, approved potentially life-saving research and enacted genuinely bipartisan recommendations to improve our Nation's security. 
   Our first 100 hours has been a good time for the middle class and for Americans who favor progress over partisanship. This legislation is another such opportunity. Americans of every political stripe understand that if we allow college education to become too expensive for hardworking and qualified middle class students, we will have lost something very special in this country, we will have lost a part of the American Dream. Let's show them today that we understand that as well, and that we are doing something about it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my next speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to point out that during last year's debate on budget reconciliation, the contrast in approaches could not be sharper. In that bill, in a time of war, the Republican leadership passed an enormous tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. Most of it was paid for by running up a deficit for our grandchildren to pay, but a small slice of it was paid for by cutting $12 billion in Federal student loan support. I think it is clear that the American people rejected that kind of short-sightedness this past November. 
   Today, Democrats are cutting student loan rates in half, without adding one cent to the deficit. That is common sense for students, and a responsible policy for this country's working class. 
   Now I would like to yield 3 minutes to the new Member, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton).

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the next speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to point out to you that we are doing this because the American people have spoken. They spoke in November. They want us to make progress; and that every single reform in the Democrats' 100-hours agenda has passed with broad bipartisan support thus far. And today, we are cutting student loan rates in half in the same manner they garnered broad bipartisan support last week. 
   I think that all Members realize that the American people want results. House Democrats plan on delivering for them, and we continue to work with  those on the other side of the aisle to do that. You have not heard the last of us from this side at all. This is only the beginning. This is a step forward. 
   Now, at this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to a new Member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   First, I wish to thank all the Members who participated in this discussion on the importance of increasing opportunity and affordability for all of our Nation's young minds. We are all in agreement on the importance of education and the central role it played in expanding the next generation's horizons. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I described in my opening remarks, the resolution before the House allows for a vote on a Democratic proposal to cut subsidized student loan rates in half over the next 5 years. It will reduce the cost of college to some 5 million students by an average of $4,400. This is good, responsible progress for America's middle class, for our working families looking out to provide the next generation with a brighter future. Today's vote on the issue can make it a reality. 
   Last week, as part of Speaker Pelosi's 100-hour agenda, Democrats acted swiftly to help average Americans. We voted to increase the minimum wage, expand Federal stem cell research, negotiate lower drug prices for our seniors, and implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   All of these issues passed by wide bipartisan margins and enjoyed significant bipartisan support. 
   I expect that today's bill will be no different, so let's get to it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I want to thank the gentleman from California for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Bill. I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for the way they worked together to craft the balanced bill before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about the men and women who serve and defend our country. One of these heroes lives in my home town of Sacramento, Sergeant Jeremiah Anderson. Sergeant Anderson is a decorated soldier who served as an armored crewman for more than 4 years. He is an American hero. 
   But a provision in current law has kept him from receiving the full scope of Army College Fund benefits he earned and deserves. At least 40 other veterans around the country have had the same thing happen to them. The military's educational benefits are a crucial part of the promise we make to our soldiers. We vow to repay their service by providing them with opportunities to further their education. These education benefits help our soldiers reintegrate into their communities when they return from overseas, and in return, our communities benefit from their invaluable contributions, both in the military and here at home. 
   We must deliver on what we promise, Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the defense authorization bill for the good of our military families  and for the safety of our Nation in the future.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's debate is not about political calculation. It is not about public appearance or ready-made slogans. It is not about approval ratings or polls. 
   Today's debate is about the very future of this country that each one of us loves so dearly. It is a fork in the road. It is a rare opportunity for each of us to chart the course of the Nation we serve by casting a single vote. 
   Today we can vote for the status quo in Iraq or we can vote for change. For me, this choice is simple. I will vote for change. 
   The war in Iraq has divided our country for nearly 5 years, longer than our participation in World War II. Its monetary cost has already reached dizzying heights. Measured in casualties lost, lives forever altered, the toll of this war is truly staggering. 
   That is why we must transcend politics and party loyalty when we vote today. An issue of this magnitude requires each one of us as Members of Congress to vote based on our conscience and obligation to represent our constituents. 
   Mr. Speaker, on this issue my conscience and my constituents speak loud and clear. They say, We must end this war. Bring our troops home and work to restore our international reputation. 
   I stand here today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation because it accomplishes each of these three goals: 
   Within 30 days of enactment, it requires an immediate and orderly redeployment of our military from Iraq. No more delays, Mr. Speaker. 
   With today's bill, Congress stands with the American people in demanding a swift and responsible conclusion to military engagement in Iraq. 
   I also support this legislation because of what it does in the long term. It recognizes that we have a moral and strategic obligation to help rebuild Iraq, to avoid leaving a country in shambles. 
   The legislation before us today requires a comprehensive, diplomatic, political, and economic strategy for Iraq. We must work with our international partners to bring stability to Iraq, and this legislation does so. A renewed commitment to diplomacy is not only the right thing to do to fulfill our commitment to the Iraqi people, it also begins restoring our Nation's standing in the world. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the American people by voting for the bill before us today. This legislation takes a strong step forward in ending this long and costly war. In doing so, it is worthy of this House, worthy of the constituents we all serve, and worthy of the sacrifices of our soldiers and their families.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 Conference Report. 
   In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson laid out his domestic agenda, one that made Americans reevaluate what it means to be a Great Society. We learned much from that time in our Nation's rich history: that we must all fight together for civil rights, for equality, for peace and security, against poverty, and for future generations. 
   One year later, the Head Start program began as a product of Lyndon Johnson's vision of a Great Society. Now, over 40 years later, Head Start is truly one of our Nation's most successful programs. 
   Head Start takes a holistic approach to ensuring that our country's most at-risk children are educated and healthy. Kids who are vibrant and in school are put on a path to success. The program provides grants to local public and private agencies to offer comprehensive child development services to disadvantaged children and families. 
   I want to thank Chairman MILLER and Chairman KILDEE and all of the conferees for their important work on this conference agreement. 
   I am glad to see that this agreement authorizes 7.35 billion dollars for the program. Unfortunately, a number of residents in my hometown of Sacramento are eligible for enrollment in Head Start, but are currently on a waiting list because the program does not have enough funds. This funding authorization will help correct this urgent problem. It will help put Head Start back on track to ensuring that all eligible children will be able to participate in the program. 
   Also important is the expansion of the Early Head Start program. This program serves low-income youth from birth to age 3. It puts special focus on helping preschoolers develop the early reading and math skills they need to be successful in school. It recognizes that starting our children's education early is crucial to their long-term achievement. 
   The Conference Report also includes an increase in income eligibility. This is especially important in California due to my State's high cost-of-living. I want to thank the conferees for recognizing the growing needs in communities across the Nation by increasing income eligibility. 
   Study after study confirms that early education is the key to success later in life. And I am glad that Leadership has made educating our children a priority. With passage of this bill today, the 110th Congress indeed becomes the Children's Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, no child should be without early education. The Head Start program provides access to education for all of our children, regardless of their parents' economic status. 
   As Lyndon Johnson said, ``The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people. Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation.'' 
   I believe that reauthorizing the Head Start program reaffirms our commitment to the Great Society that Lyndon Johnson envisioned. I am proud to support the rule and the Head Start Improvement Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me time and her leadership on the committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress is on the cusp of an historic step, a first step to changing Iraq policy, enacting a fixed timetable to bring our troops home. The bill made in order under this rule is not perfect, but it deserves our strong support because it offers us our best chance at forcing a change of direction in Iraq after 4 long years of mismanagement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I opposed this war from the beginning, and I believe we must bring our troops home soon and in a responsible way. The President's reckless insistence on sticking to a failed policy in Iraq underlines the need for Congress to show leadership. This legislation gives us the chance for the first time to take a concrete step towards bringing the war to a close. 
   This bill does not go as far as I would like. I support a more rapid redeployment of our troops from Iraq. I also strongly believe the President should not be allowed to waive the legislation's troop readiness requirements. But it has become clear in recent weeks that this is the most aggressive approach that can obtain the necessary votes to pass this House. That is the reality here. This is, after all, the legislative branch. That means we can't change the policy if we can't pass the bill. 
   Enacting a fixed timetable to bring our troops home is a very significant leap forward in our Iraq policy. It provides a foundation for further action and increases pressure on the President. That is why the President opposes it so strongly. Defeating this bill would ultimately play into the President's hands, resulting in the eventual passage of a blank-check bill that places fewer restraints on the President. 
   Ultimately Congress faces a choice: Do we set a timetable to bring the troops home while providing for the troops in harm's way, or do we give the administration a blank check for a war without end? 
   I choose to begin steps to end the war. For that reason I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from New York, the distinguished chairman of our committee, Ms. SLAUGHTER for the time and for her leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the next twenty-four hours, this Congress will undertake a historic first step to changing our Iraq policy. 
   The bill made in order under this rule is not a perfect bill. But it deserves our strong support because it will bring a critical change of direction in Iraq after four long years of mismanagement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I opposed this war from the beginning. And I believe we must bring our troops home soon and in a responsible way. Our men and women in uniform have done everything we have asked of them. 
   They have endured multiple deployments and extended separation from their loved ones. They have followed orders into combat often without the proper body armor or equipment. 
   These are signs of an inexcusable lack of leadership from the President. Rather than change direction, the President has chosen to send tens of thousands of additional troops to Iraq. 
   This goes against the advice of his generals ..... against the advice of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group ..... and against the expressed wishes of the voters. 
   The President's reckless insistence on sticking to a failed policy in Iraq underlines the need for Congress to show leadership. 
   I support Congress taking firm steps to change our Nation's direction in Iraq. And I have cosponsored legislation to establish a timetable for redeployment of our troops. 
   As I said at the beginning, Congress has a historic opportunity to demonstrate its responsible leadership with this bill. And that's the prism through which I evaluate my vote this week. 
   The decision comes down to this--do we want to enact a bill that has flaws but does contain a fixed timetable to bring our troops home? Or do we want to vote down the fixed timetable and endorse President Bush's ability to continue to wage this war without any limits? 
   This bill does not go as far as I would like. I support a more rapid redeployment of our troops from Iraq. I also strongly believe the President should not be allowed to waive the legislation's troop readiness requirements. 
   Because of his gross mismanagement of the conflict, I believe the President has abdicated any right to deference on that front. 
   Having said that, it has become clear in recent weeks that this is the most aggressive approach that can obtain the necessary votes to pass the House of Representatives. 
   That is disappointing to me, but that is the reality here. This is, after all, the legislative branch. That means we can't change the policy if we can't pass the bill. 
   Enacting a fixed timetable to bring our troops home is a very significant leap forward in our Iraq policy. It provides a foundation for further action and increases pressure on the President. That is why the President opposes it so strongly. 
   To defeat this bill would result in the eventual passage of a blank check bill that places even fewer responsibilities on the President. 
   I believe it is simply unacceptable to give the President permission to mismanage the war as he chooses. 
   Ultimately, Congress faces a choice: Do we set a timetable to bring the troops home while providing for our troops in the field at every moment? 
   Or do we give the Administration a blank check for a war without end? I believe Congress must choose the former. 
   This legislation, whatever its flaws may be, enacts a timetable to bring our troops home while giving them the resources they need for protection while they are still in harm's way. For that reason, I am voting yes on the supplemental appropriations bill. 
   I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, the debate over our Nation's energy policy is both a national and a local one. Energy policy impacts our national security, our international trade balance, and our relations with other countries. 
   At the same time, energy policy reaches into every single State, county, and Congressional district. 
   The energy bill we consider today recognizes this fact. It makes significant investments in the new energy sources, research, and technology that will power our economy in the future. It revolutionizes our energy policy at the national and local levels. And it improves the way local communities around the country use, generate, and conserve power. 
   In my hometown of Sacramento, energy is an especially important local issue. Sacramento is located at the confluence of two mighty rivers, and at the base of a large watershed. This leaves us vulnerable to catastrophic floods that are made more likely because of global warming. The more we burn fossil fuels for energy, the higher our flood risk. 
   In Sacramento, changing our national energy policy means reducing our dependence on foreign oil, preserving our environment, and stopping global warming. It also means protecting our homes. 
   Mr. Chairman, the people of Sacramento are eager to change their energy consumption habits. In fact, we have already made significant investments in a new energy economy. 
   Sacramento has a growing clean-energy industry that is poised to take off. Our local utility produces significant electricity from solar, wind, and methane gas sources. Every day, more and more of the Sacramento region's homes, businesses, and vehicles are powered by renewable energy. 
   But my constituents need help from the Federal Government. That is why I am so proud to stand before the House today in support of this energy package. The investments it makes in clean energy complement and support what is already happening in Sacramento. 
   The bill's tax incentives for renewable energy bonds are crucial for my local electric utility. The biofuels that will be developed because of this legislation will power my constituents' cars. The people I represent will work in some of the 3 million new green-collar jobs it creates. My constituents will find it easier to take public transit because of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's title. 
   This energy bill helps Sacramento continue to lead our country's energy revolution, Mr. Chairman. Our Nation and our energy supply will be more secure once we pass it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this landmark legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5492, which is a bill to authorize appropriations for the Smithsonian for constructing of replacement greenhouses. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Smithsonian is widely renowned as a national treasure. Many of our constituents come from all over the country to visit its museums. There they can explore our culture, learn about our achievements, and view pieces of our history. 
   But the Smithsonian is much more than a keeper of artifacts. It has nine research facilities and is a leader in scientific research. The Horticulture Services Division provides a wide variety of services internally to Smithsonian museums, and more generally to the public through the Smithsonian's public gardens. 
   The Smithsonian has leased a 55,000-square-foot greenhouse complex for its horticultural operations since 1974. It is currently located on the property of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Northwest Washington, DC. 
   The complex includes 12 greenhouses, an office for administrative and logistical functions, and a shade house. These greenhouses produce the institution's world-class orchid collection. They also provide space to grow a wide variety of plant materials for exhibits, gardens, and special events which would be costly or impossible to obtain commercially. 
   The greenhouses allow the Smithsonian resources equal to, if not surpassing, any other botanical institute in the world. 
   The greenhouse employees do this work with limited human resources. As true to most Smithsonian endeavors, the greenhouse staff is assisted in large part by a group of dedicated volunteer staff members. During fiscal year 2007, over 4,500 hours of time were donated by these individuals. Their commitment to the greenhouse facilities' programs is evident from their dedication, some of whom have donated over 25 years of service to the organization. 
   The current greenhouse site will be leased commercially, and the Smithsonian must begin work on replacement greenhouses at the Smithsonian Museum Support Facility in Suitland, Maryland. Moving the facilities is the most cost-effective way to preserve the greenhouses. The Smithsonian has also created a design that will help save money during construction. 
   Mr. Speaker, the important work being done every day by the Smithsonian horticulturists in the current facility is vital to the mission of the Smithsonian, the increase and diffusion of knowledge. 
   I appreciate Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman NORTON, and Ranking Members MICA and GRAVES for recognizing the significance of this relocation. H.R. 5492 will ensure that the collections thrive and the important work that is done at these facilities continues. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 and to encourage all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto for this long overdue legislation. 
   We have not had a WRDA bill in over 7 years. If Hurricane Katrina taught us anything, it is that investing in our infrastructure is a crucial component of preparing for emergencies. Seven years is perilously close to an entire generation without a national overarching water policy. 
   In my hometown of Sacramento, we are all too aware of the importance of investing in water projects. We live at the confluence of two great rivers: the American and Sacramento. 
   Sacramento is the most at-risk river city in the Nation, and we know that we must be vigilant in our efforts to increase our flood protection. This bill marks a significant step in our efforts to increasing the security of our Nation for generations to come. To be clear, Mr. Speaker, we need this bill in Sacramento and the Nation needs this bill. 
   After years of inaction, the bipartisan WRDA bill we have passed comes not a moment too soon. There should be a WRDA bill coming out of Congress and signed by the President every 2 years. Unfortunately, the President has turned his back on assuring the safety and security of the American people. This strong, bipartisan legislation will take significant steps to improve our flood protection and invest in the future health of our communities. 
   In Sacramento we know exactly how important this bill is to our safety, and I look forward to voting to override the President's veto today. 
   I want to commend Chairman JIM OBERSTAR, Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairwoman Johnson, and Ranking Member Baker for their strong bipartisan leadership in making WRDA 2007 a reality.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, the bill under consideration today represents the core of what the American people send us here to do. It invests in children's health and encourages our young people to serve their communities. It helps people train for the workplace and provides funding for crucial education programs. It represents the best of what government by the people can do. 
   That is why I am pleased to support the rule and the underlying legislation, Madam Speaker. I am particularly encouraged by the investments it makes in children's health and in national service. 
   Today's appropriations package fully funds the National Children's Study. This Study is a perfect example of the kinds of long-term health initiatives that the government is perfectly positioned to lead. 
   It will examine 100,000 children from before birth to age 21. The data generated by the Children's Study will help us develop cures for diseases like autism, asthma, childhood obesity, and diabetes. 
   The Children's Study is the first of its kind, Madam Speaker. But we do not have to wait decades for the Study to change lives. In just a few short years, it will begin generating useful data on premature birth, common birth defects, and prenatal links to autism. 
   I am pleased that today's appropriations package invests so wisely in the National Children's Study, and I urge all my colleagues to support it as a result. 
   Madam Speaker, the conferees also recognized the importance of our National Service Programs. Over the last few years, service members have provided humanitarian and educational assistance to the victims of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. More recently, they have offered their services to help calm the wildfires that have devastated my home State of California. 
   I am pleased that the conferees appropriated high funding levels to help sustain and grow our service programs. National Civilian Community Corps received over $24 million in funding. Currently, there are only three of these campuses in our Nation, and I am glad that this funding will help build two new campuses. 
   I am also pleased to see that the other important programs--like Learn and Serve America, Volunteers in Service to America and AmeriCorps State and National programs--all received high levels of funding. These National Service Programs are essential to the health of our communities and Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, today's legislation is about making our priorities clear. Protecting children's health and encouraging national service are not choices we have as Members of Congress. They are responsibilities. I am pleased that today's legislation fulfills our collective responsibilities as representatives of the people. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my colleague and dear friend Representative MIKE MCNULTY on his upcoming retirement, and compliment his two decades of honorable service in the House, and nearly 40 years serving in elected office. His absence from the House will be felt, and I wish him happiness and success for the future and the successes it is sure to bring. 
   For 20 years Congressman MCNULTY has served his New York district with integrity and the utmost concern for his constituents and their communities. In his nearly 40 years serving those communities, MICHAEL has always advocated for intelligent and just solutions to the issues that touch his constituent's lives. As a mayor and New York State Legislator, Congressman MCNULTY advocated for improvements in substance-abuse education and prevention and fought for his communities' infrastructure and economic improvements. As a member of the House he has continued this advocacy on not only local issues, but humanitarian as well. He has been a leader on issues of human rights, hunger, poverty, and international affairs. In 2006, MIKE was re-elected with nearly 78 percent of the vote, a well-deserved affirmation by his constituents of a job and career well done. 
   Congressman MCNULTY is a fairminded and level-headed individual who brought a wealth of experience and insight to his seat as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security. His character is one of deliberate and thoughtful decision making, based on insight and a true understanding of his district and our country. He is an ever dependable friend and a colleague I greatly respect. 
   I had the opportunity to serve last year with MIKE as a Helsinki Commissioner, and visited Kyiv, working to further address continued humanitarian issues there. His work, our discussions and the successes we walked away with were exemplary of his high level of understanding and his personal attention to the challenges that the people of the region continue to face.  
   While I know that Congressman MCNULTY will be greatly missed by his colleagues here, I also know that his character and passion for a better world will only lend itself to continued service and continued good work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in congratulating Congressman MCNULTY, and wishing him our best for his future.

    Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, liberty and security are not mutually exclusive. Quite the opposite; they go hand in hand. 
    The FISA Amendments Act recognizes this reality. This legislation is a balanced compromise that protects our country and ensures that our basic American freedoms remain intact. 
    Our great country is founded on civil liberties, and secured by our intelligence community. 
    Much of what keeps us safe is our commitment to upholding the values of freedom and liberty. 
    All the security in the world is meaningless if we fail to protect the values that make our country worth defending in the first place. 
    If we surrender the basic principles that make us who we are, we will forever change what it means to be American. 
    Mr. Speaker, I know what can happen when we abandon our core American values. I was born in an internment camp, and my own family suffered the consequences when our country succumbed to the rhetoric of fear. 
    That was a dark time in our Nation's history--one we cannot afford to repeat. 
    That is why the legislation before us today is so important. 
    It protects the liberties that we cherish, liberties that are the birthright of every American citizen. 
    At the same time, it recognizes the need for the surveillance of our enemies. 
    It gives our intelligence agencies the tools necessary to keep us safe, and provides strong legal clarity for the intelligence community. 
    The compromise solution we have negotiated also allows telecommunications companies to defend themselves in a court of law. 
    It takes Congress out of the equation and puts legal decisions back where they belong: in the court system. 
    I am confident that this process will result in a fair solution to the civil cases that have been brought against these companies. 
    That is why this balanced legislation deserves the support of every Member of this House. 
    This bill will keep us safe, and it will keep us free. 
    I urge passage of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008,

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 597 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration and considers the conference report as read. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been well-documented that our country has not had a WRDA bill in over 7 years. Seven years is perilously close to an entire generation passing without a national water resources policy being signed into law by the President. We are taking a big step in that direction today. 
   WRDA authorizes upwards of $20 billion for the construction of water resource development projects and studies by the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, navigation, and environmental restoration. Additionally, H.R. 1495 authorizes hurricane recovery activities along the gulf coast that would cost an estimated $2 billion. Furthermore, the bill requires an external peer review for studies and projects that would cost more than $45 million. The bill also coordinates environmental analyses and other permit processes among Federal and State agencies and authorizes environmental quality initiatives. 
   In my district in Sacramento, California, this WRDA bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass Congress this year. We have been waiting a long time for this bill. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city for catastrophic flooding. Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers, the Sacramento floodplain contains: 165,000 homes; over 488,000 residents; 1,300 government facilities, including the State capitol; and businesses providing 200,000 jobs. It is a hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people. 
   A major flood along the American River or the Sacramento River would have catastrophic ripple effects regionally and nationally; cost upwards of $35 billion in direct property damages; and likely would result in significant loss of life to our families, friends, and neighbors. In my district we understand the need and urgency for an overarching water resources policy to protect our homes, businesses, and families. Sacramento needs this bill, but so  do countless other communities across the Nation. 
   This bill, the projects and policy it contains, goes a long way in addressing our country's flood vulnerabilities. Nationally, regions across the country are starving for a Federal partner in water resources policy. Our country is confronted with population growth, climate change, and growing demands on our water infrastructure. Our districts across the country need this bill, and the Members in this Chamber have repeatedly supported WRDA bills. 
   In the 108th Congress, WRDA passed the House by a vote of 412-8. In the 109th Congress, WRDA passed the House 406-14. In the 110th Congress, WRDA passed the House 394-25. 
   There is a strong history of support and bipartisanship for WRDA bills. It is my hope that this support continues and that we move forward on this very important work. 
   I also want to congratulate and thank Water Resources Environment Subcommittee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and full committee Chairman Jim Oberstar for their commitment to make this bill a priority in the 110th Congress. 
   Finally, I want to make a point that WRDA bills are traditionally intended to be 2-year authorization bills. It is important that we get our water policy back on track and address these ongoing challenges on a regular basis. It is my belief that the best protection that we can provide our communities is to be prepared. I look forward to passing this WRDA conference report and moving on to the next WRDA bill. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as was said, this bill is long overdue. Our country needs a comprehensive water resources policy, and WRDA is the framework that can meet this need. 
   We have 7 years of backlogged water projects that must be addressed. There is a growing demand on our already overburdened water infrastructure. The sooner we move forward on this conference report, the sooner our communities across the country will be healthier and safer. This conference report has bipartisan support. In fact, every member of the conference signed off on it.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. This important legislation will be considered under an open rule with a preprinting requirement, allowing any Member to submit changes or improvements to the bill. 
   Chairman Gordon, Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Hall, Ranking Member Ehlers, and the Science and Technology Committee have put together an excellent product, and I look forward to an open and constructive debate. 
   I am proud that today's debate will shine a light on the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation is truly one of the Federal Government's greatest accomplishments. It features a rich tradition that has supported talented young investigators, made America the world leader in basic science and innovation, and laid the groundwork for the Nation's economic strength. 
   This reauthorization also represents another important step in the implementation of the innovation agenda. By boosting scientific research and development, moving the Nation toward a clean energy economy, promoting broadband deployment, and supporting small business entrepreneurs, the innovation agenda will keep our promise to maintain and strengthen America's competitiveness and leadership in the global economy. 
   At present the National Science Foundation supports research and education activities at over 2,000 universities colleges, K-12 schools, and research institutions throughout the country. It is unique among our Federal research enterprises in that NSF supports scientists and engineers across all disciplines. 
   In a given year, NSF will support about 200,000 scientists, engineers, teachers, and students. That is why NSF has led to groundbreaking research in such varied fields as genetics, computer science, information technology, nanotechnology, and climate change. 
   By way of example, in my district, NSF funds the UC Davis Center for Biophotonics Science & Technology. The center features dynamic and innovative research that harnesses light to facilitate revolutionary advances in biomedical science. The potential applications for medical research and treatment are groundbreaking and will offer hope to thousands of our constituents. That is the kind of research NSF supports. 
   I would also like to point out that NSF resources are distributed on a competitive peer review basis; so an objective process allows for only the most worthy proposal to receive funding. This is the best kind of investment the Federal Government can make because the return on this investment is tremendous. By stimulating innovative research, we create educational opportunities for promising students and drive cutting-edge research throughout the country. There is no better way to fuel the economy and create quality jobs. That is why the National Science Foundation has broad and bipartisan support in Congress. 
   This reauthorization provides $21 billion at NSF for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. In doing so, it keeps us on the path to double the National Science Foundation funding by 2017. This was a key recommendation of the highly respected National Academy's report on U.S. competitiveness, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' And this boost is urgently needed, since today NSF can only fund about a quarter of the grant proposals that are submitted. 
   The bill also creates a pilot program targeted at new investigators so we can bring more talented young people into scientific research fields, and it directs NSF to facilitate public-private partnerships, a proven method to leveraging Federal investment and bolstering American competitiveness. 
   Finally, this reauthorization bill is on the Agency's legacy of promoting math and science education by including the provisions of H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Math and Science Scholarship Act, which the House passed last week. 
   With that, I thank the Science Committee once again for this excellent legislation. I look forward to a robust debate on this bill, and I hope we can work with the Senate to get it on the President's desk in short order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I am very much looking forward to the upcoming debate on the National Science Foundation reauthorizing that this rule allows. In discussing the various programs and initiatives at NSF, we will demonstrate how the Federal Government can strategically and effectively drive scientific discovery and innovation. 
   The importance of the National Science Foundation and its mission must not be underestimated. While America has been blessed with abundant natural resources and defensible borders, it is the innovative spirit of our citizens that has driven this Nation's leadership in the global economy. 
   Throughout our history, we have been willing to experiment, to take risks, to constantly redefine what is possible. That tradition has given us a competitive advantage over other countries that has created prosperity for the Nation, improving the quality of life for all our constituents. 
   As Members know well, our leadership in the global economy is at risk today. While we face rising threats from countries like India and China, we have also failed to make the necessary investments in education, science, and research and development to maintain the foundation of knowledge that has served us so well in the past. 
   This NSF reauthorization takes great strides to remedy that neglect. Most importantly, by committing to double NSF funding over the next 10 years, we demonstrate that ensuring the Nation's competitiveness is of the highest priority. 
   As the House continues to consider items from the innovation agenda, the importance we place on competitiveness will be demonstrated again and again. 
   With that, I look forward to today's debate and continuing to move forward on measures like this one that will bolster innovation and competitiveness. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to the NSF reauthorization is designed to improve the ability of scientists to communicate with nonscientific audiences such as businesses, the media, the general public and, of course, Members of Congress. Specifically, my amendment would add a provision to H.R. 1667 that authorizes a science communications initiative at the National Science Foundation. 
   I believe this proposal will ensure that we are getting as much return on the Federal Government's investment in the National Science Foundation as possible. By implementing this program, it would diversify the education of our scientists and would ensure that policymakers and other nonscientists have better access to the technical expertise fostered by NSF and the Nation's broader research enterprise, because if scientists can't tell the rest of us what they have discovered, we are not fully recognizing the benefits of our investment in scientific research. Unfortunately, the ability to articulate the content and significance of scientific information is often overlooked by graduate training programs. 
   My amendment directly addresses this unmet need and would create a pipeline of scientists who are increasingly engaged with nonscientists, including policymakers, business leaders and others. Providing communications training to our scientists will ensure that we, the policymakers, can make the most informed decisions possible as we debate technical issues and craft policy. 
   This amendment creates a competitively reviewed supplement within the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, or IGERT program. Investigators at IGERT-awardee institutions will compete for resources to develop and implement communications training. The IGERT program will administer the competitive review process for this communications training initiative. 
   I have received strong support for this program from stakeholders in my district of Sacramento and from across the country. Policymakers, scientists, educators, business leaders and science writers all agree we need to better integrate scientific expertise into the public debate. 
   This amendment represents an important step toward that goal. That is  why this amendment has received the endorsement of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and The Council of Graduate Schools. 
   This amendment is based on the Scientific Communication Act of 2007, H.R. 1453, that I introduced with Chairman Gordon as an original cosponsor. I would like to thank Chairman Gordon, Mr. Hope, Mr. Allen, Mr. Inslee and Mr. Higgins for their cosponsorship of that legislation. 
   Before I close, I would like to address a few misconceptions about this amendment. I want to be clear, this amendment contains no new authorization levels. For those who said that this program would take away from other NSF grants, I want to make a few points. The NSF Director would determine the level of resources to devote to this program. If the NSF Director does not deem this program worthy of funding, it won't get any. 
   However, I think scientists, teachers, reporters, business owners, Members of Congress and all our constituents should support this program. This bill authorized $21 billion for the National Science Foundation. 
   What good is that level of investment if we don't maximize the benefits? You should not need a Ph.D. to utilize the ideas and breakthroughs that NSF-supported research produces. That's why I am proposing this amendment. It will help to bridge the communication gap between scientists and the rest of us. 
   I hope all my colleagues here in the House will support this amendment. As policymakers, I promise you, you will personally benefit from this program when you hear expert testimony on technical topics. But, more importantly, you should support it because it will enable all your constituents to share in the excellent research supported by NSF.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today joining my colleagues in tribute, sharing kind words and memories of our colleague and dear friend Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   I was deeply saddened when I heard the news of her death. My sincerest thoughts and prayers go out to her son Mervyn, to all her family, and to her friends and supporters during this difficult time. ' 
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones was an inspiration and a tireless advocate for her constituents. She was a fighter. A strong woman of conviction and intelligence, whose values and experience guided her advocacy and fearlessness. 
   Stephanie broke molds, she broke glass ceilings, and then swept away the stereotypes. Stephanie was never one to be absorbed into the folds of a monochrome following. She was outspoken and proactive, bold in demeanor and action. Her always bright and powerful attire spoke to her outgoing personality, which never shied away from a challenge and approached every day with enthusiasm and confidence. Her skill in crafting intelligent and responsible legislation shows that she viewed the world through this diverse spectrum of color, dismissing the notion that solutions to complex problems can come from a world of simply black and white. 
   Justice and inclusion were at the heart of her work. In her 10 years in Congress and her lifetime of service she always put justice, opportunity, and equality atop all other pursuits. Stephanie did not come from a life of privilege simply to serve the privileged. She came from a working class community and put her heart and soul into lifting up that community with every step of the ladder she climbed. 
   I remember how highly coveted she was by the then members of the Ways and Means committee, when joining the powerful committee soon after her election. My husband Bob served on the then committee and recognized in her character the genuine desire to serve her Nation, her constituents, and those whose voices had yet to be fully heard. Her experience as a prosecutor and judge gave her arguments tenacity and her decisions finality. 
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones effectively represented her Cleveland district for over a decade. Yet she never dismissed the acknowledgment that her success as a groundbreaking figure touched many outside her district's boundaries. Her work looked beyond district lines and party lines to affect, inspire, and speak for those in need of justice and advocacy. 
   My heart goes out to her loved ones. I know that she will be greatly missed by everyone who knew her. Her impact will continue to be felt, not only in her Cleveland district and the U.S. House of Representatives, but by the many individuals who benefited from her service.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding me time. 
   I rise today in strong support not only of this bill but also of increased accountability in Iraq. From the outset, this misguided war has been characterized by gray areas, gray areas of policy, of motivation and of legitimacy. One consequence of these gray areas has been the collapse of law and order in Iraq. Many military contractors, contractors paid by our government, contribute to the chaos there. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Iraq war is a first major conflict in which private contractors perform tasks typically done by uniformed military. Employees from companies like Blackwater provide security for military and political figures. They protect buildings. Rumors have swirled that they may soon guard military convoys. 
   Mr. Speaker, private contractors acting in military roles should be held to the same standards as our armed services. They should not have free rein to shoot, maim and kill people in the name of security. If they act illegally, they must be punished accordingly. This, Mr. Speaker, is what law and order means. We cannot convince the world that we value peace and security if American contractors are undermining it in Iraq. It is hypocritical for us to ask Iraqis to obey the rule of law when we do not demand the same from the contractors we are paying. Like all of my colleagues, I want our brave young men and women in Iraq to be as safe as they can be. The legislation before us today will help restore the trust of the Iraqi public and of the international community. 
   During World War II, only 5 percent of our in-theater forces were private contractors. Today, we have just as many contractors in Iraq as we do American soldiers, contractors who are not accountable to the American people but who are paid for by the American people. Crimes committed by these contractors are the reason why this bill is so long overdue. It finally holds contractors accountable for their actions. But the larger issue is that our men and women in uniform are overburdened. Our military is in danger of collapsing under the strain of a never-ending war. This is one of the many reasons why we must change course in Iraq. 
   That, Mr. Speaker, is my objective. It is the objective of a clear majority in the House. It is the will of the American people. We must do everything we  can to increase oversight of contractors. This legislation is a step in the right direction. 
   I urge my colleagues to take this step today so that in the coming days, we can finally change our Nation's course in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida, my good friend, Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 214 provides for consideration of H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007, under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure amendment in the nature of a substitute now printed in the bill as an original bill for the purpose of amendment, which shall be considered as read. The rule provides that any amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute must be printed in the Congressional Record prior to consideration of the bill. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I just stated, House Resolution 214 is an open rule. This is the third open rule recommended by the Rules Committee during the 110th Congress. The committee's fourth open rule will be considered on the floor tomorrow. 
   The Democratic majority is backing up its commitment to greater openness with real action. The Rules Committee's two prior open rules permitted Members to offer 19 amendments on the floor. The House adopted the overwhelming majority of them. It goes to show the Members often can improve legislation when given the opportunity; and I am sure that we will have a good debate today, also. 
   The underlying legislation made in order under this rule represents a long-overdue, necessary investment in our Nation's clean water infrastructure. The Water Quality Investment Act provides sorely needed funding for cities and States to upgrade combined sewer systems. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all take our sewer systems for granted. Most of our country's wastewater infrastructure is out of sight and, for the majority of our constituents, it is out of mind as well. But once these sewers back up and overflow into our streets and rivers, sewers become an urgent issue. 
   Combined sewers are an older technology. They were built back when it made sense to collect wastewater and storm runoff in the same pipes. They do not have the same capacity of more modern infrastructure. During heavy storms, they often back up and overflow. When this happens, untreated wastewater stagnates in our streets and pollutes our rivers. Raw sewage seeps into basements, public parks and other areas where young children play. Public health is severely impacted. 
   The long-term investment fallout can be even worse. My hometown of Sacramento struggles with the problems posed by combined sewers. During the heavy winter storms which periodically sweep through California, these sewers in our central city can overflow. When this happens, over 500,000 gallons of wastewater flow into our public waterways and neighborhoods. 
   My constituents already face dangers of flooding from the two large rivers which ring our city. They should not have to worry about additional flooding from our underground sewers. 
   This problem is not unique to Sacramento. Over 700 cities across the country have combined sewer systems. These cities need help from the Federal Government to undertake the costly task of upgrading their infrastructure. A vote for this bill before us today is an investment in the health of these cities and towns all throughout our country. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for the focus he has shown in shepherding this bill through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. This bill became trapped in committee under the previous majority. I think we are all happy to see it finally make it to the floor under the new majority. 
   We all have a stake in keeping our infrastructure up to date and protecting our constituents' health. Upgrading combined sewers today will do both of these things. I urge all Members to pass this fair and open rule and to support the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, wastewater infrastructure may not be the most glamorous of issues. Nonetheless, it is an important one for the health of our environment and our constituents. 
   No American should have to walk outside after a storm to see sewage in the streets. None of our constituents should have to fear that swimming or boating in rivers will expose them to industrial waste. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that our country's combined sewers are not up to the task of cleaning our waters. 
   The good news is that the underlying bill made in order under this open rule will help our local municipalities fix this problem. It is an opportunity to invest in our national infrastructure, protect our environment, and secure our public health. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This point of order is about whether or not to consider this rule and ultimately the underlying bill. In fact, I would say that it is simply an effort to try to kill this bill before we even have an opportunity to debate it. I hope my colleagues will vote ``yes'' on this procedural motion so we can consider this important legislation today. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5351 is about investing in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is about boosting our economy and national security while protecting our environment. 
   It is abundantly clear that our dependence on foreign oil has skyrocketed with much of it imported from the volatile Middle East with a price tag today of $102 a barrel. It's time to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, not only to strengthen our national security but to support domestic production of renewable energy. We need to take action now and start by considering and passing the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax bill today. 
   This bill is about the hardworking American families. It is about creating jobs for the American worker and about protecting their rights. If we are creating jobs in this bill, which we are, we should be making sure that workers are making prevailing wages. 
   The Davis-Bacon Act requires contractors to pay no less than the locally prevailing wage on Federal contract construction. Davis-Bacon was adopted in 1931, during the Hoover administration, to protect the rights of the American workforce. During the more than 70 years since its enactment, Davis-Bacon has come under fire many times but has always received support from the Congress and American families who benefit from it. 
   The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act addresses the priorities of the American people. In addition to tackling our energy crisis, H.R. 5351 complies with PAYGO rules, which is a priority of the 110th Congress. The bill is therefore paid for. Most of the funding is by reducing tax cuts to the top-earning oil companies. In order to pay for the important tax extensions and comply with PAYGO, there had to be revenue raisers. Our country is facing record deficits, and this Congress is acting responsibly. 
   This bill will develop a progressive energy policy that is long term, not shortsighted. It does away with the tired strategies of the past, which focused only on producing more oil at the expense of the environment and of the American taxpayer. We are heeding the calls of the American people by adopting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell).

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1001 provides for consideration of H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides 90 minutes of debate on the bill, equally divided and controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the Congressional Record if offered by Representative McCrery or his designee. The substitute amendment is debatable for 1 hour. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit the bill, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's debate is quite simple: It is about taking action on an important priority of the American people. It is about investing in renewable energy, which will chart a new direction for our country's energy policy. This bill will ensure that hardworking Americans can buy affordable energy that is environmentally sound. It restores balance to our energy policy after years of favoring Big Oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, hardworking American families are struggling to pay their bills in an uncertain economy. They face the growing cost of basic necessities, such as gasoline and heating oil. This is a direct result of rising oil prices. 
   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to protect our constituents from big oil companies and countries that are taking advantage of working families. The Renewable Energy and Energy Tax Conservation Act restores balance to our energy policy. For years, we have had a tax structure that favors huge oil companies over the American family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the facts speak for themselves. Oil costs today rose to $102 a barrel for the first time in history. It is more expensive for Americans to drive their kids to school, to go to the grocery store, to heat their homes, and to vacation with their families. Americans are paying more than ever to fill up their cars, and big oil companies are reaping the profits. 
   In my home State of California, the price of gasoline is more than double what it was when this administration came into office. Last year, ExxonMobil posted the largest profit in American history, nearly $40 billion to one company. This equation is simple: Americans pay more; oil companies make more. This is unacceptable for the families we represent. 
   Unfortunately, it is perfectly acceptable for our President. This is a President who said that we don't need incentives for oil and gas companies to explore. That was back when the price of oil was $55 per barrel. It is now almost double that. It is obvious that any system that rewards the top earning oil companies and neglects our constituents and the environment ignores the priorities of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's legislation will correct this inequity. It will transfer some of the massive profits enjoyed by these oil companies and invest them in renewable resources that will power our economy in the future. 
   Our scientists have been hard at work researching ways to harness the powerful assets of our planet. We can have a healthy economy even as we preserve our natural resources and our skies. Solar, wind, and geothermal technologies are ready for the mainstream. Our legislation will help get them there. 
   In the case of solar, we are not just creating new incentives. We are extending successful tax breaks that have helped these industries get off the ground. Our legislation will allow public agencies to issue bonds to pay for clean energy projects. Some of the most effective public energy agencies in the country have put this provision at the top of their priority list. 
   This bill envisions a future where our country is no longer beholden to the oil market. It will dramatically pump up our domestic production of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel and cellulosic alcohol. The bill also contains a tax break to increase the number of alternative refueling stations so that Americans have options to fill up on the next generation of fuels.     
   This legislation recognizes that we can and must create the technologies today that we will use in the future. It harnesses our inventive American spirit to tackle our energy problems. It creates a sliding-scale tax incentive for consumers to purchase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. It encourages investment in solar fuel cells and harnesses the power of cutting-edge technologies that produce energy from landfill gas and marine sources. 
   It builds on the desire of the American people for a more balanced and progressive energy policy. Making our homes and buildings more energy efficient is one of the most cost-effective ways to save money and power. 
   Our legislation contains significant incentives for efficiency programs. These changes will save money for constituents in the short and long run. They will also help preserve jobs. If tax incentives for wind and solar production are not extended, 116,000 American jobs will be lost. The legislation before us is critical to the health of our economy. 
   Most important, though, is that this legislation builds on the desire of the American people for a more balanced and progressive energy policy. The American people want us to take action to modernize our energy supply, and that is what we are doing. This bill will also help to lessen our dangerous dependence on oil from unstable parts of the world. 
   Earlier this month, our energy markets were disturbed by rumors that Venezuela was cutting off oil shipments. Events like these are a stark reminder that even though we are the strongest country in the world, we are also very vulnerable. 
   The short-sighted energy policy of the past is undermining our national security. We will only get weaker unless we change course now and invest in renewable fuels that are produced here at home, not in countries that wish us harm. 
   This House has heard the message that the American people have been sending us for a long time. We must overhaul our energy policy, and this bill is the second step toward this goal. We took the first step late last year when Democrats reached across the aisle. We worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the first increase in fuel economy standards in decades. 
   We could have done even more to restore balance to our energy policy.  Many of the provisions in today's bill were a part of last year's energy legislation passed by this House. But we were stymied by Republican obstructionism in the Senate. 
   I am one of the millions of Americans who want to see us do even more. People like Luquita Hutchinson from my hometown of Sacramento. She and her family are the reasons we must chart a new course forward here today. 
   Because of trying to balance her household budget, Luquita has stopped buying meat at the grocery store because she has to pay so much for gas at the pump. Today, in Sacramento, it's $3.35 a gallon. She has to make a choice between buying food for her family or filling up her gas tank. 
   It is for the sake of people like Luquita that I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation on the floor today. This bill makes us safer by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It protects the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans like Luquita Hutchinson, and it transforms our energy policy to maximize the benefits of clean, affordable, and renewable energy. If we pass today's bill, this kind of clean energy future is within our grasp. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the next speaker, I would just like to say, unfortunately, it is ironic that the minority is coming to the floor with this issue yet again, especially since the minority has refused to come to the table as we are trying to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions. Yes, we have been trying to move forward with the negotiations, but the minority has not been willing to participate. 
   I would also like to remind my colleagues that one of the most destabilizing forces in the world is the competition for declining oil resources in the world.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, today's debate is really about the future of our country. Those of us who think that American leadership can create new sources of clean energy will vote for this bill. Those of us who think that high oil prices, economic uncertainty, and dependence on foreign oil are good energy policy will vote against it. 
   I know where my loyalties lie in this debate. They lie with Americans who are struggling to find the money to drive their children to school. They lie with people in my State of California who are concerned about global warming. They lie with my constituents who want a new direction for energy policy. It is for them that I support this legislation today. It is for them that I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Voting for the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act is a way to show our constituents that the energy policies of the past are no longer acceptable. The American people are challenging us to create a new strategy focused on renewable and affordable energy. Those of us who support today's bill are meeting that challenge. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1389 provides for consideration of the conference report on H.R. 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The rule, which is a traditional conference report rule, waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration, and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   It should be noted that despite the blanket waiver, the conference report does not violate either clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The conference report fully complies with the earmark and PAYGO rules of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Chairman Miller on his dedication to bringing this bill before us. I also want to thank Ranking Member McKeon and the rest of the Education and Labor Committee for their work on this bill. I also want to acknowledge Senator Kennedy for his hard work and constant commitment to this important issue. 
   It has been 10 years since the Higher Education Act was authorized, and with this conference agreement Congress will continue the vision of Lyndon Johnson's great society where college is accessible and affordable to every American. 
   As our Nation continues to experience economic uncertainty, it is imperative that we make a college education more affordable. The unfortunate reality is that skyrocketing costs are putting a college education out of the reach for many middle-class families. 
   According to a recent College Board report, over the last 5 years tuition and fees at 4-year public institutions have increased 31 percent after inflation. At private universities, tuition has increased 17 percent. 
   In addition to rising tuition, students and their families face a cumbersome Federal student aid application process that is overly complex and difficult to manage. Mr. Speaker, the Higher Education Opportunity Act will resolve many of these issues, thereby continuing this Congress' efforts to make college more affordable and accessible. 
   Nearly one year ago, the President signed into law landmark changes to lender subsidies and student aid, followed shortly after by a law to ensure access to loans and increase loan limits. And now, we are reauthorizing legislation that will, for the first time in 10 years, reform our higher education system so that it operates in the best interest of students and families. 
   Specifically, the bill will require colleges to report reasons for any tuition hikes, and plans for lowering student costs. H.R. 4137 will reform and simplify the student loan system by requiring institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct, many of which were included in the Sunshine Act which passed the House last year. 
   In an effort to be consumer friendly and provide full disclosure of all options available for each student, the bill requires the Secretary to develop a Web-based calculator to allow families to compare the costs of different colleges. And it also requires lenders to provide students with complete disclosure of the borrowing options, giving them 30 days after the approval of loans to find better deals. 
   Equally important, the bill provides for an increase in Pell Grant funding from $5,800 to $8,000. This will give more of our youth the opportunity to attend a university. The bill will also expand college access and support for low-income and minority students by allowing students to receive Pell Grant scholarship aid year around. 
   H.R. 4137 will also expand college opportunities for disabled citizens by expanding eligibility for Pell Grant scholarships and establishing a national center to provide support services. 
   During times of war, it is extremely important to ensure that our military families and returning veterans have the support services they deserve. This bill will increase college aid and support for veterans and military families, create a new scholarship program for active duty military personnel and their family members, and ensure fairness in student and housing aid for veterans. 
   The bill also encourages students who graduate from college to enter into public service in high-need areas by granting loan forgiveness. It also provides up to $2,000 a year for 5 years for nurses, teachers, mental health professionals, and other low-paying but crucial professionals. I know this loan assistance and forgiveness will help my home of State of California that is suffering from a lack of nurses, teachers, and other vital support professionals who protect and assist our children and most reliant Americans. 
   Simply put, this conference report will not only advance the opportunity for every American to go to college, but will also put us on track toward creating a better America. 
   As Lyndon Johnson said, ``We must open the doors of opportunity, but we must also equip our people to walk through those doors.'' Our Constitution creates those doors of opportunity, and today this bill will equip our constituents to walk through those doors. 
   I want to thank once again Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for coming together on this important legislation. I stand strongly in support of the Higher Education Opportunity Act. This is long overdue, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Diaz-Balart, and I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I would like to say, first, that nearly 80 percent of offshore oil is in areas that are already open for exploration. In fact, 68 million acres, onshore and offshore, are already under lease by oil companies, but not being drilled. 
   Democrats have said ``use it or lose it'' to the oil companies: drill the oil or give up the lease to someone who will. And Democrats have called for mandatory leasing in the National Petroleum  Reserve in Alaska, which has more oil than the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. 
   Oil companies have billions of barrels of American oil available to them right now, and the President's own Department of Energy says the impact of any new drilling will be insignificant, promising only pennies per gallon a decade or two down the road. 
   Under Democratic leadership, the Congress has enacted into law the first new vehicle fuel efficiency standards in 32 years, saving up to $1,000 in gas per car per year; a historic commitment to American-grown biofuels, which are keeping gas prices 15 percent lower now than they would otherwise be as a result of blended fuels; action to impact record gas prices by suspending oil purchasing for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; recovery rebates that help Americans struggling with rising prices, including gas, with a check of $600 or more. And what we're doing today, making college more affordable, will help American working families. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today is a fair rule that allows us to highlight educational challenges and offers remedies for them in order to create a better tomorrow. 
   It is our responsibility to provide our constituents with greater access to a college education, especially at a time when the price of college is steadily increasing. 
   This bill will complete a year of important changes to higher education policy. Nearly 1 year ago, the Democratic Congress took the lead on landmark changes to lender subsidies and student aid, followed by a measure to ensure access to loans and increase loan limits. And now we will send the President yet another bill that makes college more affordable and address the student loan process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful today. Finally, 4 years into a very controversial war, Congress will begin to fulfill its constitutional responsibility as Representatives of the people. This week, every Member of the House of Representatives has had an opportunity to express their views on the war in Iraq. And today, every Member will cast their vote for or against the President's escalation of the war. This is only right. 
   For my part, I believe the President's proposed escalation would be a tragic mistake. Our need for a change of direction could not be more clear. But rather than change direction, the President proposes that we continue down our current disastrous path, only at a faster pace and with more human life placed in harm's way. 
   We should be bringing troops home, not sending more there. We should be ending this war, not escalating it. Considering this resolution is only the first step of many Congress will need to take to force a change in direction, but as Thomas Jefferson once said, honesty is the first chapter of the book of wisdom. Congress writes that chapter with this resolution, but it is only the first chapter. 
   Sadly, the burden created by the lack of honesty and wisdom this administration has brought to this conflict is shouldered by our brave men and women in uniform. Two years ago, I spoke with a group of women in Sacramento whose husbands were serving in the National Guard in Iraq. 
   One woman told me she had to buy her husband a Kevlar vest and a canteen before he deployed to Iraq, something all too many families were doing for their loved ones because the military was not providing it. A short time later, the administration assured the public that the issue had been addressed. And yet just this week we heard reports that the Army lacks armored Humvees and other equipment necessary for the troop increase the President is implementing; once again, a failure in vision and planning, and once again, our troops pay the price. 
   Escalation of this conflict will further increase the strain on a military that is already stretched to the breaking point. Every Member of this Chamber knows this. Earlier this month, I spoke with a friend and reservist in Sacramento named Richard Beach. Richard shipped out to Iraq 4 years ago as a chaplain in the Army Reserves. He is home now. But he still keeps in touch with his old unit. Richard shared with me a note he sent to some of his fellow members of the 114th. 
   He wrote, ``I remember 4 years ago we were getting ready for our trip to Fort Lewis and then on to Iraq. I hope as the fourth anniversary of the war comes up, you are all in good health and living life to the fullest. I, too, pray that soon this war will end and we will stop sending our soldiers off to war.'' 
   Four years later, he reports that many of the same soldiers and their families are making the same sacrifice. But that is a heartbreaking reality here. Implementing the President's policy will mean that members of his regiment along with so many others will have to endure more and more of the back-to-back deployments to Iraq. 
   The notion of shared sacrifice is something that helped make this country great. Americans are strong believers in shared sacrifice. But all too often in this war, only our troops and their families share the sacrifice. That is too much to ask on behalf of policies that have not worked. 
   The administration offers us scant reason to believe this troop increase will work when it has tried and failed with several previous troop increases. This proposal offers us nothing but more of the same. 
   Our brave men and women in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them. It is our political leadership that has failed. There is a saying, It takes two people to speak the truth: one to speak it and one to hear it. I hope the administration will choose to hear the truth and I hope that we pass this resolution today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. This bill is a good example of Congress taking action to address the needs of America's businesses and consumers. 
   Mr. Speaker, our economy is in a downturn. More and more Americans are feeling insecure about their future, and they are looking to this Congress for relief. The tax extenders package that is before us today will help millions of working families cope with everyday expenses of life from tuition to the cost of caring for their children. It will also move our Nation forward to meet the many energy challenges we face. 
   Investing in renewable resources is the best long-term strategy to reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower energy costs. Clean energy is also a major economic engine that will power the economy of the future. 
   In my hometown of Sacramento, clean energy investments made years ago are now sustaining over 90 local businesses, from solar and wind companies, to cellulosic fuel and green building enterprises. Clean energy has changed my district's business climate forever. Sacramento's clean energy economy can be replicated across this country, but Congress needs to provide the right incentives to make this vision a successful reality. This bill will help current and future generations live in a country with a healthier economy, a cleaner environment, and a more sustainable policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2262, HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 780 provides for consideration of H.R. 2262, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. It also makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute reported by the Natural Resources Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. My home State of California is what it is today because of the business of mining. When James Marshall discovered gold in the American River in my area more than two centuries ago, California was not yet a State. 
   The economic boom that followed the discovery of gold helped to remake the West. It infused our young Nation with renewed energy and capital. It began one of the most well-known episodes in our country's history: the Gold Rush. 
   Without mining, the City of Sacramento, which I represent proudly, would probably not be the capital of the largest State in the Union. Without mining, States like Nevada and Utah would be without the economic basis upon which they are now growing. Without mining, the western half of the United States would be a different place. 
   But in the West, Mr. Speaker, we have more than hardrock minerals. We also have rivers, streams, mountain ranges, and millions upon millions of people. These are natural resources just like gold and silver, and they must be protected from environmental harm. 
   Unfortunately, the law that currently governs mining operations is extremely outdated. It was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant. This was during the time when miners used shovels and pickaxes. Now, huge machines and industrial equipment are the tools of the mining trade. 
   Times have changed, Mr. Speaker. In the year 2007, we recognize that the term ``natural resources'' includes more than what we extract from the Earth. Its definition now encompasses the whole environment in which we live, from the water we drink, to the land we farm, to the air we breathe. 
   All Americans have a stake in preserving this environment, Mr. Speaker, and mining companies should contribute their fair share. However, they currently enjoy access to Federal land that no other industry does, not natural gas, not oil shale, not coal. 
   Under the 1872 law, mining companies pay next to nothing to extract metal from publicly owned lands. American taxpayers foot the bill for the extensive environmental remediation that many abandoned mines require. 
   Other old mines simply never get cleaned up. They sit empty and vacant, leaching chemicals into groundwater, polluting watersheds, and posing safety hazards for the public. After 135 years' worth of this subsidy, it is long past time for mining companies to pay their fair share. 
   This bill received three subcommittee hearings and a full committee hearing that stretched over 2 days. The rule makes in order seven total amendments, five of which are Republican. 
   This legislation has been considered and debated in the best tradition of the U.S. Congress. It is good environmental policy in the very same tradition. It is also good social policy. The bill also takes into account industry concerns and provides economic assistance to mining communities. One-third of the revenue created by this bill will go to a community assistance fund to help mitigate the social and economic impacts of the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, my hometown of Sacramento grew up around a place called Sutter's Fort. It was originally built to be a base for agricultural trade. The discovery of gold in the foothills northeast of Sutter's Fort changed its history and the history of our Nation forever. Because of gold, what was once Mexican territory soon became our 31st and most prosperous State.  
   Mining has left a permanent imprint on this country. Yes, it has led to increased economic gain and the development of the western United States. At the same time, it has had negative impact on our public lands. As Members of Congress, we are stewards of this Federal land. We have the responsibility to update our laws so that the mining industry helps ensure that our public lands and natural resources are preserved for future Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I'd like to say that we are discussing H.R. 2262, and it's about more than protecting water quality and preserving the environment, which it does. It also takes into account industry concerns and provides economic assistance from mining communities. One-  third of the revenue created by this bill will go to a community assistance fund to help mitigate the social and economic impacts of this legislation. 
   Both the Rules and Natural Resources Committees held hearings on this bill, during which time Republicans and Democrats were given the opportunity to offer amendments to the bill. In fact, the Natural Resources Committee held four hearings on this bill that stretched over five different days. During this time, they adopted a bipartisan set of amendments. 
   After the bill made its way through the legislative process and maintained bipartisan support, the Rules Committee allowed for seven amendments to be considered on the floor. These seven amendments address major issues in the bill. This will give opponents the opportunity to debate on the floor the merits of key issues of the bill. Of the seven amendments allowed under this rule, more than half, five, are Republican amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that this bill is long overdue. It should have been passed decades ago. But it's never too late to strengthen current law so that it preserves the environment, protects communities, and addresses public safety. This legislation does all three. 
   I commend Chairman Costa and Chairman Rahall on crafting a balanced and bipartisan bill. This legislation is proof that we can reap the benefits of our Nation's abundant natural resources while also preserving them for future generations. 
   Metals like gold, silver and copper help make this country what it is, Mr. Speaker. How we manage these resources going forward will make us what we are in the future. 
   With that in mind, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment to this much-needed legislation. My amendment clarifies that river watersheds will be eligible to receive some of the cleanup funding that will be generated by this bill. 
   Watersheds are crucial for the health of our Nation. They help move our goods, preserve our ecosystems, and protect our communities from flooding. Managing our Nation's watersheds in a holistic and responsible way is essential. If we do not protect and maintain them, we jeopardize critical parts of our environment that support commerce and recreation. 
   In arid States like California, Nevada, and Utah, river watersheds are even more important to economic and environmental health. Watersheds support a variety of agricultural, economic, and recreational activities. In my home State of California, for example, the Sacramento River Watershed forms the basis for fertile farmland, thriving urban areas, and outdoor recreational opportunities. 
   However, many watersheds are located near active and abandoned mines. Years ago rivers represented great economic opportunity. Rivers are where many precious metals are located. But the drive for these minerals has left a negative environmental legacy. 
   In Nevada, more than 7,000 tons of mercury were deposited into the Carson River Watershed during the quest for silver. In the California foothills, tens of thousands of mines were dug for the gold that was discovered in the watershed running through my district. More than 4,000 of these abandoned mines pose environmental hazards. 
   We must protect these river watersheds that are vital to our way of life. That is why my amendment is needed. It does not change the underlying structure of this very good bill. But it does make it crystal clear that cleaning up watersheds affected by mining is a priority.  
   Mr. Chairman, mining impacts water all across the West. Our river watersheds feel the effects of mining to a great degree. Addressing these impacts requires a comprehensive management approach. My amendment is crafted, and offered today, with this in mind. And it acknowledges that good watershed management is a critical tool of maintaining our natural resource. It recognizes that by protecting watersheds, we are investing in a public good that all Americans use. And it ensures that this public good will be maintained for future generations. 
   I urge all Members to support my amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for yielding me this time. 
   I rise today to offer the ``Recognizing AmeriCorps Week'' resolution and give special thanks to AmeriCorps volunteers and organizations. 
   This week marks AmeriCorps Week, a nationwide acknowledgment and celebration of all that America volunteers have done for our country. The AmeriCorps program is vital to the growth and prosperity of our Nation. AmeriCorps members can be found in our small towns and in our big cities. They're motivated young men and women from every background imaginable. 
   For the past 15 years, more than 540,000 men and women have given over 705 million hours of service to our country and the citizens. Equally valuable, these men and women are experts in mobilizing local volunteers, allowing millions more to serve their communities in an organized and effectual way. 
   Like AmeriCorps volunteers, AmeriCorps Week is important because it inspires others to become involved. By recognizing the program and its accomplishments, we motivate individuals to become engaged and add one more person to the growing list of those offering optimism and aid. 
   Throughout this week, AmeriCorps organizations across this country are hosting hundreds of special events, making it even easier to become involved. In the gulf coast, for example, Habitat for Humanity and the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project will build tens of homes in a single week. This single event will involve 700 AmeriCorps members and thousands of other volunteers. 
   Additionally, this year's AmeriCorps Week pays special attention to the life-long contribution of AmeriCorps alumni. A recent study of AmeriCorps show that alumni of the program are much more likely to remain involved in the community long after their service has ended. Nearly 87 percent of former AmeriCorps members will go on to work in public service. They become our future leaders, public servants, government employees, and nonprofit organizers. Simply put, AmeriCorps  members learn to give for the rest of their lives. 
   AmeriCorps Week also provides a platform to highlight the valuable community organizations that deserve our support. Earlier this week, critical new AmeriCorps grants were announced. This funding provides necessary resources to some of America's most innovative and effective community organizations. 
   Those who support this resolution and AmeriCorps Week will be in good company. Dozens of State governors have issued AmeriCorps Week proclamations from local leaders to professional baseball teams. Thousands of diverse Americans are expressing their support for the AmeriCorps programs and its volunteers. These supporters recognize that AmeriCorps members do more than volunteer their time. They are ambassadors of hope, good will, and personal initiatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me, my fellow National Service Caucus cochairs, and the 40 bipartisan cosponsors of this resolution in support of AmeriCorps Week and these amazing volunteers.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066 AND SUPPORTING AND RECOGNIZING A NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from California (Mr. Berman) for yielding me time; and I would like to thank my good friend from California (Mr. Honda) for his leadership on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is a reminder that from great injustice can come great awakening. 
   We take up this resolution to mark the 65th anniversary of Executive Order 9066. The resolution is a reminder that each of us has a responsibility to ensure that something like Executive Order 9066 never happens again. 
   In a time of war, thousands of innocent American citizens were rounded up, forcibly removed from their homes, and shipped to internment camps. Sadly, this was an avoidable consequence of racial prejudice and wartime hysteria. The government at all levels was blinded by war. It is imperative that we learn the lesson this moment in history has taught us. That is why I applauded the creation of a grant program to preserve the internment camps and related historical sites where Japanese Americans were detained during World War II. We must preserve these camps as a physical, tangible representation of our government's failure to protect the constitutional right of every American, and also as a symbol of our Nation's ability to acknowledge our mistakes. Further, these designations will ensure that future generations will be able to visit the internment camps to gain a better understanding of the previous generation's experience. 
   Mr. Speaker, we may have won World War II; however, we were not victorious because of our treatment of Japanese, Italian, and German Americans, but in spite of it. 
   Now, 65 years later, we are once again engaged in armed conflict overseas, and once again the undertones of suspicion and mistrust toward particular groups of people lurk beneath the surface of our society, which is why it is more important than ever to recall our past, so we do not repeat our mistakes. 
   I hope every American will take this day to reaffirm their commitment to our Constitution and the rights and protections it guarantees to all of us. The resolution before us today recognizes the past injustices and points the way toward a future where such wrongs are no longer perpetuated in this country. Each Member of this Congress as a servant of the people is duty bound to apply these lessons of the past to the challenges we now face. In doing so, we show our continued efforts toward ensuring that our country avoids similarly misguided policies now and in the future.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 322, a resolution to recognize the 60th anniversary of one of our most steadfast and vital allies: Israel. 
   Although it was created at a time of great international uncertainty, from its inception Israel has been a determined ally of the United States. Its history is a prime example of the strength that a commitment to political liberalism and equality of opportunity can afford even the smallest and most vulnerable state. 
   Israel is a nation that has weathered constant threats from outside its borders, indeed, that was born out of war and conflict. But despite its harsh beginnings, this inspirational country along the River Jordan has, for over half a century, fended off threats to its sovereignty and to its survival. And it has done so even as it has built a pluralistic society grounded in the highest ideals of equality, representative government, and democratic principles. 
   Mr. Speaker, a nation as threatened as Israel could certainly be excused for turning inward on itself, focusing on defending its territory and citizens against terrorism, and withdrawing from an international community that has increasingly targeted it with unfair sanctions and biased political statements. It is a testament to the character and inner strength of the Israeli people that they have not allowed their country to do so. 
   Instead, Israel has repeatedly volunteered its resources, manpower, and experience to help victims of disasters around the world. It has sent humanitarian aid and emergency medical supplies to war zones in Rwanda; disaster areas in Turkey, the Indian Ocean, and along the Gulf Coast; and, to fire-scorched areas in Greece. Israel's national mission is a higher calling than mere survival or self-perpetuation. It is an example to the world of the power of a determined national spirit, a citizenry dedicated to justice, and a set of founding principles that cannot be corrupted even by the constant threat of terrorism. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, terrorism is a serious and ever-present threat to Israel's sovereignty and menaces innocent Israeli citizens on a daily basis. As the number of rockets aimed at Israel by Hamas and other terrorist organizations has increased in recent days, the world has been reminded of the ugly intentions of those who refuse to discuss peace with the only democracy in the Middle East. 
   By contrast, Israel has demonstrated time and again that it is willing to make concessions to other countries in the name of peace. As a result, it now lives beside its Jordanian and Egyptian neighbors in relative calm. 
   However, organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, along with countries like Syria and Iran, have refused to take meaningful steps to forge similar agreements that could begin to heal the regional divisions that restrict the Middle East from reaching its full potential. For the past six decades, Israel has been strengthening its ties to the land upon which the Jewish people have lived for over 2,000 years. It is the security and identity of this land which Israel has the inalienable right to defend against existential and tactical threats. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H. Con. Res. 322 recognizes the many similarities between Israeli and American values, ideals, and interests. Our two peoples maintain an equal respect for the rule of law, democratic principles, and progressive ideals that have provided the foundations of our two societies for decades. 
   I join with many of my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives in highlighting my admiration for all that the nation of Israel has accomplished in the last 60 years. May this resolution before us today serve as the impetus for many more years of Israeli and American friendship, cooperation, and prosperity.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act (H.R. 1401). Our country needs this bill. Our communities need this bill. 
   This legislation is very timely for my district. On March 15th, a train trestle burned down just outside central Sacramento. The fire sent a dark plume of smoke into the sky. 
   The residents of our region received quite a scare. Children were kept inside because authorities could not determine if the smoke from the trestle fire was toxic. 
   Fortunately, no one was hurt. The incident is not being investigated as a terrorist attack. 
   However, this fire showcased the impact that our rail vulnerabilities can have on communities. 
   In Sacramento, our train tracks form a ring around our most populated areas. If the trestle had caught fire just a few miles down the track, houses would have burned. If the train had exploded, or if it had leaked hazardous material, my constituents could have died. 
   I cannot let that happen. That is why this legislation is so important. It makes critical advancements in rail security policy. 
   I am grateful that Representative Markey has addressed the transport of hazardous materials through heavily populated areas. 
   As the situation in Sacramento demonstrated, we must begin to reroute hazardous shipments to avoid populated areas. 
   When possible, we must integrate new technologies to secure these shipments. I look forward to working with Mr. Markey to implement this proposal. 
   It is also important to note that more people than ever are using public transit. Over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation last year. There has been a 30 percent increase in public transit use in the last decade. 
   This increased ridership is great news. However, it is important that we invest in security funding to match growing demand. This legislation will do just that. 
   Finally, I want to commend Chairman Bennie Thompson of the Homeland Security Committee for his leadership on this issue. 
   As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have seen how smoothly Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Thompson have collaborated. 
   They have done a great job dealing with the jurisdictional issues raised by transit security. 
   Their work demonstrates the level of commitment that is needed to secure our communities. Such collaboration is a refreshing change. 
   It should serve as an example for us all as we tackle other pressing issues facing the 110th Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Rule, so that we can enact this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Over 10 million Americans travel on cruise lines each year. Unfortunately, many are unaware that they are at risk of being victims of crime while on their vacations. And, it concerns me even more that these victims have inadequate access to assistance or law enforcement in the aftermath of a crime. 
   In recent years, the media has reported on a number of high-profile cases of passengers falling overboard, passengers going missing, and passengers being raped and sexually assaulted. Sadly, many of these cases remain unresolved, and the perpetrators of sexual violence and other violent crimes on cruise ships are rarely brought to justice. 
   I became personally involved after a constituent of mine, Laurie Dishman, came to me for assistance after she had been a victim of a violent crime on a cruise ship. 
   As a result of continued cases of crimes on the high seas, and with the leadership of Chairman Cummings, this Congress has held two hearings on safety on cruise ships. We learned that we must take action to inform people of exposure to risk while on cruise vacations. Mr. Chairman, sometimes even cruise ships need sunshine. 
   Our amendment seeks to do just that by requiring the Coast Guard to post on-line the number of deaths, missing persons, and reported crimes committed on cruise ships. The amendment also requires cruise lines to include a link to this data base on their public web sites. Our amendment would create transparency and promote a culture of accountability by allowing the public access to the number of crimes reported. 
   Prevention can be just as powerful as enforcement, and we all know that prevention starts with making people aware of the potential for a crime to occur. With prevention and enforcement, it is our hope that the tragic events that so many passengers have endured will not be repeated. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, the new Congress has begun and today we debate the first piece of our 100 hours agenda, H.R. 1--the implementation of some of the long-overdue bipartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   As I have stated on numerous occasions, national security is our highest priority. By passing these long-overdue 9/11 Commission recommendations today, we will be taking significant steps towards better protecting our country. This means scanning all air cargo loaded onto passenger planes and seaborne cargo containers shipped into the United States, as well as encouraging intelligence information sharing among federal, state and local agencies. 
   Further, it will increase the share of state homeland security grants provided to our communities, based on risk--an issue of particular concern to my home state of California. The current formula results in 40 percent of funding equally distributed to each state with the remainder allocated based on risk. With H.R. 1, each state is guaranteed a minimum of .25 percent of funding, while states that share an international border, or are connected to a body of water with an international border would receive at least .45 percent. This strikes a balance between risk-based allocations and ensuring a funding minimum for all states. Another result of this new distribution is that more funding will be directed towards essential programs such as the Urban Area Security Initiative, the State Homeland Security Grant program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention program. 
   Concerns have also been raised about the gaps in the Department of Homeland Security's critical infrastructure asset database. Over the past year, I have repeatedly highlighted overlooked infrastructure with DHS, which led to the Department making changes to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant. This bill will begin to close this gap by requiring annual assessments of information regarding critical infrastructure and the creation of a regularly updated asset databases. 
   As I have repeatedly stated, the federal government needs to do its job of protecting the American people. Part of that is providing leadership by setting standards as incorporated in H.R. 1 and the other is to provide resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress has had far too long to implement these critical reforms recommended by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. I am pleased to be able to vote today in favor of H.R. 1. I know that these reforms will direct our limited federal funds toward areas facing higher threats, and ensure further safety standards for our transportation systems. Through H.R. 1 we will ensure that our country is better protected against and prepared for any future terrorist attack.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. 
   The subprime housing crisis is a real threat to our economy. It has already had a devastating impact on our families, our neighbors, and our communities. My home district of Sacramento ranks among the hardest hit areas in the country. 
   My district ranks fifth in the Nation in adjustable rate mortgages that are expected to reset to higher rates in the future, putting more homeowners at risk of foreclosures. Just last quarter, close to 4,000 homes were foreclosed upon. Without decisive action, this crisis will continue to threaten many more hardworking Americans. As property values continue to fluctuate, it has become harder for many borrowers who are currently locked into these so-called teaser rates to refinance to more affordable loans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this crisis has affected every aspect our economy. Coupled with the rising gas and heating prices, our country is entering into a very cold winter indeed. In response, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates and produced more currency, which has further weakened the U.S. dollar to new lows, prompting inflation fears. 
   Mr. Speaker, we in Congress have a duty to address this crisis. Chairman Frank's bill is a step in the right direction. The bill establishes standards for home loans, while holding lenders and brokers accountable. The bill also prevents lenders and brokers from steering consumers to high-cost subprime loans just to make a quick extra buck. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to be a partner with the communities which we serve. We must work together to find a comprehensive strategy that will protect our homeowners.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, liberty and security are not mutually exclusive. Reliable intelligence is crucial for the defense of our Nation. Without it, we would not be safe. At the same time, civil liberties are a vital part of our national identity. Without them, we would not be free.  
   Our Founding Fathers understood that liberty and security complement each other. Unfortunately, this core premise has been muddled as we have debated FISA legislation. This legislation protects the people and the principles that we hold so dear in this country and it modernizes our Nation's intelligence laws to meet the technological demands of the 21st century. 
   I am especially pleased that the bill before us today provides such strong legal clarity. Without clear boundaries, intelligence officers will err on the side of caution. Strong legal footing not only protects our civil liberties; it also ensures that prosecutions will not be jeopardized. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people also deserve disclosure of the data that has been surrendered to the government by the telecommunications industry. It is critical for Congress to be fully informed before making such an important decision as granting retroactive immunity. Brave men and women have sacrificed to protect the civil liberties and values that we hold most dear. We cannot and should not lightly brush their contributions aside. Instead, we must honor their memories by taking responsible action to protect two of the things that our constituents hold most dear, our freedom and our national security. Neither of these basic American values can exist without the other. 
   I will continue to support bills like the RESTORE Act that recognize this essential truth. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support the Murphy, Matsui, Bean and Larson amendment. 
   I am sponsoring this amendment because it carries forward important public policy initiatives. It encourages local governments to develop comprehensive land use and zoning plans that include natural hazard mitigation. It also requires participating States to adopt internationally recognized building code standards. 
   I applaud the overall goal of this bill to provide access to insurance coverage for homeowners and disaster-prone communities. Our amendment today is about public safety. 
   As a representative from Sacramento, the Nation's most at-risk river city for catastrophic flooding, I am all too familiar with risk and vulnerability. Preparedness is a first step toward public safety. Strong building codes are key to being prepared and to reducing the damage caused by catastrophic events. This amendment ensures that States take steps to minimize risk. 
   Last week, I introduced the Safe Building Code Incentive Act of 2007 to encourage States to adopt stronger building codes. Our communities and homeowners should be better prepared, and Congress should be setting high standards for public safety. 
   Over the last few weeks, residents of my home State of California experienced devastating wildfires and an earthquake. We know that another event will occur and that it is only a matter of time. 
   To rapidly growing regions around the country such as Sacramento, the building standards we adopt now will ensure a safer future for our communities and property owners. 
   In January 2006, a Louisiana State University Hurricane Center study concluded that wind-related damage to homes by Katrina could have been reduced by 65 percent if current building code standards had been used. In short, we should be elevating public policy standards before disaster impacts our communities, not after. 
   Our amendment today raises the standard for public safety and encourages smarter planning to mitigate risk. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the progress to our Nation's competitiveness that the Patent Reform Act represents. Patents are vital to our universities, our large and small companies, our entrepreneurs, and our economy. Our advances in technology are clearly demonstrated by the vast increase in patent applications submitted. Our policies and procedures governing the United States patent process must be updated to keep pace with our inventors. The Patent Reform Act takes significant steps towards that goal. 
   I appreciate the extensive patent portfolio that is generated by the cutting-edge research at the University of California. These innovations provide the intellectual property that businesses depend on to develop new products. I have heard from numerous constituents in my district on this issue who benefit from the technology transfer process. I am happy to represent their interests by supporting patent reform. This is an incredibly complex topic, as we face the challenge of legislating a single patent system to meet the needs of many industries. 
   I commend Subcommittee Chairman BERMAN, Chairman CONYERS, Ranking Member SMITH, and the entire House Judiciary Committee for their diligence. They have worked tirelessly with hundreds of stakeholders to reach the carefully crafted bill that we have on the floor today. I thank the committee and its staff for their long commitment to patent reform. The product of their years of work, the Patent Reform Act, will improve our nation's competitiveness and start moving our country's patent system into the 21st century.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4040--the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act of 2007, not only as a Member of Congress, but as a grandmother as well. As I prepare to spend the holidays with my grandchildren, Anna and Robby, it makes me pause to consider how this legislation will benefit them and the children and grandchildren across the country. This year we have witnessed an unprecedented number of dangerous toys and products make their way to the shelves of American stores, resulting in thousands of recalls and Safety warnings. We cannot allow this trend of unsafe products in our homes to continue. Congress must act. 
   The bill before us today, which I am proud to co-sponsor, will improve the ability for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, to protect the American public from unsafe products. The CPSC has the enormous  task of monitoring approximately 15,000 types of products. Over 27,000 deaths and 33 million injuries are associated with consumer products each year. We must ensure that the CPSC has the resources and authority necessary to ensure that the toys and products that we buy for our loved ones are safe. This legislation does precisely that. 
   The Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act takes a number of important steps to keep our children and grandchildren safe. For the first time, we will have a standard set for levels of lead in children's products. This will be one of the most rigorous standards in the world. It will also increase civil penalties against manufacturers of hazardous products, and establish a third-party certification and testing system for children's products. These and the many other provisions contained within H.R. 4040 will provide the CPSC with the tools required to monitor the evergrowing number of products under its jurisdiction. 
   Created in 1973 during the height of the consumer movement, the CSC was unfortunately downsized during the 1980s. It has never recovered from those changes, and has not been updated since 1990. Today's legislation will also expand the authority of the CPSC to ensure that only safe toys and products are in our stores and homes. 
   The CPSC exists to protect Americans from harmful products. We expect that consumer products have been adequately screened and deemed safe before they hit the shelves of our stores. Only by updating the CPSC and expanding its authority can it's mission be accomplished in today's globalized market. Public safety must always trump other concerns. The generations of lawmakers that have gone before us had the wisdom to invest in this agency, and it is now our responsibility to modernize and make long overdue improvements to the CPSC that will keep American families safe and restore faith in the agency. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Dingell and the rest of the Energy and Commerce Committee for their hard work on this bill. The legislation that we are considering today has enjoyed strong bipartisan support, clearly demonstrated by its unanimous approval by the full committee. I hope that the House will come together in a similar bipartisan way to advance this important bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008. 
   This bill is the first step on the long road back to re-investing in our environment after years of neglect. It is a much-needed turnabout from the practice of treating the natural world merely as a source of material, rather than as the human race's one and only home. It is a necessary reversal of past policies which disregarded the value of clean water, clean air, and our public lands. 
   It represents the commitment of the new Democratic majority to strengthening the long-term viability of our environment. At the same time, it protects public health and demonstrates how important it is for us to act as stewards for our communities. 
   Treating our wastewater before it is discharged into our oceans and rivers is a crucial part of this process. However, the equipment and infrastructure that we use to clean our wastewater is rapidly aging. It no longer has the capacity to treat the amount of waste produced by our growing population. My constituents in Sacramento have battled this problem for years. When heavy rains come, the specter of sewers overflowing into our streets can become a harsh reality.  
   That is why I am so pleased that the Appropriations Committee has used this legislation to renew our commitment to clean water infrastructure. H.R. 2643 increases water-related research, restores funding for clean water grants to States, and directs greater resources to cleaning up contaminated groundwater sites. In doing so, this bill recognizes that investing in clean water protects our drinking supply, restores our rivers and lakes, and strengthens public health. 
   Mr. Chairman, Americans across the country--and in particular the people I represent from Sacramento--will benefit from this legislation's clean water provisions. No longer will we have to worry about untreated wastewater stagnating in our streets and polluting our rivers. No more will raw sewage seep into basements, public parks, and other areas where young children play. 
   When we pass this bill, the water our constituents drink will be cleaner. The rivers they swim in will house fewer bacteria. The sewers they rely on to transport wastewater will stop overflowing. Every Member of Congress has an interest in solving the problems of overwhelmed wastewater infrastructure, and H.R. 2643 begins to do so. 
   While this bill is but a beginning, Mr. Chairman, I am confident that the Democratic Congress will use it as a building block to continue restoring past cuts to clean water programs. The tangible benefits of this bill's clean water funding levels are considerable, but they are still just the first step in renewing our country's commitment to that basic building block of life that sustains us all. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2643.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 517 provides for consideration of H.R. 2829, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for 2008 under an open rule. 
   Under this rule, all Members of the House are afforded the opportunity to offer any amendment that is germane and otherwise complies with House rules. In fact, I want to point out to Members that this is the sixth appropriations bill this year to be considered under an open rule. 
   In November, the American people demanded a change in direction in Washington and a change in priorities. The past 6 months have been an important down payment on our commitment to change. This new Congress must continue to restore our focus on a domestic agenda that helps all Americans. 
   To that end, today the House takes up the seventh of its annual Appropriation bills where we will continue this progress in taking America in a new direction. 
   I applaud Chairman Serrano, Ranking Member Regula, and the committee for developing a bill that reflects this needed change in priorities and for doing so through a strong, bipartisan process. 
   This bill aims to spur job creation and make the economy work for everyone by restoring cuts to small business loans, strengthening consumer protections and rejecting a proposal to reduce capital and financial services to underserved communities through CDFI. 
   In addition, the funding in the underlying bill will help our citizens to vote through upgrades to voting machines and voter registration databases. It ensures a fair tax system by enforcing the Tax Code for everyone, not just those who play by the rules. By focusing on basic priorities like these, we can help restore the American people's faith in our government again. 
   The programs funded by this bill demonstrate our commitment to serving all Americans, regardless of economic or social background. The $21.4 billion bill includes: $66.8 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect the public from injury or death from more than 15,000 types of consumer products; 
   $247.7 million for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate sub-prime lending, ID theft, and other deceptive practices; 
   $908 million for the Securities and Exchange Commission to enhance securities law enforcement; 
   $313 million for the Federal Communications Commissions to oversee the changing telecom environment, ensure the continued livelihood of Universal Service Fund and prepare for the transition to digital television; 
   $139.8 million to combat terrorist financing; 
   $5.9 billion for the Federal Courts, including $830.5 million for defender services, because every American should  have access to quality legal representation. 
   The bill also includes $582 million for the Small Business Administration to help small businesses prosper. Of this, $100 million is for Small Business Development Centers, or SBDCs, which is the highest ever funding level for this program. These centers provide management assistance to current and prospective small business owners. In addition, they support existing businesses and assist start-ups with high-quality, no-cost counseling and affordable training programs. 
   This support for our small businesses helps invigorate local economies by helping the very small businesses that are firmly rooted in our communities both succeed and grow. There are now 63 main SBDCs, at least one in every State, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with a network of more than 1,100 service locations. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill made in order under this open rule is a well-crafted piece of legislation. I appreciate that the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee worked together to produce such a product. The bill ensures taxpayer fairness, protects the right to vote, and funds programs critical to supporting our Nation's small businesses. 
   I urge all Members to support this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I want to make a brief comment regarding the Members' COLA which, as Members know, is provided for not in this bill but directly through the Treasury Department based on a predetermined formula. 
   When we had a debate last year, Members on our side of the aisle objected to the rule on the grounds that Members should not receive a cost of living increase until average Americans did through an increase in the minimum wage. 
   I am happy to report that the Democrats kept their promise. No COLA was permitted in the long-term funding that Democrats passed earlier this year to resolve last year's appropriations gridlock. As a result of the new majority's leadership, we passed the first increase in the minimum wage in almost 10 years. It goes into effect on July 24, just less than a month from now.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to make a comment on the Members' COLA once again, that the Members' COLA was calculated by a predetermined automatic formula. This legislation does not address Members' COLA. Changes to Members' COLA formula should be addressed in authorizing legislation from the Committee on House Administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people expect and deserve the best services their government can offer and their tax dollars pay for. This $21.4 billion bipartisan bill provides significant support to our small businesses, helps guarantee our citizens' right to vote, and works to close the tax gap. It is a good bill. I believe through simple measures such as these, we can restore our citizens' faith that the government can, and is, working for them again.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6003, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 1253 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The resolution provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and makes in order 8 of the 10 amendments submitted for consideration. 
   From coast to coast we are seeing the effects of rising fuel prices. Energy prices have been a regular topic here in Congress, in the newspapers, and at family dinner tables. 
   The average price of a gallon of gas in Sacramento just climbed to $4.41. My constituents are feeling this burden every single day. Driving to work and school is becoming more difficult and more costly for everyone. 
   The City of Sacramento also just started a major construction project on I-5, which cuts through the heart of my district. The already congested streets are going to become even more crowded.     
   That is why I am glad we are here considering such an important bill to reauthorize and invest in Amtrak. Our constituents are in desperate need of alternative modes of travel to combat both increased congestion as well as rising gas prices. Now is the time to capitalize on the renewed interest in passenger rail. 
   Millions of Americans from Atlanta to Sacramento are getting out of their cars and onto public transit. Many of these riders will be getting on rail for the first time. We must not let the opportunity to invest in our rail system pass us by. 
   From Greece to Paris to Tokyo, we have seen the economic benefits of intercity rail. Let's now bring these benefits to our Nation, our States, and our hometowns. 
   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act takes great strides to improve Amtrak and give our constituents the flexibility they need to travel. 
   Amtrak was created in 1970 to preserve and reinvigorate intercity passenger rail service throughout the country. Since 1981, it has been the Nation's sole provider of regularly scheduled intercity passenger rail service. 
   In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight fiscal year of record ridership. Increased ridership numbers occurred across all of Amtrak's services in both corridor and long-distance routes. On average, more than 70,000 passengers ride on Amtrak every day. 
   Amtrak's financial performance has also improved in recent years, posting record gains in ticket sales. My region has seen the positive effects and benefits of having efficient transportation options. The Capitol Corridor line in California is showing that record numbers of Californians are choosing to use passenger rail. Ridership on the Capitol Corridor line is up 14 percent and revenue is up 21 percent from last year. On-time performance was also up from last year. 
   We can all agree that Amtrak needs to be brought into the 21st century. This legislation provides a comprehensive framework to improve Amtrak across the country. It increases capital and operating grants to Amtrak, helps bring the Northeast Corridor to a state of good repair, and makes various capital improvements. 
   H.R. 6003 also creates a new grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects. Our urban centers will see tangible benefits and a commitment to getting cars off the streets by promoting alternative and efficient modes of transportation. 
   H.R. 6003 takes great strides to relieve rail congestion. It provides important congestion grants and works to resolve disputes between commuter and freight railroads. It also provides significant funding for high-speed rail corridors, including $1.75 billion for construction and equipment. 
   Simply put, this bill will reduce congestion and facilitate ridership growth. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for coming together on this important bipartisan legislation. I am proud that this Congress is taking this important issue and tackling it, and look forward to supporting this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act is an important step to demonstrating our commitment to infrastructure investment. This is long overdue, and I encourage everyone to support the rule and the underlying legislation to provide the country with a safe and alternative mode of travel. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, before I yield to the next speaker, I just want to remind my colleagues that all of the  Nation's major transportation systems receive significant Federal investment, with good reason. Investment in rail infrastructure creates jobs, helps with congestion, decreases our dependence on oil, and offers viable alternatives for many of our citizens, including the elderly and disabled.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I'd just like to say that this bill creates a new State Capital Grants program for intercity passenger rail projects. These grants will help fund new facilities and equipment for intercity passenger rail and help move commuters off the roads and pollution out of the air. 
   The bill also authorizes $1.75 billion to develop 11 high-speed rail corridors. These corridors will help remove cars from the highway and reduce pollution. 
   With that, I would like to reserve my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, first of all, at the end of the Clinton administration, oil was $27 a barrel. It is now $134 a barrel. A significant increase. And my friends on other side of the aisle are attempting to blame this newly elected Democratic Congress--I think someone on the other side said we have been here for 18 months--for this increase. 
   Furthermore, every bill that the Democrats bring before this Congress that attempts in any way, shape, fashion, or form to reduce the use and therefore the price of oil, the other side of the aisle votes ``no.'' 
   The response to high oil prices was to give the big oil companies tax breaks. Well, that's not the priority of this Democratic Congress. 
   I want to talk about alternative energy. We want to invest in alternative modes of transportation like passenger rails which would take 8 million cars off the road. We want to reduce the dependence on foreign oil, the dependence on gas and on fossil fuels thereby making our country stronger both domestically and internationally. 
   The other side wants to talk about tax breaks for oil and gas companies. We're talking about investing in Amtrak and making our streets less congested, our skies cleaner, and our country less reliable on oil and gas. 
   What that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I want to remind everybody that investing in Amtrak is an energy-efficient way to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. One rail line can carry the equivalent of 16 highway lanes, and Amtrak uses 50 percent less energy per passenger than air travel.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   The rule before us today is a fair rule that allows us to highlight transportation challenges and our vision for a better tomorrow. It is Congress' responsibility to provide our constituents with alternative modes of transportation, especially as we see increased congestion and ever rising gas prices. 
   The Democratic majority is fighting to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices and launch a cleaner, smarter energy future for America that lowers costs and creates hundreds and thousands of green jobs. This is a marked change from the 7 years of the current administration's energy policies of simply drilling for more fossil fuels and providing even greater taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies already earning record profits. 
   The underlying bill, H.R. 6033, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, takes huge steps to modernize Amtrak and give it the tools it needs to operate effectively and efficiently. 
   By giving this Nation viable passenger rail, we will be able to decrease our dependence on foreign oil and give commuters options to get to work and school. In fact, Amtrak takes 8 million cars off the road. 
   We have a commitment to maintain and improve the backbone of our Nation's transportation infrastructure system. This bill does just that, and I urge its adoption. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California for yielding me time. 
   I rise today in strong support of the rule we are considering on the conference report to H.R. 2419, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, this important conference agreement outlines the funding for our country's agriculture policy, its conservation approaches, and its nutrition programs. These initiatives touch each of us in some way. Whether we're from a rural area, suburban or urban area, the farm bill has impact on every single one of us. 
   As a farmer's daughter, I understand how the food we produce is truly the backbone of our country. I am proud of our Nation's commitment to a strong farm economy and a long-standing tradition of providing a safe and secure food supply, not only for our country but for the world. 
   That is why I support this bill. From the $10 billion increase in nutrition programs to the $7.7 billion increase in conservation funding, this legislation provides for our entire country. I've spoken to our producers, and this legislation gives them the safety net they need to continue producing the food supply our Nation relies upon. I am pleased with the balance and vision in this bill, and that is why I will strongly support it. 
   I'd like to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for all of their work on this bill. The chairman has shown exceptional leadership and patience through this process. This bill turns the page and helps start a new era of farm and nutrition policy. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Peterson and the committee for their inclusion of provisions of the House-passed Regional Water Enhancement Program. By including the Sacramento River Watershed as a national priority in the conference report, my region will be able to preserve farmlands, as well as provide a comprehensive approach to ground and surface water. 
   Our initial focus should be on building a strong consensus on conservation and its value for our region. We have a truly unique opportunity to shape the vision for the watershed from the beginning. This will help ensure that we build upon solid, local input. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be standing here today in support of this well-crafted bill. I ask my colleagues to support the rule and the final passage of the farm bill conference report.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   There are over 15 million Asian Americans living in the United States, from the early Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino immigrants to recent Vietnamese, Laotian and Hmong communities. The United States has benefited many ways from the contributions of these diverse cultures. 
   Through the telling of the Asian Pacific American experience, we illuminate the quality of opportunity that makes our country the wonderful place it is. From community involvement to business entrepreneurship, many Americans of Asian descent came to this country with very little and have been able to achieve the American Dream. 
   Asian Americans have also played a critical role in protecting our freedoms. During World War II, the Federal Government chose to intern 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent, including my mother and father and their entire families. The country learned the importance of balancing civil liberties  with national security, and today, more than ever, we must be aware of the significance of this fine balance. 
   I am proud to honor the courageous Americans who fight against injustice and recognize the strength and vibrance of our country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the reappointment of Roger Sant to the Smithsonian Board of Regents. 
   I am a new member of the Board of Regents since January. And although the past eleven months have been challenging for the Smithsonian . . . this period of transition will result in a new Secretary, an improved governance structure and a stronger relationship with Congress and the American people. I believe that much of the changes can be attributed to Mr. Sant's leadership during this time. 
   In March, Mr. Sant led the effort to create both an Independent Review Committee, headed by Chuck Bowsher, formerly the Comptroller General of the United States ..... and an internal Governance Committee, on which I serve. 
   As a result of both of the committees' work, the Regents adopted a comprehensive set of governance reforms, comprised of 25 specific changes in June, 2007. In broad terms, these reforms will ensure that the Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian work together in a constructive partnership, and will improve the Smithsonian's culture of accountability and transparency. To date, eleven of these 25 reforms have been implemented in whole or in part, and the remainder will be implemented by May, 2008. 
   Additionally, Mr. Sant serves on the new Facilities Revitalization Committee. The Committee is addressing shortfalls in funding for Smithsonian facilities revitalization and maintenance, estimated to require $1 billion above current funding levels over the next ten years. The Regents are hard at work developing a plan to fund this shortfall and return the Smithsonian's museums and other facilities to the condition expected by the American public. 
   My colleagues and I on the Board of Regents are fully committed to ensuring that the Institution operates at the highest level of integrity and transparency. Mr. Sant has been involved at every level of reform and has done a tremendous amount of work, as have my fellow Regents. The Board is guided by the same principals that guide our work in Congress . . . operating as a public trust . . . following only the highest ethical standards . . . and conducting business with an increased ethos of transparency. 
   The Board's accomplishments during these few months are notable, as are its plans for future improvements. The Board of Regents is currently conducting a search for a new Secretary, and is still in the midst of a thorough and thoughtful process to reform its governance structure. We have the momentum and the dedication from the Board Members and need to be able to continue our work. 
   I applaud Chairman Brady and Ranking Member EHLERS for moving Mr. Sant's reappointment at this time. And for their continued commitment to the betterment of the Institution. 
   Let me conclude by saying that each year, over 25 million visitors come to the Smithsonian. The National Collections, containing over 135 million items, are cared for, displayed, and made available for research by this beloved institution. 
   The Smithsonian faces many challenges as it pursues its mission for ``the increase and diffusion of knowledge.'' While the Board works to find a new Secretary, institute governance reforms and address facilities needs ..... the Smithsonian continues to mount world-class exhibitions and conduct cutting-edge research in science, history, art, and culture. 
   The Smithsonian offers a uniquely American experience to all of our constituents when they come to the nation's capitol. Mr. Sant's dedication and commitment to the Smithsonian benefit us all. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support his reappointment to ensure that all of the reforms that he has helped to implement are executed in a prompt and timely manner. I thank him for his leadership during this period of transition.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today today to express my support for the National Textile Center. Textiles are an important part of our daily life and of our Nation's economy. It is imperative that we remain internationally competitive in this industry. The National Textile Center does exactly that--ensure that the fiber, textile, and apparel industries in our country have the research and innovations needed to continue to be viable and competitive. 
   The National Textile Center is a consortium of eight coordinated locations across the country. They have come together in a nationwide effort to promote research and education in developing new and innovative fabrics and materials. These are important collaborative centers that develop new fibers, fabrics, and manufacturing methods with broad ranging applications. 
   I am proud that one of the partners of the National Textile Center is the University of California Davis. Their participation in this national research consortium benefits the education, workforce development, and economy of the Sacramento region and our entire country. A key project at U.C. Davis funded by the National Textile Center is the development of new personal protection clothing to keep our first responders and military safe. We cannot turn our backs on these vital workers, whom we trust with the health and safety of our Nation. 
   The National Textile Center funds important interdisciplinary collaborations that translate to many other industries. Basic research funded by this important consortium has applications that will reverberate in many fields, such as biomedical applications, electronics, and nanotechnology. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting funding of the National Textile Center. We need to oppose efforts to strike funds from this important program that benefits constituents nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule we are considering today. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 is an important bill that outlines the funding for our country's agriculture policy, its conservation approaches and its nutrition programs. These initiatives touch each of us in some way, whether we're from rural, suburban or urban districts. The farm bill impacts all of us. 
   I want to applaud Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Goodlatte and Speaker Pelosi for bringing forward this fine bill. 
   My district is in one of the fastest growing areas in California. Sacramento is also at the bottom of one of the most farm-rich watersheds in the country. We are at the confluence of two great rivers, the American and, our namesake river, the Sacramento. 
   As our population grows and as our climate continues to change, our natural resources are impacted first. Farmland is often the first to feel the effects of changing weather and climate patterns, and in the Sacramento watershed the farmers are the stewards of the land. I'm ready to work with local landowners to develop voluntary comprehensive conservation plans that address present and future needs. 
   I want to thank Chairman Peterson for working with me to designate the Sacramento River watershed as a region of national priority in the regional water enhancement program. This designation and the promise of future funding will go a long way toward developing the Sacramento River watershed over the next 40 years. 
   Building on this designation, I look forward to convening a coordinating committee which will address the preservation of working lands and water management within the watershed. 
   Our initial focus will be to build a strong consensus on conservation and its value for our region. We have a truly unique opportunity to shape the vision for the watershed from its inception. This will help ensure that we build upon solid local input as we develop this vision. 
   Above the city of Sacramento, there are 500,000 acres of rice and 500,000 acres of specialty crops. My district is proof that the distance between urban and rural communities gets smaller every single day. 
   Our communities have different needs, but we share a common goal: to protect, preserve and enhance our way of life. I believe that preserving working lands can do just that. This should be an important priority for our entire region. 
   Finally, I applaud the chairman's commitment in providing $1.6 billion to specialty crop producers. These funds are critical to the producers' daily operations. They will foster progress in research, conservation, pest and disease programs and nutrition. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time and I rise in support of H. Res. 1357. 
   Mr. Speaker, on August 10, 2008, this Nation will acknowledge the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Liberties Act. This anniversary is an opportunity for all Americans to appreciate our Nation's willingness to admit and remedy its past mistakes, and for Americans to learn from these past mistakes. We must never forget that from past injustice can come great awakening. And today, we remember the past to preserve our future freedoms. 
   On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to internment of over 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent, including my mother and my father, my grandparents, my aunts and my uncles and all their friends. During that moment, our government, at all levels, was blinded by war and made decisions that are contrary to our Constitution. 
   The failure of each branch of government to uphold the rights of individuals must be taught so that future generations resist succumbing to the politics of fear. 
   It took nearly three decades before the government began to acknowledge this failure. President Gerald Ford formally rescinded Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1976. And shortly after, Congress passed legislation which was signed by President Jimmy Carter on July 31, 1980. 
   The bill established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and internment of civilians. Its charge was to investigate the internment of Japanese Americans and legal resident aliens during World War II. 
   After hearing from over 750 witnesses, over 20 days of hearings, the Commission published a report entitled Personal Justice Denied. And I might say that for many of these individuals, that was the first time they ever talked about the internment. 
   The Commission concluded that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity. It went on to find that the decision to issue the order was shaped by race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership. 
   Because of these compelling findings, Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 with bipartisan support. The bill granted reparations for interned Japanese Americans. It also formally acknowledged the fundamental injustices resulting from the Executive Order, apologized on behalf of the people of the United States for those injustices, and vowed to discourage similar injustices and violations of civil liberties in the future. 
   And today, 20 years later, we can reaffirm this commitment because of one of the darkest periods of our Nation's history, we learned of the damage that can be done when we let the politics of fear cloud our judgment. 
   Our efforts to preserve this painful period of our country's history continue to this day. Many of my colleagues are working to support internment site preservation as a physical reminder of past inequality. It is important that future generations will be able to visit the internment camps to gain understanding of the burdens of past generations that have allowed us to live in a free and just society today. 
   But there is still work to be done. During the interviews the Commission discovered efforts of the United States Government during World War II to relocate and intern approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of Japanese descent. These individuals were not only taken from their country to be interned in another country, but they were also exchanged for United States citizens held by axis nations. 
   Additionally, the government classified German-born and Italian-born immigrants as enemy aliens and required them to carry identification. They restricted their property rights and travel rights during this time period and arrested, interned and detained thousands of European Americans. 
   All of those who suffered from misguided government policies during  World War II deserve to have their stories come to light. Their experience should be fully recognized and preserved for future generations to learn from. 
   I hope every American will take this anniversary to reaffirm their commitment to our Constitution and the rights and protections it guarantees all of us. This commitment is a way to prevent such injustice from ever becoming a reality again. 
   As you look back on a time in our Nation's history and how our country has responded since, we should have hope for the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2095, FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 724 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007. The resolution provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The rule makes four amendments in order. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   As the debate in the Rules Committee demonstrated, Members on both sides of the aisle are focused on getting this bill to conference and onto the President's desk, and this rule reflects that consensus. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown for their leadership in addressing rail safety issues. Attention and investment to the safety of our rail infrastructure and workers is needed. 
   Congress last reauthorized the Federal Railroad Administration, also known as FRA, rail safety programs in 1994 and that authorization lapsed in 1998. In the time since Congress last took a comprehensive look at railroad safety, much has changed with our Nation's freight and passenger rail infrastructure. The amount of goods transported by rail has increased dramatically and more often our population is turning to rail as an alternative to getting into their cars. This is creating a greater demand on our rail infrastructure. 
   The bill before us today, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007, would authorize our Federal rail safety programs at $1.2 billion over 4 years. This bill makes important investments in our current rail safety programs and creates new grant programs for grade crossing safety and train control technology. 
   Additionally, the importance of safety will be reflected in the renaming of the FRA to the Federal Railroad Safety Administration. This is significant because a new name would emphasize the Federal role in the safety of rail transportation. 
   A fresh look at rail safety is long overdue. Over the next 20 years, the demand for freight and passenger rail is expected to grow and continue to play an important role in our economy and in our communities. Now is the time to make an investment in the safety of our rail infrastructure, as well as the training of the men and women who work on the rail lines. This way we can embrace the growth of our Nation's infrastructure and face it in a responsible way. 
   For example, the Department of Transportation has estimated that the amount of freight moved on rail will increase by 50 percent from 1998 to 2020. If you live in a community with a rail line, you are already experiencing this growth firsthand. In my district of Sacramento, there are two freight lines, and the largest railroad switching yard west of the Mississippi lies just outside of my district in Roseville. I understand how big a role freight lines play in a community. When something goes wrong with a freight line, the community knows about it immediately. Freight carried by these rail lines must be transported safely and securely, particularly when it travels through densely populated urban areas. 
   As the freight rail industry continues to grow, it will need a well-trained and safe workforce. Addressing safety and training issues now will benefit all our communities and our national economy in future years.     
   This bill makes that investment and nearly doubles the number of FRA inspectors from 440 to 800. 
   Safety on our passenger rail lines is equally important. In fiscal year 2007, close to 26 million passengers chose to take trains. This is a 6.3 percent increase from the previous year. We can only expect these ridership numbers to increase as Americans seek travel alternatives in an attempt to turn away from congested highways and overstressed airlines. 
   In northern California, the Capital Corridor line has shown incredibl increases in ridership. In 1998, 544,000 passengers traveled on the Capital Corridor line. In 2007, the Capital Corridor ridership has almost tripled to almost 1.5 million passengers. 
   In 2007, throughout the entire State of California, 5 million passengers rode  on rail. Translated to vehicle miles, that is 500 million miles, which, simply put, means half a billion vehicle miles not on our highways and thus saving gas, reducing congestion and not polluting our air. 
   I say this because we need to protect and encourage this upward trend not only in California but across the Nation. 
   To do this, it is important that we invest in safety at a proportional rate to our ridership growth and freight growth. Our citizens must continue to have confidence in our rail infrastructure. 
   Finally, the demand on our rail infrastructure has outgrown our ability to keep our rail system safe. We must also ensure that our rail workers are getting the training they need, but also the rest between shifts. 
   According to the FRA, 40 percent of all train accidents are the result of human factors, and one in four of those accidents result from fatigue. These accidents are preventable, and it's time that we address the problem. 
   This bill makes the necessary changes to address employee fatigue. It increases the minimum rest period for employees from 8 to 10 hours and also phases in a limit of 10 hours of the amount of limbo time an employee can accrue each month. 
   In closing, this bill addresses the critical issues of worker fatigue, timely and thorough inspections, as well as enforcement of safety regulations. In short, this bill reinstates rail safety as a top priority for our communities, workforce, and the millions of people who ride our rail lines. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida and yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me first say that the earmark rule is not waived in this rule despite the claims of my colleagues. I urge them to read lines 6 and 7, that the rule specifically excludes the earmark rule from the waiver. Any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is important to our economy and the millions of Americans who travel on trains every year. This is the first time in well over a decade that Congress has taken a comprehensive look at our rail safety programs. During that time, the demand on our freight and passenger rail infrastructure has increased dramatically. 
   This bill addresses the critical issues of worker fatigue, timely and thorough inspections, as well as enforcement of safety regulations. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for yielding me time. He has quickly become an excellent contributor to the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, Federal energy policy has been lagging behind forward-looking States like California. It is now time for the Federal Government to lead America's transformation to a clean energy economy. 
   Here in Congress, we must enact smart policies that demonstrate a serious commitment to changing the way this Nation produces and consumes energy. 
   In the House, we took an important first step as part of the 100-hours agenda when we repealed $14 billion in subsidies and incentives for oil companies, and redirected that money to a clean energy fund. 
   That legislation sent a clear and strong signal to our constituents and to industry. I can tell you that businesses, universities and research institutions in my hometown of Sacramento are enthusiastic about helping America move forward on clean energy technologies. 
   One of those technologies, biofuels, has tremendous potential to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and if we are serious about incorporating alternative fuels into the economy, we need to ensure that our infrastructure is compatible with them. 
   I am a cosponsor of H.R. 547 because it is a commonsense next step on biofuels. Chairman Gordon's legislation will allow for research and development to ensure that alternative fuels, such as E-85, biodiesel and advanced biofuels can be handled by our gas stations and pipelines. This is a smart investment because it makes a lot more sense to modify the existing infrastructure than to rebuild it. 
   I hope all my colleagues will be able to support this important legislation. But this is just a first step. We know that. Congress must continue to send signals that we are serious about transitioning to a clean energy economy. That means supporting the range of technologies, including clean alternative sources of energy such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass, as well as energy-efficient technologies for buildings and transportation. 
   Congress and the administration should not pick winners and losers. There will be no magic bullet. When it comes to research and development, we must hedge our bets. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 110th Congress to move toward a clean energy economy effectively and expeditiously. This is the most important domestic priority for Congress and a generational challenge for the Nation. There is absolutely no time to waste.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings). During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.     
   Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   The structured rule makes in order six amendments. As yesterday's debate in the Rules Committee demonstrated, Members on both sides of the aisle are focused on getting this bill to conference and onto the President's desk, and this rule reflects that consensus. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been well documented that our country has not had a WRDA bill in over 7 years. Seven years is perilously close to an entire generation passing without a national water resources policy being signed into law by a President. 
   The bill made in order under this rule authorizes nearly $14 billion for the construction of more than 700 water resources development projects and studies by the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, navigation, and environmental restoration. 
   Additionally, H.R. 1495 authorizes hurricane recovery activities along the gulf coast that would cost an estimated $3 billion. Furthermore, the bill requires an external peer review for studies of projects that would cost more than $50 million. The bill also coordinates environmental analyses and other permit processes among Federal and State agencies and authorizes environmental quality initiatives. In short, this bill today moves our country forward. 
   In my district of Sacramento, California, this WRDA bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass Congress this year. We have been waiting a long time for this bill. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city in this country for catastrophic flooding. Located at the confluence of the great Sacramento and American Rivers, the Sacramento floodplain contains over 165,000 homes, over 488,000 residents, 1,300 government facilities including the State capital, and businesses providing 200,000 jobs. It is the hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people. 
   A major flood along the American River or the Sacramento River would cripple this economy, and cost upwards of $35 billion in direct property damages and likely result in a significant loss of life. 
   Sacramento has had major floods throughout its history, the last major floods being in 1986 and 1997. We live with a constant threat of catastrophic flooding. In my district, we understand the need and urgency for an overarching water resources policy to protect our homes, businesses, and families. This bill, the projects and policies  it contains, goes a long way in addressing my district and our country's flood vulnerabilities. 
   Nationally, regions across the country are starving for a Federal partner in water resources policy. Our country is confronted with population growth, climate change and growing demands on our water infrastructure. Our districts across this country need this bill, and the Members in this Chamber have repeatedly supported WRDA bills. 
   In the 108th Congress, WRDA passed the House by a vote of 412-8. In the 109th Congress, WRDA passed the House 406-14. There is a strong history of support and bipartisanship for WRDA bills. It is my hope that this support continues and that we will move forward on this very important work. 
   I also want to congratulate and thank Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and the full committee chairman, Jim Oberstar, for their commitment to make this bill a priority in the 110th Congress. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the underlying Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. Our country needs a comprehensive water resources policy, and WRDA is the framework that can meet this need. We have 7 years of backlogged water projects that must be addressed. There is a growing demand on our already overburdened water infrastructure. The sooner we move forward on this bill, the sooner our communities across the country will be healthier and safer. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this rule and to enthusiastically support this solid and balanced budget resolution. It invests in strategic priorities for the future, while putting the Nation on the path to fiscal stability. 
   In approaching this debate, I would ask that Members and our constituents keep in mind that we are not starting from scratch. The previous leadership left us with a fiscal disaster that can't be repaired overnight. But this budget gets us on the right track in a responsible and strategic way. 
   That is governing. Governing is not easy. It requires making hard choices. But making hard choices today is better than Congress abdicating its responsibility to choose altogether. Because the alternative to making hard choices is passing debt on to tomorrow's decisionmakers, leaving our children and grandchildren, like my own Anna and Robby, with a diminished quality of life. 
   With PAYGO rules, the budget draws a line in the sand. If you want new mandatory spending or tax cuts, find a way to pay for it. 
   Shifting the burden on to the next generation is no longer an option under this budget. We are not going to eradicate the deficit as quickly as some would like, and we can't spend as much on domestic priorities as some would like. But this budget gives us the type of solid foundation that will allow us to tackle our fiscal challenges, while still investing in the most important priorities. 
   This budget recognizes that we need to invest in healthcare and education for our children. It recognizes that we must move to a clean energy economy by driving research and development and by promoting scientific innovation and that we must provide for our veterans, who have served honorably and deserve the best care possible. Finally, this budget recognizes that the Tax Code should be fair for hardworking families. 
   All of this is accomplished in a fiscally responsible manner, while ensuring the security of our Nation. That is a tremendous achievement, and I thank Chairman Spratt for his diligence in achieving this excellent legislative product. I urge my colleagues to provide the type of broad and enthusiastic support that it deserves.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, we are tasked with finding solutions that are innovative and multifaceted, to secure a better future for America. 
   Part of that responsibility is ensuring that young Americans have access to safe, constructive environments to learn in. 
   H.R. 3021 will help give our children and grandchildren the sound, healthy classrooms they need and deserve. It is clear that our schools are aging and in need of repairs ..... repairs that must be made to allow students to focus on learning and reaching their full potential. 
   Not only will we be investing in future generations of Americans, we will provide thousands of much-needed, high-quality jobs. 
   With the bill before us today, we are taking steps that will help address so many of the challenges we face. 
   The improvements made to schools will encourage green building techniques and help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. These standards will save school districts money on utilities for years to come.  
   In my district, the Natomas Unified School District, the state's only ``Climate Action Leader,'' recently received the Clean Air ``Government Award'' for its dedication to air quality and energy-saving techniques. It is innovative approaches like this that H.R. 3021 will encourage across the country. 
   I cannot help but think of my grandchildren, Anna and Robby; they are approaching school age, and I want them to be in a healthy environment that will enable them to reach their full potential. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the Rule and final passage of H.R. 3021.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 382 provides for consideration of H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill's consideration, except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for 21 amendments. 
   I am pleased to stand before you today with a rule to permit the Homeland Security authorization bill to come to the House floor. 
   First and foremost, I want to thank Chairman Thompson for his continued leadership on an issue of utmost importance for the safety and prosperity of this country and for working so closely with Ranking Member King on this bill. 
   This bipartisan bill authorizes $39.8 billion to the Homeland Security to carry out its many functions, from securing our borders to providing our local law enforcement with resources to prepare for and prevent terrorist attacks. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has a wide range of responsibilities. In recognition of this critical mission, I am pleased that the Homeland Security Committee has authorized $2.1 billion more than the President requested in his budget. This authorization bill does far more than simply authorize appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security.     
   This bill gets at the heart of the management problems within the Department. As we all know, the Department was created by combining the work of 22 separate agencies. This process of integration has had many, many challenges, poor communication between agencies, a lack of qualified management, unusually high turnover of senior personnel. 
   Congress has not made these challenges any easier, however. We could have addressed some of these problems through the legislative process by passing an authorization bill last year, but the prior majority failed to do so, and so the Department's management problems went uncorrected. 
   Without addressing the underlying management and operational issues, the Department cannot perform its important functions. In such an environment, how can the American people feel safe? 
   Thankfully, H.R. 1684 addresses these challenges. It mandates a comprehensive review of the Department at the beginning of each new administration in order to ensure that DHS is structured to meet the security needs of the American people. It sets qualifications for senior managers, increases coordination between agencies, and boosts funds for the Inspector General. And, agency by agency, it puts in place thoughtful personnel policies to attract, train and keep only the most qualified personnel. 
   These reforms are important, and I'm glad that the committee and the Democratic leadership have moved forward with a well-focused bill to improve the Department's management. 
   This bill continues the majority's strong record on homeland security. In a few short months, this Congress has passed bills to implement the 9/11 recommendations and to strengthen rail and public transportation security, each with strong bipartisan majorities. Each is a component of a comprehensive approach to protecting our constituents from potential threats. 
   I applaud the committee and the leadership for their consistent focus on homeland security. I understand that some Members have concerns that this bill does not address every issue, but part of the legislative process is working through these issues through the committees of jurisdiction. 
   It is important to keep in mind that Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King put forth a bipartisan bill during markup, and Chairman Thompson continues to work with other committees of jurisdiction in order to make sure that every aspect of our Nation's security is supported by Congress. 
   In particular, I applaud the chairman's record of shepherding 2 major homeland security bills through the House already. I think we should all agree that today's effort, the third homeland security bill in 4 months, makes substantial improvements to long-standing management issues within DHS. The rule and underlying bill shows a commitment of this Congress to working for a safe and secure America. 
   So I urge all Members to support both the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me emphasize to all Members that this bill is working its way through the legislative process. It is true that as a fair and responsible chairman, Mr. Thompson worked with several other committees of jurisdiction on this measure. As the manager's amendment clarifies, in some cases, the Homeland Security Committee proceeded with its language, and in others, it permitted other committees to lend their expertise to the issue in the coming months. This is the process of governing. 
   It is also true that the prior majority chose not to engage in this most basic of functions last year. They didn't bring an authorization bill to the floor, and by not engaging in this hard work, the prior majority let known problems go unresolved. 
   This bill brings overdue reform and accountability to the Department in its earliest Homeland Security authorization bill ever. That is responsible. That is governing.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I that consume. 
   Let me emphasize to Members the history on this issue. Unlike the prior majority, this majority is committed to passing a Homeland Security authorization into law. 
   In 2005, 2 years ago, the House passed an authorization after the appropriations bill passed. Last year, 2006, the House did not bother to bring a bill to the floor. That is irresponsible in light of the Department's many problems. 
   Democrats are committed to governing responsibly, and this is one step along that path.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to once again thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership in drafting a well-focused Homeland Security authorization and for working so closely with Ranking Member King on this bill. 
   I would note for all Members that Chairman Thompson worked with other chairmen and ranking members. The jurisdiction issues were raised by both sides, Republican and Democrat. I would also note that the manager's amendment which deals with these changes will receive separate debate and a vote. This is an open process. 
   Unlike the prior majority, we work through these issues. Again, last year when these problems were raised, the prior majority chose not to act. In contrast, we are acting despite these difficulties. We are being responsible. 
   H.R. 1684 will help improve the policy-making at the Department of Homeland Security, will promote long-term planning and will strengthen management. In particular, it sets qualifications for senior managers, increases coordination between agencies, and boosts funds for the Inspector General. These changes will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security can perform its important function of protecting the American people. 
   I am pleased that the Democratic leadership has moved swiftly and brought a Homeland Security authorization bill to the floor. This is the first time in 2 years such a bill has come to the floor. 
   It is also the earliest that a Department of Homeland Security authorization bill has come to the floor and the first time it has occurred before appropriators have marked up the Homeland Security appropriations bill. This is truly significant, and I thank the leadership for their commitment to protecting America. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me time and for her leadership on the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the underlying bill. Today presents us with another opportunity to change direction in Iraq, a change that is desperately needed. I have opposed this war from the beginning. I have long supported ways to bring this war to a responsible close. I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity now before we do further disservice to the brave men and women in Iraq. 
   The last time I rose in opposition to Iraq policy, I talked about George and Dee Heath from my hometown of Sacramento. All three of their sons served in Iraq. Recently, I learned that one of their sons, David, was hit in an RPG attack on his convoy. Thank goodness he was not wounded gravely, and he will be coming home to recover. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's vote is about our responsibility to the Heath sons and to the more than 150,000 other men and women in harm's way. They are doing what is being asked of them heroically and patriotically. It fills me with sorrow that more than 3,600 soldiers have paid the ultimate price for their heroism, including 385 from my home State of California. 
   Our responsibility to them as their elected leaders should be, it must be, to ensure that their mission is clear and achievable. Today, we have the opportunity to fulfill our responsibility as the President has not. Sadly, the President's disastrous leadership is ignoring his duty to the troops. We cannot sit idly by. 
   The Iraqi Government is not meeting any of its political, economic, or military benchmarks. The President's surge policy has had disastrous results. In fact, 600 troops have been killed and more than 3,000 have been wounded since he announced this policy. 
   Our troops are stranded on the front lines without clear guidance and without a clear mission. In light of such inept leadership by the President, the American people have lost their patience. Most Americans support removing troops by April. They want us to refocus on terrorism. Yet, still the President refuses to reconsider. It is clear from the President's blind stubbornness that Congress must show the President the way. 
   Our troops are at the breaking point. We are refereeing a civil war. The solution is a political one, not a military one. But in this late and crucial hour, you have to do more than talk about change. You have to vote for it. You have to fight for it. Chairman Skelton's bill keeps the safety of our troops and our Nation's security at the forefront by changing course in Iraq. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment to the GIVE Act. The Matsui-Shays amendment makes needed changes to national service and carries with it broad support. Our amendment will combine the two separate State competitive funds and national competitive funds into one singular funding pool. This change will improve national service efficiency and effectiveness, while increasing collaboration between State and national interests. 
   Every year organizations and the individuals they support are turned away from the grants they need because of high demand or simple administrative burdens. The current funding formula gives approximately one-third of the funding to the States based on population, approximately one-third to State competitive grants, and approximately one-third to a national competitive funding pool. Under the current formula, a high demand for State competitive grants means that State grant applicants are turned away even if there are resources still available in the national pool and vice versa. 
   Additionally, these deserving nonprofits and community service organizations spend far too many of their valuable resources navigating a confusing applications process and managing multiple grants. If this amendment passes, these precious resources will now be used to better serve their communities. 
   At its heart the amendment ensures that grants are competitively distributed based on merit and that resources are used in the most efficient and effective manner. 
   I hope that all of my colleagues will join Congressman Shays and myself, as well as the Governor-appointed State service commissions, national service organizations, leading nonprofits, and Members from both sides of the aisle in support of this valuable amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

The rule makes in order the Education and Labor Committee-reported substitute as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. 
   The rule makes in order 11 amendments, which are listed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution. Each amendment is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a vital piece of legislation, legislation that directly affects all of our communities and the lives of millions of Americans; legislation that strengthens our communities, helps educate our future generations, teaches our youth to prepare for and respond to unthinkable tragedies, and fosters the growth of respect and compassion throughout our entire society. 
   The Corporation for National Community Service estimates that in 2006 the national service participants provided the Nation with nearly $4 billion worth of service projects. The GIVE Act reauthorizes our country's investment in community service and volunteerism. 
   As co-chair of the National Service Caucus, it is a pleasure to call attention to the tremendous work of those involved at every level and in every program of the corporation. 
   Madam Speaker, service and volunteerism are the bedrock of our emergency preparedness and national security. In times of strife, the American people have always shown a spirit of service and ingenuity. Investing in service and volunteer programs prepares us to handle any crisis. We must focus on building our national capacity, and harnessing the enterprising spirit of the American people is a good way to do so. In the wake of a catastrophe, a first responder is likely to be a civilian. A neighbor is likely to be the first one to provide assistance. By building up our service and volunteer programs, we are taking proactive steps to bolster our national security and capability to weather a disaster now and in the years to come. 
   We saw firsthand the importance of having trained volunteers in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes. These forever changed thousands of lives and communities in the gulf coast. We watched as men and women mourned their loved ones and remembered the lives they once had. We also witnessed an outpouring of support and compassion from individuals who were touched by this immense tragedy. 
   Following the devastation in the gulf coast, more than 92,000 national service volunteers contributed over 3.5 million hours of service to the recovery effort. They repaired neighborhoods. They rebuilt lives. Our national service participants have also applied their expertise towards training local community volunteers, further expanding the network of effective workers to 260,000 people. 
   The assistance from volunteers following the devastating storms represents only one example of the many accomplishments that our service volunteers achieve every single day. Through programs such as AmeriCorps State and National, Volunteers in Service to America, and National Civilian Community Corps, AmeriCorps volunteers address critical needs in our communities. 
   When I am home in Sacramento, I am reminded by my constituents of the great work done by AmeriCorps NCCC volunteers. AmeriCorps NCCC members are disaster trained and available for immediate deployment in the event of a natural disaster anywhere within the United States, as they were to the gulf coast. In fact, NCCC teams have responded to every national disaster since the program was established. 
   Over $26 million worth of hurricane recovery resources have come from AmeriCorps NCCC alone, which is more than we spent on the entire program nationwide. This is quite a return on our investment. 
   The GIVE Act will strengthen the emergency preparedness and response training of our country's NCCC participants. The changes will also help the program continue to grow. Recently, the corporation added two new campuses, one in Iowa and one in Mississippi. 
   The GIVE Act recognizes the work of every volunteer in this country. It seeks to reach out to more people to greatly expand the number of volunteers across this country. Our bill will expand AmeriCorps membership from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012. The bill seeks to tap the growing pool of baby boomers reaching retirement that wish to continue serving their country by lowering the age of participation in Senior Corps to 55 from 60 years old. Equally important is that the bill harnesses the energy of future generations in addition to the baby boomers. 
   Engaging our youth early on is vitally important to the safety of our communities and the lives of our children. The Summer of Service program  will ensure that students making the transition from middle to high school have an opportunity to participate in service programs. By increasing the education award, the bill allows young service participants to apply the skills that they learn in volunteerism to a successful education. The benefits of service will continue to accrue to volunteers even after they complete their service. 
   Madam Speaker, as a result of the great work of the AmeriCorps members, extraordinary things are happening all over America. The corporation supports such important nonprofit organizations as Habitat for Humanity, City Year, and Red Cross. 
   National service participants have built homes, healed wounds, and taught elementary school kids. These volunteers are part of the backbone of our country. With very little funding, service participants leverage millions of dollars and perform crucial work in classrooms, national parks, and areas of our Nation hit by disaster. 
   As a result, I hope my colleagues will support the rule and the underlying legislation. The spirit of service that is so important to all of our communities is one that should be encouraged and supported. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, first, I would like to say that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act continues to give the intelligence community the tools it needs to monitor terrorists. The government always has the option of tapping targets immediately and returning to the FISA Court within 72 hours to obtain an order. 
   My constituents and those of other Members of Congress view the protection of civil liberties as one of their top priorities. The American people want us to do our representational duty to uphold the Constitution and deliberate on this issue. We are working hard to ensure that our national security needs are met as our constitutional rights are protected. 
   Now we are working to support national service in our country, which helps our communities respond to disasters and also encourages our youth to engage in civic participation. Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting with Tatiana, a strong and determined young woman from Sacramento, my hometown, who received an award for CorpsMember of the Year. When Tatiana was just 15, her mother was incarcerated, and later, she was expelled from high school. Meeting with her and hearing her story of how she used the local Conservation Corps to turn her life around was truly inspiring. 
   This reauthorization takes programs and infrastructure that have touched so many lives, such as Tatiana, and builds off its foundation to greatly increase the quality and quantity and improve national service. National service is a proven return on our investment. With this bill, we will broaden those involved in service, and in doing so, foster the values of civic engagement and duty that can change a life and also draw upon the lessons of guidance and wisdom of our seniors that only a lifetime of experience can provide. 
   This bipartisan legislation makes excellent improvements to an already successful Federal agency. It improves access and support for organizations and grant applicants, and most importantly, reassures our valued volunteers that Congress supports them and their work. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Ms. MATSUI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2537, BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1083 provides an open rule with a preprinting requirement for consideration of H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007. 
   The resolution provides 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   Some of our Nation's greatest treasures are the beautiful beaches that surround our country. So many of us have spent time with our families and friends enjoying our country's picturesque coastlines. Our beaches not only provide a place for relaxation and recreation, they are also a vital economic engine that draws tourists from all over the globe. 
   As a mother and a grandmother, I want to ensure that our Nation's children are swimming and enjoying our beaches that are safe and free of any harmful contamination. Unfortunately, a recent EPA report found that human health studies over the last 50 years have linked swimming and polluted water with significant adverse health effects. Swimming-related diseases can range from minor gastrointestinal diseases to more serious illnesses such as meningitis or hepatitis. 
   This is extremely troubling and is a great concern to all of us. According to the National List of Beaches, only 57 percent of the Nation's coastal recreation areas are being monitored. 
   In my home State of California, 114 of our 356 beaches are not monitored, leaving a huge amount of people at risk. That is why I would like to thank Representative Pallone for his work on such an important piece of legislation, legislation that builds on the ambitious vision that the 1972 Clean Water Act set forth. 
   As an original author of the 2000 bill, my friend from New Jersey has long been recognized for his efforts to clean up our Nation's beaches. 
   I would also like to thank Representative Tim Bishop for his leadership and work on this issue.  
   The Beach Protection Act builds on the great effort of the original BEACH Act and is a vital tool that will help ensure the safety of our national coastal treasures. Under the 2000 BEACH Act, the EPA was required to work with States to ensure they use the latest science to test beach waters to protect the public health. 
   States are required to notify the public if tests showed water quality standards were violated. The law also helps States set up monitoring and notification programs in order to provide up-to-date information on the condition of all public beaches. 
   H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, advances the good work of the original act and takes us into the next generation of water monitoring. The bill increases the authorization through 2012 for the EPA's beach program by $10 million to $40 million per year. This money will be used to provide grants to States along the coasts and Great Lakes for recreational water monitoring and notification programs. 
   H.R. 2537 also clarifies and enhances public notification when coastal waters are likely contaminated. Visitors to our beaches need to know when there is potential threat to their health. The bill clarifies that the public must be notified within 24 hours when a contaminated water sample is found. The bill also requires that a physical sign must be posted at any beach where the water may be contaminated. This information is essential for public awareness and avoidance of harmful pollutants. 
   H.R. 2537 also promotes increased compliance. It requires the EPA administrator to conduct an annual review of implementation by State and local governments. If the public is not being protected, it requires the EPA to take corrective actions. 
   Representative Pallone has shown tremendous leadership with this bill that puts public safety at the forefront and goes to great lengths to protect our Nation's beaches. I know he has worked closely with my friend and colleague, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. 
   Later today we will debate the chairwoman's manager's amendment that directs the EPA to complete and use a rapid-testing technology. This type of testing is intended to shorten the period between when a water sample is taken and when results are made public. When this testing is in place, the period of time necessary for testing coastal waters is likely to shorten from 24 to simply 2 or 3 hours. 
   Passage of the Beach Protection Act of 2007 is an important step to promoting public health and ensuring that the millions of people who visit our coastal treasures remain safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring us back to the measure at hand which is H. Res. 1083 which provides for consideration of H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, and I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Rules Committee.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thought we were doing a rule and not special orders right now. 
   We are working on the rule for the beaches, and we want to keep Americans safe from water pollutants. 
   I want to say we have an obligation to ensure Americans are safe and healthy, and this act would do it.

   Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   First, let me say that there is no need to open up more sensitive natural areas to drilling. The United States has 3 percent of the world's resources but 25 percent of the demand. It is obvious that there is no way for us to drill our way to energy independence. 
   If we are really concerned about lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign oil, we need to invest in renewable resources, and we have passed legislation to do just that. 
   The open rule before us today is a fair rule that allows for debate on the important issues that face our country, from water pollutants to public health concerns. It is Congress' responsibility to set high standards and assert proper oversight of these issues. 
   The underlying bill, H.R. 2537, takes huge steps to promote public health throughout the great beaches of our country and ensure that our beaches will be preserved for future generations to enjoy and benefit from. 
   Congress has a distinct obligation to future generations to keep our water clean and preserve our beaches. This bill increases funding for States to effectively monitor the coasts, ensure swift public notification and takes us into the next generation of water monitoring. We have a commitment to keep the millions who visit our beaches safe and informed. This bill does just that, and I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.
